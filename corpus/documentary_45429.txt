This adventure takes the viewer from Vienna to Barcelona with an Austrian Airlines' A321 above the entire East-West route of the Alps. Captain Hans Klikovich and his co-pilot Conny Ollinger fly the passengers of the OS397 - thanks to a public holiday and 'helpful air traffic controller' - at a particularly low altitude (7000m) from Vienna over the expanse of the Alps along the Cote d'Azur ending ultimately in Barcelona.
