In this lighthearted Dutch format using as title an expression literally meaning "on land at sea and in the air" candidates from the public at large demonstrate in open air how long and far they can keep going (sometimes only a few meters) in a self-constructed sort of go-cart before crashing (usually in the water). Many stake more on originality and the entertainment value of a crazy flashy design in some cases obviously more of a hindrance the an asset or participate just for the fun rather then actually aiming at a winning performance.
