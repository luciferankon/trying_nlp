Echoing the distinctive and much celebrated great British Gothic Horror films of the 1960-70s The House of Screaming Death will uphold their successful traditions with the telling of four macabre tales of terror all told by the mysterious Architect. Each horrific segment delves into explicit corners of the supernatural summoning such damned creations as the ghostly Lady in Grey stories of Witchcraft most foul Vampirism and the Occult. But as these horrifying tales unfold with nightmarish conclusions the Architect also has one last shocking secret of his own to tell. A dark and stormy night... A collector of the macabre weaves four tales of terror for a group of very special guests. "The Lady in Grey" - 1943; as the flames of war spread a veteran of the Great War looks back on the history of Bray Manor and the ghosts that haunt him and the hallways of the ancient house. "The Witch in the Mirror" - 1970; Lily Proctor inherits the old house and as the spirit of a witch trapped in the Netherworld by the spectral Necromancers tries desperately to escape back into our realm a dark secret from Lily's past is revealed. "The Vampyre" - 1888; following a string of killings a young gentleman comes to Bray Manor. Painted as an outcast by the villagers he befriends a helpless stranger but his kind heart may be his own undoing. "The Diabolique" - Sam Campbell finds himself at the center of strange happenings as an ancient demonic spirit strives to break into our world. Each of these stories has a sting in its tail but the final revelations of who the Architect is may just be the biggest shock of all.
