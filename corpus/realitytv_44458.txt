Every weekend the two presenters go to different cities in the world. According to the rules of the program one have to live on Saturday and Sunday spending just $ 100 while the second can spend unlimited funds which are stored on a golden card. In order to decide which of them will live like a millionaire and who will learn to survive presenters toss a coin before each travel and each time it is all about Heads or Tails.
