Thailand. In the wake of a colour-coded military coup an artist transforms a 49-story abandoned tower by turning it bright red. This short documentary film compliments the large-scale unsanctioned public artwork "MONUMENT" by Liam Morgan. The artwork is a monument to the mis-management crony-ism corruption and ill-floating economy which ultimately led up to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. The film travels through the present-day ubiquity of monumental advertisements in public spaces which come across as visual intrusion or oppression a desperate (re-)inflation of an economic bubble squeezing from all sides.
