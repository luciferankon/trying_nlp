In one of his final appearances Orson Welles reads a moving passage from a diary written by Charles Lindberg who wrote a lovely message to comfort a dying friend. Sitting behind a typewriter looking quite frail but still with a great presence Orson provides a positive and emotional reading using one of his many talents: his deep voice.
