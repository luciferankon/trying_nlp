Theofilos Ferekis is the new minister of Health and Welfare who has to deal with all the "favours" he promised during the pre election period. As soon as he realizes that he will not easily pull off he decides to hire a... professional liar. Theodoros Parlas or Pseftothodoros (Liar Theo) who has a great "talent" for making false promises starts a great career as Ferekis' right hand man. One lie leads to another and they soon need a lot more lies to handle hilarious situations. 50 years later the play of Dimitris Psathas remains a classic.
