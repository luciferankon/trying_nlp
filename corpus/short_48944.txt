Dramatizing the scenarios portrayed in Danielle French's song of the same name "Time to Kill" presents a rather surreal twist on the age-old boy-meets-girl-story. Scarlett and Raven spot each other across the room at a fantasy-themed costume party and are irresistibly drawn to one another. Scarlett begins to fantasize... A sequence of vignettes unfolds in which Scarlett imagines a variety of unusual locations where she and Raven could perhaps meet for a bizarre series of dream dates... that is if they both have time to kill.
