Blake is a talented acting student as well as an unrealistic dreamer when it comes down to how to make a living until he makes it "big". Continuously fired from minimum wage employment Blake and his best friend Elliot get sucked into the dangerous world of gambling. Luckily Blake's sister Angela has proven to be a reliable roommate and so far taken care of her irresponsible younger brother. When a car crash on the way to a job interview lands her in the hospital Blake offers to start the job in his sister's place which turns out to be more complicated than expected: His ward is the homely and socially inept 20-year-old agoraphobic Giselle who insists on a *female* assistant. However the girl and her mother have never met Angela in person and thus Blake is able to transform himself into a convincingly enough version of his sister. Realizing this gives him an opportunity to not only hide from the bookies but also from his visiting alcoholic mother Blake moves gladly in with the disabled Giselle. At first reluctant but consequently learning "how to be a girl" first in order to show Giselle how to be one Blake unknowingly starts "grooming" Giselle into his dream girl.
