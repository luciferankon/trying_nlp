On the first day of shooting James Franco David Shields and Caleb Powell throw out the script when a real life argument breaks out between the three of them about what can and can't be used in the film. Shields and Franco browbeat Powell to sacrifice everything for the sake of the film; Powell threatens to leave; Shields feels guilty about betraying Powell and Franco hopes for all this to be resolve and focus in the film. A debate nearly to the death about life and art.
