Since 1975 thousands of hill tribe Hmong have fled Laos' communist government which hunts them down for having sided with the US during the Vietnam War. In late 2004 Hmong refugees arrived in the northern Thai village of Nam Khao. On July 4th 2005 the Thai government evicted the Hmong onto the street denying them shelter food and water and preparing to send them back to Laos. For the government these are not refugees. They are illegal migrants.
