For thousands of years in all cultures and religions people have been describing their mystical states and experiences. As a mystical experience "KUNDALINI" can be described as "self-realization" dissolution of personal boundaries with a sense of becoming one with other people with nature the universe and God - the center of all creation. The word "KUNDALINI" originates in the pre-Vedic form of Hinduism. It represents the all-powerful cosmic energy unifying both the physical and spiritual aspects of our existence. Yet peak experiences are not only part of our religious past. On the contrary they are described by many modern psychologists as a unique state in the evolution of the human psyche. If allowed to reach their natural completion they typically result in a better function of the body and a fuller capacity to express one's creative potential.
