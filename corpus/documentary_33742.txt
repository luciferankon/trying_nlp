Gardasil also known as the Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine is given as a series of three shots over six months to protect against HPV infection and its associated health problems. Two vaccines (Cervarix and Gardasil) are said to protect against cervical cancers in women. Gardasil is also said to protect against genital warts and cancers of the anus vagina and vulva. Both vaccines are available for females while only Gardasil is available for males. The Centers For Disease Control (CDC) claims that the HPV vaccine offers the best protection to girls and boys who receive all three vaccine doses and have time to develop an immune response before being sexually active. This is why it is recommended for children who have reached the age of 11 or 12. One More Girl is an answer to Merck and Co's "One Less Girl" marketing campaign for Gardasil. The parents who encouraged their daughters to get the HPV vaccine did so on the advice of their doctors their government and their belief in the pharmaceutical industry. They were not "anti-vaccine"; they played by the rules and now they are paying the price. It's a documentary that has several experts from the industry doctors and university researchers speaking out about the vaccine.
