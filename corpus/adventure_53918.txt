In the seventeenth century Robinson Crusoe is shipwrecked on a desert island and is the only survivor. He takes steps to get food and shelter hoping one day to be rescued. One day a band of black men arrive by boat and are about to execute one of their number; Crusoe saves him and drives them off and names the man Friday and teaches him Crusoe's on language. They survive together but will they ever be rescued?
