Almost a hundred million Americans don't vote. Even when they're electing their president and with that the most powerful political leader in the world. A year before the presidential elections of 2008 a crew of young European filmmakers goes on a journey all across the country in a little old motor home to search for America's missing voters. Who are they? Why don't they vote? Can a young and fresh presidential candidate as Barack Obama make them vote? How would American politics change if more young people single women poor white people African-Americans and Latino's would start voting? Who better than Oprah could get America's non-voters to vote in 2008.
