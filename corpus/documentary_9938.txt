The Boston Celtics have won 16 Championships. Only one professional sports franchise in any sport in any country has won more. But it has been almost a quarter century since the Celtics's last championship. That drought had been made even more pronounced by the recent success of both the New England Patriots and Boston Red Sox. Then came the trades. With two stunning off-season deals the team that taught Boston how to win is back at the head of the class. "Return to the Rafters" is a unique chronicle of the Celtics' effort to bring their present and future in line with their past. With the passing of Coach Red Auerbach in 2006 General Manager Danny Ainge and Head Coach Doc Rivers were left to navigate the team's course back to the place that Auerbach's Celtics knew so well. The film follows Doc and Danny's efforts as they pursue a return to glory. Off court scenes of the players give a rare look at the team as it tries to become a cohesive unit once more. The apprehension that is born out of a quarter century of disappointments is captured in the eyes and words of the team's fans new and old which have been starved of the taste of championship on which they were weaned. "Return to the Rafters" tells the compelling story of a team which must overcome not only its opponents but also its own legacy to achieve its goal.
