Storm Under the Sun is a documentary about one of the "political storms" by Mao Zedong that fell upon the intellectuals of China in the 50's. Centered around the Hu Feng Case the documentary traces the synergy that generated such an event Mao's personal involvement in every step and various victims' reaction to and realizations following the humiliation and accusations. Chairman Mao Zedong was looked upon as "the Red Sun" in China. Many regarded him as the "God" who saved the Chinese people from years of war and suffering but Mao's deity status was achieved by destroying the autonomy of Chinese intellectuals silencing them through the implementation of Communist regime and a series of political "storms." Storm under the Sun is about the storm which fell upon Hu Feng a renowned writer and literary theorist since the 1930s. He founded the July and Hope magazines and nurtured a generation of poets and writers. The Communist Party organized rounds of systematic criticism on Hu Feng between 1944 and 1954. In 1955 Mao personally directed a nation-wide campaign against him and his friends. The Hu Feng Case resulted in the imprisonment of 92 Chinese intellectuals mostly poets and writers and led to the incrimination of more than 2100 people. Some of these victims were Hu Feng's friends or students but most only knew him through his works. This documentary is the first to revisit these events after more than half a century inviting nearly thirty survivors of the harsh "storm" to reveal the cruel truths that lie beneath China's official history. Archive footage animations woodcut prints and original music are used to enrich the narrative.
