It is an end-of-summer afternoon and Kate and Mandy are messing around in a deserted lido. They are bored and it feels like nothing ever happens. In the pool Ruth is underwater and Kate and Mandy are waiting to see how long she can hold her breath. A short humorous journey to that strange limbo land of uncertainty between being underwater and being above between childhood and growing up.
