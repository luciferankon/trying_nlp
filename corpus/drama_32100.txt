Mary a student filmmaker takes her two estranged brothers on a road trip to finish her thesis film project 'Conspiracies in America' and to find out what happened on 9-11-01 when their father disappeared. They travel 5600 miles in 16 days in a motor home debating the left/right paradigm. By the time they get to New York City and ground zero something has drastically changed in the Hart family as they find out their mother is dying of cancer what happened to their father and that the left/right paradigm is a hoax designed to keep people infighting. A hybrid of script improvisation and documentary that appears like reality staged too.
