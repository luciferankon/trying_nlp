''They're drying up the street'' is a slang term wich means that the police are stopping the supply of heroin from reaching street addicts. A heroin addict while in hospital after a severe overdose is visited by an RCMP officer who wants to make a deal - they will help him find the daughter he lost when he became an addict if he will help them break up a drug importing operation.
