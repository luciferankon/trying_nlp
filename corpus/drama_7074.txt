Set in the Soviet Union in the 70s. Modernization of Soviet metallurgical industry causes a clash between old style Communist bosses and the new generation of engineers and managers. Engineer Ruzaev (Aleksandr Mikhailov) is introducing innovations in technology but Soviet reality makes it hard for him. Outdated infrastructure causes a cascade of problems then a major explosion shakes the old metal works where a giant melting pot blows up. Tons of melted steel pour out causing a catastrophe alluding to dangerous state of affairs in the Soviet Union. Now old-style bosses must be replaced with forward thinking managers.
