A malevolent murderous spirit infects the souls of living hosts claiming new victims like an occult virus. A year ago MAYA held her best friend in her arms as she lay dying killed by this evil entity. But the diabolic Visitant didn't die with her friend - it lived on in Maya. Now Maya accidentally passes the entity on to an unsuspecting neighbor a single mother LESLIE with two teenage girls AMANDA and SARAH. Almost immediately the hair-raising paranormal attacks begin first with Leslie. She then inadvertently passes the spirit on to her older daughter Amanda who is discovered speaking to the ghost in her sleep. But the horror escalates when the youngest daughter Sarah gets "infected" - she is so susceptible she actually becomes an active host to the evil. Sarah is even driven to kill. Now Leslie and Amanda - with the help of Maya and Lee another former host to this insidious phantom - fight to save Sarah and themselves before it's too late. As they band together to prepare for an unprecedented metaphysical battle they discover more about the origin of the entity - which is the most terrifying thing of all.
