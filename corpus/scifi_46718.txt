After a hacker-inspired civil war devastates the population destroying modern technology a bookish introvert (ELLIOT PRATT) is recruited into a promising new regime (The CEA) to scout for other survivors. After abusing his new-found status he pisses off the wrong people landing a bounty on his head. Out on the lamb Elliot befriends NIVEA a feisty knife-fighter who takes him in to work at her small town farm. Ambushed by a bounty hunter Nivea defends her property killing the intruder as Elliot flees. His escape is short-lived when he is captured by "the Grinch" and used as bait to entice others for the rolling. Nivea is punished without trail and forced to work in a brothel disguised as a prison strip club. Now she must band together or go it alone to escape her brutal surroundings and take back what is rightly hers.
