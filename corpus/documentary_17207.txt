O Tardo is mythological figure that inhabits the minds of older generations in Portugal Galicia and Asturias. However you'd be surprised to find that the names is almost the only common trace that the legend has when you move from one place to the other. In some places you find that the Tardo is something like a Werewolf only it transforms into more domesticated animals. In other places is just the soul of a small child who died and wanders around with no malicious intent. In this documentary we aim to show this multiple angles of the same legend while understanding the differences and their social context. Also we get to immortalize these tales that are getting lost in time as younger generations fail to get the message from the older ones.
