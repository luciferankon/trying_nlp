TV's former "Barney Fife" Don Knotts hosted this variety show that contained a bit of music but mostly comedy skits and sketches featuring Knotts guest stars and a talented supporting cast. One regular bit was called "The Front Porch" which consisted of Knotts and that week's guest rocking on a porch and talking.
