PRAY is an exploration of mankind`s conversations with the Holy. What divides us makes us alike. Beautifully shot on location in Jerusalem Sahara Himalaya Ganges and Norway. By being present in prayer in places most don't have access to Lars Petter Gallefoss has created a universal story about the foundation of all religion. PRAY covers the major world religions - and then some. Despite being a film about speaking to God PRAY is a purely observational documentary bereft of dialogue which masters the mantra 'Show don't tell'.
