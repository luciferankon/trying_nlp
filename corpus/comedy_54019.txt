Richard is a hopeless romantic. That is he wants romance but he's hopeless. Like many single men he has an inflated opinion of himself. He's quite good at overlooking his own flaws so why can't he overlook them in others? When his latest relationship crumbles Richard invites an ex-girlfriend to lunch thinking perhaps she was the one for him. In their one-sided conversation Richard recounts his most recent love affairs and comes to terms with what he sees as his greatest flaw - he just hasn't met the right woman! His last three relationships seemed to send him the same message. But will he figure out what it is in time to recognize the imperfect woman who's perfect for him?
