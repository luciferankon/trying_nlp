Philip Nolan III refuses to fight for the cause of democracy. His father Philip Nolan II who has failed in his efforts to convince his son of the fallacy of arguments then lays bare all the details of the shameful treason of his own ancestor the first Philip Nolan "The Man Without a Country." The father's story shows how the first Philip Nolan played into the hands of Aaron Burr; how Thomas Jefferson was elected president over Burr; how Alexander Hamilton prevented the conscienceless Burr becoming governor of New York; the duel between Hamilton and Burr; how Philip Nolan was later arrested on his wedding night for aiding Burr who had conspired to start a rival government in the south to wage war against the United States and how he was later banished from the United States for saying "Damn the United States! I wish I might never hear its name again" and how Philip Nolan died kissing the flag of the country he had execrated. Deeply moved Philip Nolan III loses no time in joining the boys in khaki.
