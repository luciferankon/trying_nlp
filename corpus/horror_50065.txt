This unique horror trilogy is three non-budget shorts in one and based on a true story about an electrician who suddenly went missing while repairing a blown fuse in a creepy basement near an abandoned military area in Denmark. The electrician is the focal point in the three shorts - but the blown fuse is apparently not the only problem in the dark corridors.
