A musical revue that basically has Paramount stars and contract-players doing things some had never done on screen and wouldn't again; such as Ruth Chatteron  in a French-caf√© setting singing "My Marine" (written by Richard A. Whiting and Raymond B. Eagan) to a group of U. S. Marines including Stuart Eriwn Stanley Smith and Frederic March; Buddy Rogers doing a song-duet with Lillian Roth called "Any Time's the Time to Fall in Love" (written by Elise Jans and Jack King) on a cuckoo-clock set; and Clara Bow singing and dancing in the "True To The Nany Now" number to a group of sailors.
