Seven convicts run away from a penal colony to a town destroyed by an earthquake in search of their relatives. An old captain goes after them with a two-day liberty order for each of them. But liberty in the destroyed world permeated with the stench of corpses and perpetuities is no longer necessary. The film is about the on-going catastrophe of the human soul.
