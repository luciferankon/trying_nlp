Comedy about the horrors of shooting a low budget feature in modern day Miami and everything that that can possible go wrong on set. The story is told through the eyes of Alex Gonzalez a pothead who is kidnapped by his best friend Chris during a minor drug transaction and forced to be a PA on the set of an ultra low budget movie. Alex has no idea what a PA does or what it takes to make a movie but he has common sense which is lacking heavily on this set. Chris promises Alex that he'll drive him home as soon as they get the first shot completed; but for this feature getting anything in the can is a major task.
