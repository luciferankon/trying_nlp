Hoping to create a special memento to celebrate the fifth anniversary of their relationship Young-joon (Song) and Joon-seok (Jo) bring a camcorder to a motel room they have rented for the night. With five years behind them they both speak and touch each other as if their mutual love will never be shaken. However as the night progresses the air is stifled with the trite memories and self-reproach they share. As the camcorder continues to roll it becomes increasing clear that this may very well be their last night together.
