At the opening of our film there exists two separate worlds in Battersea - the world of the social climber and the world of Oxbridge graduates - each containing a small group of characters upon whom we focus the audiences' interest. Our drama consists in the collisions of these two worlds that stand in direct opposition to each other. Both of these worlds rarely come into contact with each other except through the Tottenham Theologian who weaves his way between Tottenham and Battersea.
