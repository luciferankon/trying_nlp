As long as Shane Morgan can remember he has lived on the road with his mother and father a rodeo performer. Their dreams of making enough money to settle down happily in one place are shattered when a traffic accident kills his mother and his father takes so badly to drink that Shane becomes the de facto head of the household. When his grandfather dies leaving Shane a small ranch in his will he hopes that his dream might come true at last. But how can a 14-year-old boy turn the run-down place around and keep the banker from seizing it while attending school and looking after a father who is usually in the liability column?
