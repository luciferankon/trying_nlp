Shirley Temple's remarkable life is gloriously portrayed in this 100-minute video with archival footage of her appearances in numerous films and commentary by some of the famous people who knew and worked with her. The title on my DVD is BIOGRAPHY "Shirley Temple: the Biggest Little Star" (1996) There isn't as much detail as in the best-selling autobiographical book "Child Star" but the clips in this video are a priceless testament to the little girl who became the most famous child in history. Why did the world of the 1930s fall in love with Shirley Temple? Was she a genius? See this biography and try to answer that question yourself.
