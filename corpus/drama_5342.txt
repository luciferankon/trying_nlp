Small town lawyer Harmon Cobb defends a Nazi prisoner of war against murder charges. Set during World War II Cobb has to contend with the difficulties of defending the devil when the town's only doctor (Barnard Hughes) dies while at "Camp Bremen" in the fictitious town of Bremen Colorado. Local residents are outraged when their small town's doctor is murdered while at a nearby military base during World War II. A suspect is soon named: Nazi prisoner of war Domsczek. The trial is mounted quickly -- but few want to defend such a heinous criminal. The onus falls on lawyer Harmon Cobb who was best friends with the victim. Cobb will have to overcome both grief and social stigma in order to maintain his integrity while defending Domsczek. Harman Cobb is a small town lawyer it's 1944 and his son is fighting in Europe. A German prisoner at the local POW camp is accused of murdering the town's doctor and Harman is railroaded into defending him. Harman is not at all interested in defending the German; the whole town have booked their seat for the hanging. However a note written by the victim reveals that the case isn't as straightforward as it first appeared.
