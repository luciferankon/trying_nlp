Mickey Minnie Donald Goofy Tigger and the Fun Song Kids hit the waves and have a ball! The kids hangout at Blizzard Beach Typhoon Lagoon Shark Reef and Disney's Polynesian Resort. What a cool place to have oceans of fun with some great beach tunes such as: "Celebration" "Surfin' Safari" "Hot Hot Hot" "Limbo Rock" and 7 other great beach songs. Kids will love it and some adults even do because of the "catchy" tunes! This made for video release features "real" children singing a bunch of familiar songs in settings throughout Disney World. You'll see the kids snorkeling playing at Blizzard Beach pretending to surf and singing about pirates' treasure aboard the ship from Peter Pan (Peter Captain Hook and all the gang are there too!) Ariel from The Little Mermaid even makes an appearance. Several of the songs will already be somewhat familiar to kids but in case they aren't the words are at the bottom of the screen (assuming the kids can read.)
