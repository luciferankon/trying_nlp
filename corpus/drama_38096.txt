One day of autumn 1950 during the forced collectivization the farmers lead their cattle into the common stables of the new cooperative. The cooperative's chairman Picin publicly calls out the farmers' names. Only one among the farmers - the rich farmer Konvalinka - opposes the imposed violence in a horrific way shooting all his cattle and himself committing suicide. The village witnesses the return of Konvalinka's daughter nicknamed Miss ('Jana Brejchová' (qv)) a former nun whose cloister was closed by the new regime. She is running the remaining property alone only with the help of the village fool Ambroz ('Gustáv Valach' (qv)).
