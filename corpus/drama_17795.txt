One abortion. One IVF. Two women haunted by life lost share their exploration of pleasure motherhood and independence through a series of emotional events which happened in a small abortion clinic in southern China and the chilly interiors of their nightmares. The film comments on birth death and choices in between. It's a philosophical consideration of time and a lament on the loss of it.
