Homeboys centres around a dysfunctional family living in Manchester - Terry and Eileen are trying to get their lives back by getting their 20something sons to finally leave home. But David and Brian have other plans despite their parents' best efforts to get rid of them. David is a cocky damp-proofing salesman who thinks he's a big shot (but who still loves having his pants washed by his mum) and Brian is an agoraphobic who hasn't left the house since he was eight and spends a lot of time under the kitchen table. Add Janine their spiteful younger sister to the mix and their parents' dream of a quiet life looks more and more unlikely...although they'd secretly miss all the mayhem their kids cause if they ever did leave home!
