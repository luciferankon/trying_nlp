Healthcare system is now confronting serious problems worsened by an ever aging population. Time to think. Dr. Fernando Diz-Lois and his colleagues Drs. Fernando de la Iglesia and Emilio Casariego review the question at its roots in the doctor-patient encounter showing how a clinical eye works and leading us towards the need for a change in our medical framework. It's becoming necessary to go beyond a medical model characterised by the distance between patient and doctor the standardisation of the approach to the patient and the overuse of technology and pharmacological therapies with the ensuing expenditure increase and a break in the accompaniment of the sick person. To engage the viewer our documentary enriches these reflections with dramatisations of several clinical cases commented by Dr. Diz-Lois and performed by first-class actors that allow us to effectively connect information and emotion. A new medicine must focus on the one who suffers the sickness: the human being. Therefore healing can only be found through the encounter with another human being: the attentive doctor.
