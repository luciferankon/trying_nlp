In January 2009 while Israel is bombarding Gaza Rashid Masharawi is in Baghdad making a film on young children forced to work in post-war Iraq. Contrasting their lives with those of similarly burdened Gazan children the film presents a world in which everyone no matter how young has to struggle to survive. As a Palestinian and Gazan with extensive personal experience of life in refugee camps Masharawi's deep sense of identification with the children's traumas makes for a deeply affecting and authoritative document of local situation.
