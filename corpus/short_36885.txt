Big Brothers Big Sisters Australia (BBBS) is charitable organisation providing mentoring support to children at risk of disengagement with their families and society. BBBS has a list of 647 children desperately waiting to be paired with a big-brother or big-sister mentor however due financial constraints BBBS cannot recruit the staff required to scrutinise candidates place suitable mentors and assign case managers on an ongoing basis. This pro-bono commercial by Bengar Films is designed to raise $1 Million to resource the organisation and clear the waiting list of children at risk. They need to raise funds. The team at Bengar Films believes in fostering and supporting those that need help- especially children. Every child deserves to be happy and confident with a balanced environment to reach their potential. We are please to offer out supper to BBBS and hope this commercial helps. Our sincere to Network Ten for their help and support of the project.
