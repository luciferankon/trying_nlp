The record of a human intervention in nature: A static shot shows part of a landscape a serene body of water in front of a mountain. A motorboat enters the picture from the right obeying the directions sent by radio and forming a spiral in the water's surface. The boat then turns to the left and leaves the scene; solely its wake is visible for a time.
