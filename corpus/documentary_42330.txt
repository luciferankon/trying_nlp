On February 10 1990 two cowards walked into the Las Cruces Bowl and changed the lives of many people. Seven people inside the bowling alley were forced at gunpoint to the floor and told to put their heads down. After stealing thousands of dollars from the safe the killers shot all seven multiple times at close range execution-style. The shooters then started a fire on the desk and fled. Dead at the scene were Amy Houser Steven Teranand his step-daughter Paula. Steven's daughter Valerie died 45 minutes later at the hospital. Incredibly Melissia Repass Stephanie C. Senac and Ida Holguin survived the brutal attack. Repass just twelve at the time made the heroic 911 call despite being shot in the headwhich saved three lives. Four out of the seven shot were children including a two and six year old. For almost twenty years the two remaining survivors(Senac died in 1999) family members and friends have had to live with this unspeakable event. The case is unsolved after twenty years and the Las Cruces Police Dept. the FBI and Crimestoppers plead for your help.
