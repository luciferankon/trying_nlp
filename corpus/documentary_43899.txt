A myth has been circulating in Poland for over 70 years. That Myth has now become global news. A WWII train possibly carrying gold artefacts and even a secret chemical weapon has supposedly been discovered in south west Poland deep in old Nazi Germany territory. Yet no one has ever seen this train. Why now has this train come to light? Is it true or a Hoax?
