The teaching centre of the Dominican Sisters of Saint Catherine of Siena is home to an exclusively Congolese congregation. About fifty nuns live here. Located in Niangara on the Uele river the building is used by the congregation for various purposes and looking after the hen house working in the fields household maintenance and day-to-day running of the centre are part of the routine. In their free time the nuns play football teach in the nearby schools and give practical tips to young Congolese mothers.
