A young woman living with her parents and siblings on a remote farm in harsh picturesque northern Québec has three suitors: a steady and unimaginative farmer Eutrope the Americanized and wealthy Lorenzo who has sought his fortune in Boston and François Paradis a rough and virile logger who captures her heart despite the warnings of her parents and the village priest. For a year marked by seasonal change in an atmosphere charged with the strangeness of Indians and the demons of the woods we see Maria at work and prayer struggling with decisions choosing to stay in Canada in love with François seeking to change his rough behaviors and dealing with extraordinary loss.
