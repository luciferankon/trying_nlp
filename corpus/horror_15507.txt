She doesn't want to be a friend daughter or cheerleader anymore. She just wants to be a killer. And if she can get through just one more year of high school then Beverly can leave home for good and stop pretending that she's anything but a butcher. Anthony has nothing. He's a loser. A nobody. But he's got one more year to muster up the courage to tell Beverly that he loves her and he's determined to do it before they graduate and she leaves his life forever. After a senior year filled with drama confessions and decapitations the clock finally runs out on graduation day. As the diplomas get handed out the question still remains. Will the geek get the girl? Or will the girl slaughter everyone?
