On the 30th of September 2017 over 10.000 people gathered in central Gothenburg Sweden to protest against the march of the nazi group NMR the Nordic Resistance Movement. The nazis never made it to their starting point of the march when the protesters blocked the way into the city center. Instead the nazis got beaten up by cops and had to walk home defeated and humiliated. The people of Gothenburg showed them that nazis aren't welcome in this town.
