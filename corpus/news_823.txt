They may have screamed "ME!!!" while coming of age in the Sixties and Seventies but now the Boomers' present and future are more important than their storied past. Boomers are still relevant still powerful and continue to have impact. Their impact will continue to grow as they enter new stages of life. Their influence is being felt again and they are driving change.
