Thomas is French and has lived in New York for the last 6 years. Occasionally he feels homesick and reflects on his past and the culture he left behind. He decides to return to France with two American friends Andrée and Adel and help them discover his native region the North of France and Douai the city where he grew up. In Douai the celebration of "Gayant" ("Giant" in the regional dialect) takes place. During three days of festivities a family of giant puppets made of wicker parades in the streets of the city inspiring the awe of spectators. Thomas and his friends are astonished by the carnival the parade the enthusiasm of the crowd but also by the commitment of the "porteurs" the men who lift the giants. They perpetuate the tradition from generation to generation. Our two Americans admire the courage of these people who survived not only wars and military attacks but most recently the economic collapse. Our friends encounter one surprise after another and meet local figures who share the love of the region its dialect and culinary recipe. Thomas Andrée and Adel return to the US and remember the modesty of the participants during this exceptional event the devotion of the inhabitants of Douai towards their giants the excitement of parading with those puppets - which although made of wicker seem to come alive. Our friends feel renewed with the assurance that humanity is capable of ingenuity based on common cause and shared values.
