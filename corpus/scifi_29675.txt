Apparatspott - we will do this yesterday is the third feature film in Low German by the Sulingen "Filmemoker". In this episode a secret time tunnel - the Sulingen "Tiedr√∂hrn" (STR) - causes a commotion. During her presentation the town mayor is projected into the past and gets lost. The governmental organisation "B.I.S" (farmers in black) commissions captain Kork and his "Gadget Pot" team to embark on a rescue mission. Due to huge technical problems however the rescuers also vanish into past epochs. Here our heroes meet famous figures of the past and take advantage of the opportunity here and there to falsify history. Will the "Gadget Pot" team finally manage to rescue themselves and the local politician or is the assigned task too formidable this time for the part-time space travellers? Martin Hermann *1964 in Sulingen; autodidactic and artistic head of the "Filmemoker"; "Apparatspott - we will do this yesterday" was produced over a period of two-and-a-half years exclusively during spare time.
