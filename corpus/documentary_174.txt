The film is a sequel of 'About Neshka Robeva And Her Girls'. An attempt to analyze the process of creation (generally) through the dance miniatures created by the trainer and three of her competitors in modern and rhythmic gymnastics. The problems of creative compromise of the 'scissors' between author's imagination and audience's desires of the judges' criteria (no matter if they are called 'jury' or 'critics') are observed. The documentary depicts the process of creation of rhythm gymnastics trainer Neshka Robeva and her dance miniatures. The focus is on creating such a miniature from scratch - choosing the music dance moves choreographic concept. Alongside of this the dancers also grow and build a character on stage. Some of them break under the pressure despite their talent. Yet new ones are to come and here we have Bianka Panova a four-time world champion to be. Group choreography is another focus of the film. It's hard to convey the essence of artistic creation on the big screen yet when the three girls Bianka Lilly and Delyana are doing their winning miniatures we feel as if we are watching not sports but art happening before our eyes.
