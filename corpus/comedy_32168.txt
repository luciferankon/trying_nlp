Fukioka Haruhi is a normal teenager going into a school for the absurdly rich. Wandering into the high school's own host club - a group of young boys whose job it is to keep their female clients dazzled and charmed - Haruhi accidentally knocks over an expensive vase with no way to pay for it. The host club's Prince Suou Tamaki proposes that their new debtor make up for the vase by becominga host in their club. Things appear to be going quite well. The only problem of course is that Haruhi is unavoidably a girl. Haruhi the average teen is enrolled in the prestigious wealthy school Ouran High School. After causing financial damage to the host club (a group of high school boys that entertain it's school's females by having afternoon tea and chatting and whatnot) Haruhi is forced to join the host club but... The only issue is that Haruhi herself is a girl.
