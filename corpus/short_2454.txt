If you don't utilize CRM you lose everything. It's so difficult to keep up with people. Not only in your own company but everyone you're dealing with on a day to day basis. It's imperative said William "Brimstone" Kucmierowski President and Founder of Hound Comics a media company that not only publishes comics but also cookbooks TV programming and lots more. In my interview with Kucmierowski at the Small Business Expo in New York Kucmierowski schooled Castillo as to what CRM actually is. He explained that CRM puts all the people you deal with on a regular basis in one place so you can actually manage them. Kucmierowski has been a longtime avid CRM user. He was first a devotee of the desktop application ACT but now he's moved his CRM operations into the cloud. You have to keep on those contacts and constantly follow up as that's critical to the ultimate prize increased revenue said Kucmierowski. Luckily Hound Comics is growing strong so their biggest challenge is to simply maintain a great staff and continue to build in a strategic manner.
