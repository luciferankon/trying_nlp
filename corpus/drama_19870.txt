There is a place near old Londontown where seemingly "normal" people congregate to abandon their mundane lives and problems. They call it the House of Sin the man in charge is known only as "The Mage". No one knows who he is or where he came from nor do they care. In the House of Sin they are free to explore every desire perversion and emotion to be humiliated and dominated or to be the one cracking the whip to become someone or something else engaging in bizarre behavior that would not be at all acceptable in the "real world". Prepare to be shocked and even disgusted by what goes on behind these closed doors and to wonder if your neighbors and people you see on the street everyday might be searching for the same thing to pursue their wild fantasies unbridled by the rules of a "sane" society.
