In 1983 a group of 154 children aged 3 and 17 years old traveled alone to Montevideo in a flight coming from Europe. They were children of political exiles from Uruguay who were unable to come back to their own country; they sent their kids to know their relatives and home country. This well intentioned act with a political message involved will be helpful not only with human rights' fight and freedom but also it will affect children's life in relation to their identity development when a crowd received them singing together "your parents will come back". This movie is about six kids who have been trying to establish their identity until today already grown up; because they hadn't got a common childhood like any other kid; growing up in one place with their relatives and neighbors exile's children lived a life in retirement leaving behind everything they loved.
