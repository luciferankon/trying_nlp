Rain starts to pour on Rene's (Robert Arevalo) smooth and sunny life when he went to Tokyo for a business trip and met the love of his life a Japanese woman (Charo Santos) whose life was cut short after giving birth to her child Rene Gallardo Jr. (Jay Ilagan). On his most lonely flight back home together with little Rene he met Cielo Martinez (Pilar Pilapil) who offers to complete the jigsaw puzzle of his life. Will it really solve the puzzle or will the rain just pour even harder not only on Rene's life but even more to his wife Cielo and his presumed son Rene Gallardo Jr.
