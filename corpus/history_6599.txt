This drama unfolds a complex tale of Manasha's fight for her just place among the Gods and Goddesses - of Chand Sadagar's unflinching devotion to Shiva where he sacrifices his six sons but does not deviate from his faith in Shiva - of Usha's love for Aniruddha and the tale of being reborn as Behula and Lakhinder and finally Behula's extraordinary story of courage and conviction to bring Lakhinder back from the dead. Manasha wanted her place in heaven at par with other goddesses - to earn that she had to persuade Chand Sadagar to worship her but Chand was unwilling. Manasha killed six sons of Chand but even then Chand did not bow down. Lakhinder is Chand's seventh son and Behula was his daughter-in-law. Manasha promised that even Lakhinder would not survive and she kept her word. But Behula was unlike the other daughters-in-law of Chand. She refused to be a victim - a puppet on a string - her fate being decided by some strange ego / agenda of her father-in-law and some goddess. She claimed her right to happiness and went to extraordinary length to ensure that the feud between Manasha and Chand is resolved and her husband comes alive again and they lived happily ever after.
