Mandy and Tor Bailey have already beaten the odds. Doctors told them their conjoined twins Emma and Taylor wouldn't make it a week after they brought them home from the hospital; but the girls who share the same heart and liver are thriving at 17-months of age. This is a huge responsibility for any couple but for the Baileys it's just one more ball to juggle. Tor and Mandy must decide whether or not to surgically separate the girls and risk each receiving an artificial heart while also managing their start-up businesses three older children - and baby number six on the way!
