A drama set amid an earthquake in Bihar. Miss Renee (Khote) looks after the victims while her lover the businessman Sardar (Mohanned) wants to make money from the disaster. She comes under the spell of the blind itinerant Musafir (Dey in his usual persona) whose low opinion of the depravity of the wealthy provides the film's moral backbone. She eventually discovers that as a child she had been promised to Musafir but had been rejected by his family for being of a lower caste.
