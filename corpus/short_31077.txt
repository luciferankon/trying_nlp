Walking Dogs explores the daily routine of a young married female who has found contentment inhabiting the roles she has created for herself. The film challenges the notion that married life must be a monotonous existence - if one fully embraces certain routines and mental states one can derive a great deal of pleasure from his or her chosen way of life.
