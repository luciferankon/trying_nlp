The popular TCM franchise Friday Night Spotlight continues in May 2014 with an examination of the film industry in Australia where pioneering efforts in cinema began in the late 1800s and continues to flourish today. The festival concentrates on Australia's New Wave movement of the 1970s and '80s during which many strikingly photographed films focused on survival of one type or another amid harsh yet beautiful landscapes. The series is hosted by two-time OscarŽ-nominated Australian actress Jacki Weaver best known for her Academy AwardŽ-nominated performance in 2010's Animal Kingdom and her role in 2012's Silver Linings Playbook. Each Friday night Weaver will introduce the first three films from her native land.
