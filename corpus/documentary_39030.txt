During the 17th century the port of Campeche --a treasure-filled city facing the sea-- was continuously under attack by pirate ships. Today the state of Campeche continues to be an invaluable treasure chest of national and global heritage. This program provides a visual tour of this fascinating legacy: the ancient Maya city of Calakmul the wealth of flora and fauna found in the biosphere reserves as well as its own architectural trademark: the walled city of Campeche.
