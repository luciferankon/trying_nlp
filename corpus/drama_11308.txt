A counterfeit 1000 tomin bank note is passed in a bazaar. It passes through a broad cross-section of Iranian society stopping with a pickpocket a pomegranate seller an abortionist an estate sale a beggar a college student a wedding reception some musicians smuggling rings and some New Year's revelers. Most of them realize it is counterfeit but too late to take action.
