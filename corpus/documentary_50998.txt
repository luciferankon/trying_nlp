Women of Tibet: Gyalyum Chemo - The Great Mother recounts the compelling story of Dekyi Tsering the mother of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. Dekyi Tsering known by Tibetans as 'Gyalyum Chemo' or 'Great Mother' gave birth to 16 children three of whom were recognized as incarnate lamas. Weaving anecdotal threads and personal reflections from her children grandchildren and friends with never before seen photographs from their family collections and rare footage of Tibet the film offers an intimate glimpse into Tibet's first family and the woman who inspired them. His Holiness talks about how his mother helped shape the man he is today and the relationship between healthy family and healthy humanity and how it all begins with a mothers love. Dr. Marion Woodman (Addiction to Perfection) Alice Walker (The Color Purple) and Angeles Arrien (The Second Half of Life) link this uniquely Tibetan story to a much broader perspective of motherhood and how the Great Mother lives within each of us.
