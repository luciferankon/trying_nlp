The marital difficulties of four couples living in a southern California housing development become intertwined. Among the unhappy couples are ne'er-do-well Jerry Flagg and his long-suffering wife Isabelle flirtatious Leola Boone and her sadistic husband Troy hard working Herman Kreitzer and his understanding wife Betty and newlyweds Jean and David Martin. A college-educated newlywed couple David & Jean Martin (played by Jeffery Hunter & Patricia Owens) moves into a newly constructed suburban Los Angeles subdivision in the late 1950s. The David & Jean are invited to a cookout occurring that evening in the backyard of their new next door neighbors Herman & Betty Kreitzer (played by Pat Hingle & Barbara Rush). The Martins are introduced to other neighbors Jerry & Isabelle Flagg (played by Tony Randall & Sheree North) & Troy & Leola Boone (played by Cameron Mitchell & Joanne Woodward) at the cookout. The neighbors are contemporary 1950s married couples dealing with issues that suburbanites have dealt with for years. Alcoholism marital infidelity racism & religion are a few of the suburban issues dealt with during the film's 1 hour & 41 minute running time. No Down Payment is an interesting look at 1950s suburban life & issues.
