An excursion into the fields of awareness breath and gravity seen as a sequel to Gil de Kermadec's "The Ball and The Wall" as well as building on JÅ™rgen Leth's "Motion Picture." In "Before The Wall" the ball itself is mainly removed being more image or inspiration with the focus resting on the body and its intimate movement and balancing. The wall in this case serves as the interfacing of athletic and everyday living between the ready and the already. Computer technology has made it possible to make the sound of one ball struck the soundscape of the entire film (sounds played out by Lars Ulrich).
