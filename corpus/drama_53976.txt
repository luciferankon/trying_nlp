The film follows Haris a hip handsome Afghan-American artist who shows his work at a downtown Manhattan art gallery. His story explores the ramifications of leaving Afghanistan and living as a refugee in America. Haris seems to be an all-American guy except that he creates strange installations of hanging ropes and suffers from terrible visions- of himself as a child in Afghanistan in traditional dress of smoke and bombs of his dead parents and the Russian soldier who shot them during the Soviet invasion. Haris embarks on a journey through the world of Afghan-Americans to learn more about their culture and there he finds both humor and tragedy. He meets Sunny an Afghan immigrant hot dog vendor whose son is a would-be rapper among others and falls for Laila a fashion designer who still carries the expectations of her traditional parents.
