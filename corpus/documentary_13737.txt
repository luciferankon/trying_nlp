With a soundtrack built from live performances of its different characters "Más allá del flamenco {Beyond Flamenco}" is a journey across geographic and artistic boundaries of flamenco to find how contemporary this art form can be. After more than a decade of life visiting the best theatres in the world from Carnegie Hall in New York to Sydney Opera House through Tokyo Bunkamura or Singapore Esplanade with two million viewers worldwide Flamenco Festival has become the home for the best and forward- thinking flamenco. Sadler's Wells Theatre in London European dance mecca and international reference is preparing its annual season of flamenco one of the most anticipated by the public and critics. Flamenco Festival which celebrates ten years of its first landing in this theatre is now part of its life but it would still be an extraordinary event. Within the walls of Sadlers Wells the frontiers between tradition and avant-garde are diluted and disciplinary barriers are overcome: we live for a day with some of the most important artists of Flamenco and creators from various disciplines and backgrounds who share experiences with them. Farruquito Estrella Morente Tomatito Eva Yerbabuena Israel Galván Rocío Molina beside contemporary Swiss pianist based in New York Sylvie Courvoisier; dancers and B-boys Sébastien Ramirez (France) and Honji Wang (Germany) the choreographer Akram Khan (UK) and violinist Vladimir Dimitrenko (Moldova) are part among of this coral story about flamenco today. Artists but also critics programmers and the audience that coincide in these coordinates of time and space guide the viewer beyond stereotypes and conventions to show that although there are still challenges to be met flamenco is a living art evolving which is now at the level of any other artistic manifestation of the XXI century.
