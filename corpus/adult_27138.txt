Jon Dough buys a "magic" pill box from Sydney St. James which she claims can grant the new owner six wishes. She has long since used up all her wishes on material goods ... so she pawns it off on Dough for some dough. He doesn't believe her of course but is curious to put the box under his pillow and dream up something he might want. Now ... what might Dough wish for?
