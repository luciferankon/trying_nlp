Former heavyweight boxer Eric Esch more popularly known as Butterbean barreled into the national ring in the '90s like a 400-pound wrecking ball clad in American flag shorts. Now Butterbean is taking his hard-earned tough guy reputation to the streets of his hometown: he's been deputized by the Walker County Sheriff's office and he's on a one-man mission to bring back a sense of community safety no matter how many butts he has to kick.
