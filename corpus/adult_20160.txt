An advice columnist tries to help women who find themselves bound and gagged. One woman fell for the fake maintenance man trick another was captured by a burglar two women were robbed and bound in a store after hours a jogger was nabbed when she returned home from her morning run and three other women found themselves securely bound and gagged by ruthless criminals. Even the columnist is captured tied to a chair and silenced by a thick bandanna thrust between her teeth.
