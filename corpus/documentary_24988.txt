Pescenica is an old industrial suburb of Zagreb. As a satirical depiction of Croatia's recent politics it has been declared independent republic. What's it like there today? Over a year the film crew was combing streets avenues parks and backyards focusing on the lives of four Pescenica inhabitants: its self-proclaimed president a teacher in a Roma school a cleaning lady in a film distribution company and a young stage director. All that in order to portray Pescenopolis the film's protagonist that floats between mud and clouds.
