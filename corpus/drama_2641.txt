Young literature teacher starts at the evening school. Her students are people with various professions who wish to complete their education. They are grown-up with different characters with problems in both their personal and professional lives. In order to get to know them better she assigns a paper with topic 'The Kindest Person I Know'. What her students write is candid and comes from their hearts. The teacher probes deeply into their pain and concerns; she tries to understand and help her students. The things she learns about life give a new meaning to her moral criteria.
