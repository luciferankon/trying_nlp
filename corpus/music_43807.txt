Alexander Ekman is an internationally acclaimed choreographer recognized and sought-after for his unique ability to pair wit and playfulness. His multifaceted talent is not only reflected in the movement but also in the music light and set brought together in a beautiful and surprising way. He was nominated to the Zwaan award for 2010's most impressive dance production. His new full-length ballet A Swan Lake nominated for a 2015 Benois de la Danse takes a fresh look at Tchaikovsky's classic work. On stage we see The Norwegian National Ballet dressed in costumes by Danish fashion designer Henrik Vibskov.
