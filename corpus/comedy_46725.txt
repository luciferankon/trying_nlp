At the Modern Follies Theater strippers alternate with vaudeville comics. Guys in a nearby office figure out ways to get past their demanding boss Mr. Quigby to spend time at the theater. One is Joe who also plays the horses and who needs to help his shrill wife find a foreign chef to cook dinner that night for Quigby. Joe's stenographer finds a chef the dinner party proceeds; with his German telescope Joe can also watch the burlesque routines at the theater across the street. But what if his horse comes in?
