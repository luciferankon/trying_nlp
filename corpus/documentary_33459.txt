This documentary will follow the journey of the African American community and attempt to address the question when did it actually become cool to make yourself seem less smart for fame? There are several entertainers with college degrees who lack substance in their music and promote topics that are degrading to the African American community and women. Why not showcase your education and show the world that not all African Americans are ignorant? Are celebrities just playing along for the money and willing to jeopardize their integrity?
