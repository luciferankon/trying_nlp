Across the Line is an immersive virtual reality experience that places viewers in the shoes of a patient entering a health center for a safe and legal abortion. Combining real audio gathered at protests scripted scenes and documentary footage the film is a powerful hybrid documentary-fiction depiction of the toxic environment that many health care providers health center staff and patients must walk through to provide or access health care on a typical day. It was executive produced by Planned Parenthood Federation of America and co-created by Nonny de la Pe≈Ña of Emblematic Group and Brad Lichtenstein and Jeff Fitzsimmons from 371 Productions/Custom Reality Services. The filmmakers worked closely with health care providers and patients to understand their experiences and to ensure the film is accurate and authentic. By putting the audience on scene virtual reality offers a new and immersive experience that can help people better understand what thousands of women face when they seek health care. Across the Line is available on three platforms - HTC Vive ("walk around" experience) the Gear VR and Google Cardboard.
