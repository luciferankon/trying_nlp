A man sits in a wheelchair looking across the East River toward Manhattan; he's without motion or expression. A girl of about ten whose mother is fishing a few yards away walks over and stares at the man. Her mother takes her hand and walks her away from him but soon the girl is back. A ball an empty wine bottle and a hug help the girl come to terms with what happens next.
