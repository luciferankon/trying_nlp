THE CHARLES W. MORGAN tells the extraordinary story of America's last wooden whale ship and the incredible saga of the first global industry dominated by America. From her humble beginnings in New Bedford Massachusetts in the year 1841 we follow the adventures of the Morgan on 37 voyages around the world where this "Lucky Ship" survived freeze-ups in the Arctic attacks by south sea headhunters fire aboard ship and a host of other stories each of which had the potential to end the vessel's life. Yet 170 years later the Charles W. Morgan lives on after an extensive restoration project that leaves her poised to sail again.
