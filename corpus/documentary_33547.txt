'Revolution: The Legacy of the Sixties' is an exploration of the 1960s Western cultural revolution as it ushers in our contemporary society. 'Revolution' explores partly through interviews with many of its key instigators the ground breaking cultural and social transformation of the 1960s as we get to the root of what changed during that period and why. To what extent is our society and culture today a product of those changes? What does the 60s generation feel remains to be done today to complete the revolution 50 years on?
