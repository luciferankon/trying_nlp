Jeannie and Marc go the Santa Monica Pier to have a fun outing together. Jeannie is nervous as Marc has been distant and she is unsure of where they stand. She is trying to forget her worries and just focus on mending whatever might be wrong. She is distracted from the other couples at the pier and cannot help but compare her own relationship to these other ones. Jeannie and Marc wait in line for the carousel. Once on it everything seems swell- until it's not. Marc is becoming eerily distant and when he turns to Jeannie they are transported into another place. The carousel has brought Jeannie to a Tunnel of Love to show her how her relationship with Marc really is. It's been full of more bad times than good and moments that caused her insecurity. Does she really want to stay with him? When the carousel decides she has seen enough it releases her back to the pier. Marc is already off the ride. Did he see any of the memories? Jeannie walks over to him and turns back to look at the carousel. She receives a good memory of her and Marc. For her that is enough to take hold of Marc's hand and continue off with him.
