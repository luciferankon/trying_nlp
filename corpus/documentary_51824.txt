A Bundle of Sticks is a feature length documentary about the word 'faggot' and its impact on our children. The film investigates the relationship between anti-gay language and how a simple word has become a significant factor to an ever-increasing number of teen suicides and sexual bullying in this country. It explores how such words perpetuate hate and the question of its future. We believe the negative effect of words is most tragic when it affects our youth. This is a crucial topic not only to the gay community but to all those who believe in equality tolerance and acceptance.
