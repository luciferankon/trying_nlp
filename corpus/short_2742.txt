The son of an old farmer had just returned from the military school where he had been learning the tactics of war. He arrives home and is affectionately greeted by his parents. He meets the daughter of the general and immediately falls in love with her. The next scene shows the lovers roaming through the gardens and he learns for the first time that she returns his affection. The next evening as he meets the young lady at the rendezvous two burglars break open the general's safe. As they make their escape they are followed by the farmer's son who had heard the noise. The burglars escape but the young man is left with the booty which they had dropped. Soon the general who also has been disturbed from his slumbers arrives on the scene and finds the farmer's son in possession of the stolen goods. He is accused of the deed. The young man denies that he is guilty but offers no other explanations for his presence on the grounds. Fortunately he is cleared and his innocence is established by the fact that a hat belonging to one of the burglars is found. Explanations and apologies are then in order and the general gives his consent to the marriage of his daughter to the farmer's son.
