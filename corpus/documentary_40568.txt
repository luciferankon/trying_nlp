A visit with the principals of seven architectural practices at the sites of their best work in many parts of Germany. The eleven architects all born after World War II give insight into the situation of architecture and the architect in Germany today a country which played a key role in the advance of modernism. The consensus among the architects is hope for a future when architecture can regain the creative dynamism that prevailed in the 1920's the heyday of the Bauhaus. While the quality of today's work is extremely high the underlying ideas come largely from abroad. Technology is in the foreground at the universities at the expense of artistic experimentation. Consultants for the selection of architects for this film were Wilfried Wang director Deutsches Architektur Museum in Frankfurt; and Kenneth Frampton Ware Professor of Architecture at Columbia University.
