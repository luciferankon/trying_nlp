In March of 2010 the members of Soulive hauled their instruments through the doors of a newly-opened warehouse-turned-music venue in Brooklyn that they would call home for the next two weeks. Eric Krasno Alan Evans and Neal Evans called on a multitude of their closest friends and musical conspirators to join them over the next fortnight - creating an incredibly broad guest lineup that included some of the preeminent guitar virtuosos of our generations (Derek Trucks Warren Haynes Charlie Hunter) some of the biggest names in Hip Hop (Questlove Rahzel Talib Kweli) and some of the most inventive improvisational players in modern rock n' roll (Robert Randolph Raul Midon Marco Benevento Kofi & Oteil Burbridge). The Brooklyn Bowl quickly became the mecca for these distinct yet like-minded musicians where they returned night and after to witness the magic unfolding donning the dress code for good times (bowling shoes) and sharing famous Blue Ribbon fried chicken. The common thread that tied together all these disparate ingredients quickly became palpable - from the transcendental heartfelt improvisations onstage to the homey & playful atmosphere provided by the bowling alley the Soulive residency was like nothing that had come before. All of these diverse elements fused to ultimately bring the Soul to Brooklyn Bowl.
