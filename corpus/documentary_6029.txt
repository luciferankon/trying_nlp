In Haphazard evenings in fading presents Roque is the trigger for a search that his granddaughter -and also the narrator- undertakes. However it's not really the granddaughter who tells the story given that their relationship is somehow inexistent as there isn't a real kinship between her and the rest of the family members. The narrator then evolves into an imaginary granddaughter but in almost complete possession of the family's collective memories most of which have taken place in Baradero a small northern town in the province of Buenos Aires Argentina. Nevertheless her family is the only one that has moved out of Baradero to settle in the capital city which allows her to analyse her ascendants' avatars with some distance. The narrator will quickly realise that she does not remember her grandfather who despite spending every Sunday afternoon with the whole family is lost in the labyrinths of his ailment. Her urgency to recall him is the beginning of a quest that will include old photographs VHS tapes and conversations with other family members and that will conclude with a certainty that states that everyone has altered their memories -and consequently reconstructed the past- and that it's not only his grandfather who she doesn't remember but nothing at all. Haphazard evenings in fading presents thinks about the new ways of registering the world in comparison to those that belong to a few decades ago and analyses the correspondence between the vague memory that everyone has about the same event while highlighting the power that lies on each space that somehow limits the process of reminiscence. And finally -and in each frame- a constant outline of death in all of its senses.
