A girl is found dead and with an amputated breast on the shores of a tourist beach on the Catalan coast. The bust appears soon after on the work table of Judge Olvido. It seems as if someone would like to relate the fabulous heritage of Óscar Bassegoda of whom the judge is executor with a mysterious portrait of the deceased Nuria Bassegoda where she also appears with a severed breast. The old inspector Méndez then begins a laborious investigation that will take him from the slums of Barcelona to the richest areas of the city where he will have the opportunity to meet the attractive heiress Blanca Bassegoda.
