When Eagles Dare produced by Daniel van der Molen and Joseph Mainland is a documentary which follows the behind the scenes activity at South London football club Crystal Palace during their 2012/13 campaign. Molen Media were given access following the appointment of Ian Hollaway as first team manager in November 2012. It shows the journey of a dramatic season in which the Eagles secured promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs beating rivals Brighton over two legs in the semi-finals and then Watford in the final at Wembley.
