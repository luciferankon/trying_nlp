Brothers Derek and Brad White have decided to move to Los Angeles to become actors. What they don't know is that their deadbeat buddy from high school "Wood" plans to follow them to California and become their manager. Wood makes himself at home right away shacking up with Derek at his apartment. When Brad and Derek start dragging their feet on their pursuit of fame Wood gives them the kick start they desperately need--even though they don't want it.
