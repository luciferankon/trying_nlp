A long time ago a group of ninjas (Sasuke Saizou Seikai Tsuruhime Jiraiya) imprison Nurarihiyon and his band of Youkai. Many years later Modern-day Sasuke and Saizou accidentally release the Youkai from their imprisonment. Tsuruhime comes along and tells the Hapless duo of their lineage. The ancestors appear and give them their Doron Changers. Sasuke Saizou and Tsuruhime then go to find the last two descendants (Modern-day Seikai and Jiraiya).
