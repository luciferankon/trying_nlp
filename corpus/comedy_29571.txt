A prominent businessman is found murdered on a Mississippi River riverboat in 1852. It's up to the passengers to find out whodunit before they reach their next stop in Memphis where the perpetrator will surely get away undetected. Leading the investigation is a young Mark Twain aided by several other actual historical figures from the time period including pre-teen momma's boy Sigmund Freud.
