Comedian Joe Pasquale attempts to survive alone in Guyana's vast rainforest. It's the wet season and torrential rains make survival difficult as Joe struggles to make fire and find food. In 90 percent humidity and crushing heat Joe builds a shelter and chops down two massive palm trees in a bid to get to the edible palm hearts at very top. But when the palms get trapped high up in the jungle canopy Joe is reduced to eating maggots. After days of starvation rations and losing his way in the jungle Joe finally finds food. After surviving 6 days alone Joe tears down camp and prepares to head back to civilization. He reflects that the experience is the most difficult thing he's ever done but acknowledges that to survive alone in the wild mental determination is even more important than physical endurance.
