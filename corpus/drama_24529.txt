Gangacharan is the new Brahmin of a village where he assumes various duties: teaching organizing religious events and trying to prevent epidemics. But in that year 1943 war is raging (as reminded by the planes occasionally heard flying over the countryside) and a major famine is under way. As food shortages reach catastrophic proportions Gangacharan attempts to preserve his privileged situation while his generous wife Ananga conversely tries to help and support the community.
