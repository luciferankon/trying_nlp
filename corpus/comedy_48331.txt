The comedy web series 47 Secrets to A Younger You follows friends Julie Dooling (Laura Frenzer) and Karma Kaufman-Castro (Rohana Kenin) as they navigate Brooklyn balancing family work love and lice. In the six episodes of season one Julie's mantras move her further from inner peace and her daughter sabotages her dating life on social media; while Karma races against a work deadline in denial about her caffeine addiction and missed chances for connubial romance. Will friends and family support enable or undermine their efforts? Will they be able to ignore the realities of middle-age for much longer?
