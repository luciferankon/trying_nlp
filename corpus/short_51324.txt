A chef comes into the kitchen and throws a lot of rags on the floor: he then casts a spell over them and immediately they take the form of human beings and dance a wild saraband around the place. After performing many unique tricks they disappear into space and are replaced by a group of knives and forks pans kettles and spoons. These are all supplied with arms and legs and dance around the chef as he lies on the floor. Soon one of the knives and forks drawing near to his prostrate body proceed to cut him into many small pieces which are then placed in a pan to be made into a delicious stew.
