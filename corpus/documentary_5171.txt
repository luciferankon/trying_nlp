A fascinating documentary about an abandoned mountain town in the Campania region of Italy as told by its images and its relocated people. As a result of an earthquake in 1980 its people chose to relocate rather than rebuild and hence started a new town bearing the same name (without the vecchio which means old). However the old Romagnano carries the character of its ancestors and still stands among its breathtaking vista awaiting the day of its renaissance.
