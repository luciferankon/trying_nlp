Ivy has it all: her morning coffee her OCD relatively under control and a small but thriving business as the only Dominatrix in beautiful upstate New York. Unfortunately for Ivy news of a rival dungeon coming to town has thrown her OCD back into high gear and now she's losing clients. Can Ivy save her business overcome her fears and find true love? Probably.
