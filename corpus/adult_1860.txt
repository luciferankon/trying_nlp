It's an accepted fact that people who live at a marina are the loosest most immoral swingers to be found. And the most infamous marina of all lies on the coast of sunny California a stone's throw away from the mega-rich Beverly Hills scandalous Hollywood and the international airport...an ideal location for the promiscuous flight attendants poor little rich girls and struggling actresses to find love and lust. These are the reasons why star reporter Ace Woodward (Buck Adams) and his side kick Melanie Moans (Amber Lynn) have chosen the marina for their story on the Sex Life of the Free and Easy. As they get deeply involved in the pointed questions as whether flight attendants really screw passengers to join the "mile high club" whether bikini-clad nymphets really land parts by strolling on the beach past Hollywood moguls getting their summer tan and whether the marina heat really contributes to a high and more intense sex drive. Melanie and Ace find themselves unavoidably driven to release their pent-up tensions. They go out in the world of hot sun-baked bodies unbridled passions and sleek sailboats to find the "nuts and bolts" of their article. What they learn about the swinging single life on the water is what this story is about.
