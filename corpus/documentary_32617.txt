Evangelist Steve Miller orchestrates The National Oral History Project along with Historical Black Colleges & Universities in an endeavor that uses the power of spoken and documented words to heal and to create spiritual and social change. It seeks to do this by asking ordinary people of color to share personal stories of racial discrimination in an effort to be heard and then documenting them. Those stories will then be used to pursue personal and national healing amongst human relations as well as to create policy changes within the political environment and spiritual changes within the ecumenical one.
