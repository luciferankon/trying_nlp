A young man decides to join the army because he needs a job and he wants to make his mother happy. He becomes the drummer in the band. His everyday life is now a combination of military training and music. What does the Argentine Army do these days 40 years after the dictatorship? How is a soldier made in a country without wars? Following orders rehearsing snappy marches and running through more drills than you can shake a drum stick at. A 19-year-old Argentinian man goes off into the army where he becomes a drummer in a military band. A measured but poignant study of the collision between young individuality and military uniformity which expands on the contradictions and uncertainties of entering into adulthood within the constraints of a rigid hierarchy. A coming-of-age story set in a "total institution".
