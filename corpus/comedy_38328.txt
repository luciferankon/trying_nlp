Is having fun and saying what you really think politically incorrect? Or is it impossible to do both? Cody McKenzie thinks nobody has parties anymore. Maybe they do but he just isn't invited to any. However tonight Cody and his wife Judy are going to a very special party. Elizabeth Sheridan star of Cody's fantasies is giving it for the engagement of his best friend. Elizabeth also happens to be a very important player where Cody works. Judy sees the party as a chance for Cody to advance; he sees it as a chance to impress the woman of his dreams. The fact that he bungles it horribly is perfectly natural. He couldn't do it any other way. The guests are all impossibly proper - preppies yuppies culturally elite - which are simply trendy labels for snobbish bores. His reputation precedes him and once Cody arrives he trips all over it. The harder he tries to be one of them the more he fails. From his first bizarre comment to his outrageous exit Cody alienates almost every guest disrupts the party and turns it into chaos. ...and there's a love story in here somewhere as well.
