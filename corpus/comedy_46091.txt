Sunset Bakery is a warm and affectionate comedy with the emotional depth of a drama. On one level it's a comic "fish-out-of-water" tale that follows the emotional journey of a hotshot real estate developer who's inherited a bakery he doesn't care for in a city he despises (Miami) and is trying desperately to sell it and leave town. On a deeper level it's a film about struggling and finally finding a place to call home.
