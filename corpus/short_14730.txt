Visiting her father's office in company with her mother Mrs. Marshall the little girl is permitted to stay while her mother does some shopping. She soon finds her way into the vault where the many files and other papers gain her attention. When later Mr. Marshall receives an urgent call to attend to some important business he hurriedly locks the vault forgetting entirely the child's presence and rushes away entirely absorbed by his struggle for the almighty dollar. When late in the evening he reaches home happy and joyful over the success of a well handled business transaction he finds his entire household almost distracted over the absence of the child. Like a flash it comes over him that his child must be in the vault and that unless rescued at once she will suffocate if she has not already succumbed. Their auto is put into service and all speed limit laws disregarded barriers are ruthlessly put aside at a great risk to themselves and any other unsuspecting chauffeur that might pass over the same route. When finally they arrive at the office building they find this in flames and the volume of smoke so dense that it is impossible to enter. Almost bereft of reason they return home where they find the little one tucked away in her crib by her nurse. How the child was rescued and returned to the home and what started the fire is given in a vision effect that lends much interest to the film.
