The movie is based on Matei Visniec's play "Teeth". The main theme of the movie is the redemption of the characters throughout harsh times. During any war their job is a very profitable one however it is not one for the faint-hearted and not in line with most moral values. The characters prove that even in the hardest of times they can become human or hold on to whatever humanity they have left. Final target being total absolution.
