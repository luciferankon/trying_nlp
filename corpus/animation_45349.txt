Fictionalized account of how Clement C. Moore came to write "A Visit from St. Nicholas" in which his young daughter stricken with pneumonia asks for a Santa Claus story for Christmas. No such story had been written so Moore writes his famous poem set to Ken Darby's musical version and sung by The Norman Luboff Choir.
