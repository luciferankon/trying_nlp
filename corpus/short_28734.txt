Over the course of five movements we follow two dancers as they explore the architecture and spirit of the abandoned Leonard Hotel in Butte Montana. Built during the height of the copper mining industry in the late nineteenth century the decaying space is channeled to us through the alchemy of dancer camera and editor. The sections unfold in such a way that you might even feel that there is a narrative living within the film but like the act of imagining the ghosts of the past this is an intriguing but hard to catch sensation. The film is a portal therefore not only into this evocative space but also the viewer's imagination; part reality part poetry.
