Yoko Ono fixed a camera pointing downward to a weather balloon and released it. As the balloon begins its ascent we see Ono and husband John Lennon sitting on a Central Park bench. Several minutes into the film the balloon enters a bank of clouds eradicating the image for several more minutes when it emerges from the clouds the view from above them is spectacular. This single-reel movie ends at the point when the camera ran out of film.
