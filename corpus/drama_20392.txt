Poor Linnie ( Mildred Harris ) lives a dreary life with her paralytic father and outspoken brother. Working as a shop girl she one day catches the eye of her employers son Preston ( Kenneth Harlan ) who decides he would like to brighten her life. For the next six evenings all of Linnie's dreams come true dining out motoring and enjoying the theater. However her brother discovers them at his house on their last evening out and the disgraced Linnie throws herself under Preston's car rather than face the humiliation of a scandal.
