In a Proven√ßal village two jolly good fellows Boule and Pons decide to dress as Saint Anthony and Saint Nicholas for the distribution of presents to the children on the feast of Saint Nicholas. They unfortunately get killed by a cart and find themselves in Hell where Lucifer and his demons duly torment them. They are saved by a prayer which helps them to climb the stairway to Paradise. Saint Peter taken in by the applicants' disguise lets them in. When the two true Saints show up trouble follows. Luckily thanks to the intervention of the Virgin Mary the two friends are acquitted at their celestial trial and allowed to return to Earth.
