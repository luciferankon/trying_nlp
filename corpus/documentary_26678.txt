There is a valley in Africa forgotten in time and so remote and isolated that even nature does not follow its usual pattern here. Flooded by summer rain its fertile plains turn to dust and burn to a crisp in the dry season; the Luangwa River becomes a slender lifeline for the wildlife that must drink from its banks. This is the arena of the crafty Yellow Baboon. This is a unique documentary about a large family of yellow baboons set against the every day perils of life beside a shrinking watering hole. African wildlife does not get harsher or more cruel than this when the extreme seasons reduce the Luangwa River to a trickle and each animal is in fear of its life. Whilst the land is ravaged by drought in an unforgiving dry season the baboons are resourceful very crafty and good at finding food. Their lives are finely tuned to the existence of other wildlife mainly the herds of elephants and impala but also the solitary leopards stalking the grasslands and watering holes. The baboons' most powerful enemy is the lion but their real nemesis is the sleek silent stalking leopard their most feared enemy by far.
