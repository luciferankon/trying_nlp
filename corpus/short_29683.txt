Filatelista is an experimental film that examines memory loss and identity to create a lyrical meditation on the complex relationship with our childhood. Using layers of images music and non-justified sounds the film poses the question - can we fully let go of our past or will we be haunted by it forever searching for an understanding of who and why we are?
