A scientist looking to slow aging gets into a bit of trouble by supplying drugs to a seedy drug dealer. And drug dealers take note - when your supply starts to run low never let your scientist connection just "whip something up" for you in a pinch. You just never know what you'll get as they say. Such is the case with small time hustler Bob and his crony Red. After Red gets taken for a quart of whatever the hell concoction scientist guy whipped up for them by party girl Leece she and her roommates Brandy and Carla find that after a night of partying the stuff grows - quickly. Meanwhile tensions between Bob and Red grow people die things get weird and shit as they say hits the fan.
