Film is about a Japanese geek (or an overly obsessed fan-boy/fan-girl) known as "OTAKU" named Hidetake. He thinks he is a reincarnation of Alfred Hitchcock. Hidetake also believes in himself that he is a well known filmmaker as well as Steven Spilberg. However an encounter with one woman drives Hidetake crazy. Because she was exactly like his mother.
