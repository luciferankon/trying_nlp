What do a handicapped garbage man a creep with a dildo strapped to his head an effeminate roller-skater in an age-inappropriate pink half-shirt and a ski-mask-wearing criminal driving a windowless white van have in common? Answer: women love them! Led by a mysterious steely-eyed guru (world-famous author and rock journalist Neil Strauss) two Hollywood roommates (television's David Faustino and Corin Nemec) navigate the shark infested waters of modern dating the only way two red-blooded American hipsters know how: by competing in high-stakes death-defying stunts of fantastical foolishness and daring all to win the hearts minds and phone numbers of the most pursued young women in LA. Who will man-up and who will be castrated (literally)? Tune in to the next gripping dastardly tantalizing episode of "Rules of the Game" and find out. But first forget everything you thought you knew about dating. Because as Dave and Corin will consistently prove you're just dead wrong.
