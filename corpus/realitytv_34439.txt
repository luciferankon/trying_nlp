A small number of men and women are stranded on two islands in the South Pacific. They must build their own shelter but food and supplies are provided. Each week a new person arrives and spends three days on each island. On the seventh day they must choose which island they prefer to live on for the rest of the game. At the end of the contest the island with the most inhabitants wins a cash prize.
