A young priest is sent by his bishop deep into the seacoast wilds of British Columbia to a parish of Kwakiutl Native Americans called Kingcome. The Tsawataineuk live in an inlet village and take their sustenance from the sea and from the forest. The bishop has not told him this but the priest has only two years left to live. Among these vanishing Indians Mark Brian learns enough of the meaning of life not to fear death. Through is faith and humanity he becomes part of the village of the Indians themselves and witness to their rituals and beliefs and the gradual destruction of a culture. Then on a cold winter evening when he hears the owl in the forest call his name he understands what is going to happen.
