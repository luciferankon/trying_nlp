The New York Times describes this documentary as "the science of contortion and. . . the performers who've made their livelihood twisting their bodies in amazing ways. Viewers meet Undarma the only contortionist to have her own Las Vegas show; Lars Houga a German performer who feels that sexuality is an intricate part of his art; Daniel Brown who performs with Jim Rose's Circus sideshow; and a young girl named Sonya who's just beginning her training as a contortionist." The program also features interviews with psychologist Cheryl Arutt Psy.D. who explores psychological issues that both attract and repel people to contortionism and a physician who reveal the special medical problems the art of contortionism sometimes causes.
