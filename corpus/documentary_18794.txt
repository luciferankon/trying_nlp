Madonna is one of the most successful female recording artists of all time. Her recent tour grossed nearly $200m a record for a female artist. How did she get from small time dancer to international icon and slavishly imitated role model? Who helped her along the way? Who did she use and who used her? Where the storms of outrage over her sexuality and attacks on the church reactions to her heartfelt beliefs or carefully contrived publicity stunts? Using interviews from those who have closely followed her career on both sides of the Atlantic and a mass of the star herself we tell the unauthorized story of this wild angel who turned herself the Queen of Pop.
