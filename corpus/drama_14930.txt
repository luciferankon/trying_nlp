When an assisted living home in California shut down many of its senior residents were left behind with nowhere to go. The staff at the Valley Springs Manor left when they stopped getting paid - except for cook Maurice Rowland and Miguel Alvarez the janitor. "If we left they wouldn't have nobody" the 34-year-old Alvarez said. Their roles quickly transformed for the elderly residents who needed round-the-clock care. Overwhelmed Maurice and Miguel were in over there heads. With medication foul-ups and residents becoming ill They called 911 several times over the course of several days before emergency responders finally evacuated the last of the residents by ambulance. Their heroic ordeal led to the Residential Care for the Elderly Reform Act of 2014.
