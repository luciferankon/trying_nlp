A 53-minute documentary film in English takes the viewer back to a seemingly distant yet uncannily familiar time when men and women grappled with an enemy larger than fear itself. This never-before-told (and shown) documentary feature film is about the retaking of The Rock by a few brave men captured in their own time and places. As a backgrounder it came as a shock to the United States that an island fortress as well-armed as Corregidor would end up in Japanese hands before mid 1942. And three years later it was equally a shock to the Japanese holders of the fortress in the mouth of Manila Bay that a handful of American paratroopers would retake it in two weeks' time. This video gives eyewitness accounts from both sides of the action. Defenders and a few brave men coming down onto Corregidor from the air (which the Japanese commander on The Rock had said would not happen because it could not) with a few pounds of equipment and a lot of guts and determination-well that pretty much signaled the end for Japan.
