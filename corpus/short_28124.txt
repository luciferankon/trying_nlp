PATV partnered with global film competition 48 Hour Film Project. The challenge to talented young filmmaking teams was to make a short film in just 48hours. We gave them three essential elements to include - a Pepsi can a line of dialogue of "Don't Hesitate" and the character of a singer. Check out the films here.
