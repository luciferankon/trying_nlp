Is perfection real or is it an abstract concept unattainable in life? A fetishist sees the perfect pair of feet and goes to great lengths to meet them (and the woman to whom they're attached). He talks it over with his shrink (an axilla fetishist) sees the mystery woman remove her shoes at a Japanese restaurant (he sneaks over to her shoes and traces the sole of one in order to buy her a pair that will fit) and follows her shoe box in hand until the right moment. Meanwhile we learn something about her own fetish when she sneaks into a hospital and puts on a nurse's outfit. When the moment of their meeting is at hand will she accept his gift?
