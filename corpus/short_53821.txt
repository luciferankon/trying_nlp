On March 22nd 2016 Brussels was shook by three coordinated suicide bombings. This was the city's response - one of love and union. After hearing of close friend Andrei fleeing Brussels in the wake of the devastating terrorist attacks on March 22nd Sam Holding felt compelled to make a film about the city's response to such an atrocity. The overwhelming sense of peace and unity took the film in a direction we could never have predicted. The combination of the city's inspiring beauty and its citizens' resilience lead us to find our message: 'L'Union fait la force' (Unity makes strength).
