It's not a mystery that intolerance BREEDS insecurity. This short film is a real story -- perhaps mine perhaps the one of someone close to me -- told through the voice of another. The thoughts of a man so ashamed and frustrated with an integral part of his makeup -- his sexuality -- that he isn't willing to face the camera and tell it himself. We've apparently come so far... yet not if you're too lazy to walk.
