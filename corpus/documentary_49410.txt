A young German author impressed by photographs of a Czech photographer goes with his friend's recommendation to visit him. She was welcomed with a combination of the worst rude words. So it all began. This is a film about an old man with no needs and a remarkable past facing the hype as an artist against his will. There isn't any important city in the world where his unusual work hasn't been exhibited. In this very moment some of the leading metropolis' galleries are exhibiting for amazed visitors the photographs taken with the strangest camera ever made. But while in the art circles worldwide his photos cost up to 12 000 Euros Miroslav Tichý lives alone in an old waste house isolated from the world surrounded with only a few friends. "They should have come earlier now it's too late." - he said refusing to talk about the fame. The German director Natasa von Kopp discovers for us the new "Tichý Ocean" in the middle of Europe in the beginning of 21st century. And this film's discovery is as amazing and thrilling as the great discoveries of new seas and continents.
