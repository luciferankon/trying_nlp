FEEDING OBESITY is a documentary that looks at the obesity epidemic through the experience of four obese individuals. Each of them want to change their life none have been able to so far. Feeding Obesity offers help - not only to the four participants but to anyone who is mired in the trap of obesity. We learn that dieting is actually the enemy and eating is truly the only way to succeed. We learn that food addictions are real but they can be overcome. We learn that exercise is helpful but not the answer to weight loss. And we learn that all of us are better when we become honest with ourselves and learn to look to others for support. Finally we discover that it comes down to ME. The obesity epidemic can only be defeated when each of us takes a personal stand making choices that promote health regardless of the cultural political and financial factors contributing to the epidemic.
