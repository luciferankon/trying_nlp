Tragedy strikes each generation of an extremely unlucky family. First a father of four is killed by his second son who is then given the death penalty. The eldest son is killed in a battle against Japanese soldiers. The third son becomes a policeman but is killed by communist sympathisers. The fourth son kills himself during the student revolution of 1960 and his son is imprisoned in the military coup the following year.
