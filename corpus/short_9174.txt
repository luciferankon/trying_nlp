Hands of The Carpenter (Hands) is a faith-based non-profit community passionate about serving an often overlooked group - single mother families and widows in need. Hands provides automobile repair and maintenance; enabling them to maintain a job get children to school and to keep medical appointments. Hands invited Denver-based filmmaker Patrick Sheridan to visit with them and some of the women Hands serves and asked Patrick and his team to make whatever movie they felt inspired to make. "50: The Hands of the Carpenter Story" is the result. For each woman Hands serves the need for automobile repair is immediate. Without it she can lose her job. Without a job she can lose her home. And suddenly a seemingly simple repair can lead to homelessness. Hands operates alongside Hands Automotive in a social enterprise environment to provide sustainability. Hands Automotive is a full-service repair facility - open to the public - that uses all of the resources it generates to further support the women Hands serves.
