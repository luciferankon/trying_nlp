DIRTBAGS is a road trip sex comedy set against the backdrop of a slasher movie. Joe Dale and Jamie are three misfit buddies ready to drink smoke and screw all weekend long at their favorite lake house vacation spot where their girlfriends await. Dale documents the road trip with the new camera he purchased after his girlfriend Hailey gave him the green light to record a sex tape over the weekend. Joe doesn't mind having the camera around as it can immortalize the moment he proposes to his own girlfriend Kelly. Jamie doesn't like the revelation that Joe plans on proposing but Jamie doesn't really like anything. Jamie is abrasive and coming off a bad breakup which is why he is being set up with Hailey's sister for the weekend. During the trip the three immature friends realize they're finally growing up albeit about 10 years later than most respectable people. This is likely the last time they'll truly hang out together and with radio reports of a serial killer on the loose it might be the last time they see each other ever again! The three men learn that getting older and growing up aren't exactly the same thing. The fun is over. The rest of their lives will now be spent in true adulthood. Unfortunately the rest of their lives would only last about 8 hours as they'd be killed later that night.
