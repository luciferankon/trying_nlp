The "Ahaztutako Garaiak - Forgotten Times" documentary shows the diversity and complexity of the past and present of Basque migration and the return to Euskadi through the testimonies of 24 people who take us into landscapes of other times of memories or forgotten moments. Children of war exiles shepherds cane cutters priests or Jai Alai players whose life paths led them to many different countries give us first- person accounts of their experiences abroad and the later return to Euskadi.
