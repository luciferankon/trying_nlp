Middle-aged couple look at TV at night. One has his chair closer to screen. In silence a group of men enters the place seizes the woman in the back chair gags her swings her measures her and puts her back in her chair before leaving. She can't say a thing about what her husband has not perceived and goes to bed. The husband left alone suddenly endures the same treatment. Left alone in his chair he turns off the Tv set and goes to bed. Husband and wife side by side just say goodnight to each other and turn off the light. Elsewhere the group of men reports to their chief which notes the total measured for the night and punctuates by "Nice work boys !". "Thank you boss" is their answer. As the title says "you do not tell everything between spouses". A delight to discover when not warned.
