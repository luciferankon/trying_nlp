As we begin a man with a lost soul reflects on his lost life. It's Christmas Eve and he is all alone. While traveling home in a heavy snow storm he comes across a situation that leads him into doing a selfless act. When he awakes Christmas Morning he is visited by someone who will change his life forever.
