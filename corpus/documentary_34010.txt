Cedo is a documentary film about Cedo Saraba a man pushed off the stage the likes of whom we see daily in streets parks and trams collecting plastic bottles and scrounging money. Cedo is 45. He is homeless alcoholic and drug addict with no legal income. His mother is a Croat and his father is a Montenegrin. Cedo's parents moved to Zagreb in the 1950s: mother came from Croatian Podravina and father came from Bosnia. Cedo was born in 1965 (he was named after his father's brother). His mother worked as bookbinder. She also cleaned houses of wealthy citizens. Father was a machinist but he never really worked: he was a bum alcoholic and womanizer. Besides Cedo he had at least five more children. He never recognized them because they were all born out of wedlock. He only recognized Cedo (who has his family name) and his stepsister who lives in Switzerland. He lost his life in a bizarre accident: while jumping off a train he ran into a lamp post and died. At the time of his father's death Cedo was 16 months old and his troubles were yet to begin. At the age of 12 he started to drink. At 16 he was diagnosed with alcoholism. Although a Catholic baptized by Franciscan monks he and his mother were harassed because of their family name in the 1990s. Cedo's first name was not very popular either. The 1990s also saw him becoming addicted to heroin. Cedo Saraba and a few of his mates agreed to tell their life stories.
