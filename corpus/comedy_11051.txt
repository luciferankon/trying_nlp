Anna is stuck: she's approaching 30 living like a hermit in her mum's garden shed and wondering why the suffragettes ever bothered. She spends her days making videos using her thumbs as actors - thumbs that bicker about things like whether Yogi Bear is a moral or existential nihilist. But Anna doesn't show these videos to anyone and no one knows what they are for. A week before her birthday her Mum serves her an ultimatum - she needs to move out of the shed get a haircut that doesn't put her gender in question and stop dressing like a homeless teenager. Naturally Anna tells her Mum to "back the f-off". However when her school friend comes to visit Anna's self-imposed isolation becomes impossible to maintain. Soon she is entangled with a troubled eight year old boy obsessed with Westerns and the local estate agent whose awkward interpersonal skills continually undermine his attempts to seduce her. Anna is deeply grieving the death of her twin brother and retreating into herself. It takes her mother's nagging her grandmother's wisdom Brendan's infatuation with her and a troubled little boy going through the same life-altering experience she did to get her out of the rut.
