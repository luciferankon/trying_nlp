The film was shot over a period of five years at the parish in a small village in the Tatra mountains in Slovakia. The local priest Marian Kuffa takes care of nearly 250 people. With them he talks on daily basis and works hard to make them understand that he is not just the one who preaches. The stories of homeless people alcoholics junkies and other misfits serve as a parallel to life faith and personal philosophy of Marian Kuffa. The revelation of the raw picture of the people Martin takes care of makes us understand the incredible power of his determination.
