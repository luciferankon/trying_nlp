Robert 40 years old lives in the city of Strasbourg but he seems to have some issues with Strasbourg's nightlife. In reaction he takes photos and videos of people leaving the bars or the nightclubs and he publishes their images on the Internet in order to denounce the night's 'noise pollution' of his city. Some people wants to have fun on the weekend; Robert wants to sleep well. A small film crew meets Robert in order to understand his approach.
