Like all institutions of the European East the Orthodox Christian Churches are doing their best to tackle the specter of transition. Priests and monks from Bulgaria are no exception: in the post-Communist times educated just as much as dedicated individuals are bringing new habits. Nowadays they work in hospitals cure drug addicts revive Byzantine architecture introduce catechism in schools and spread the word by publishing books. In a nutshell - trying to keep its flock together the Bulgarian Church is increasingly drawn to secular life. Set to investigate these issues two reporters from Serbia armed with a minuscule digital camera but huge enthusiasm develop deeply personal relationships with Bulgarian roads clergy architecture and cats. They conduct a dozen interviews with the people in robes all across Bulgaria from deep south of Kardzhali to northern border of Russe from the western capital Sofia to the eastern Black Sea port Varna. Priests are seen from their human side singing folk songs playing soccer and arguing how after all gluttony is not a mortal sin.
