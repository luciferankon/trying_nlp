Do not fear the death for it is nothing but awakening from a dream - said the dervish to the frightened man. Fear is opposite of love and love is God. Three angels protect us while we dream; they keep a record of our good and bad deeds. And when we shall awake from the dream and start living into death we will not speak but they will speak for us."
