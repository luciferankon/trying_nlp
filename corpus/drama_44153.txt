A murder a life threatening beating & a suicide three of The Island Apes don't make it all the way to the end for the final group decider against the Turks... A game the English have been banned from attending! A 1980's subplot runs through the film regarding a sister of one of the six receiving a horrendous kicking by a ruthless skinhead gang.
