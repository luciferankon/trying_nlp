The night Cherry Douglas comes home from foster care she is attacked by her ex- boyfriend. She finds herself on a journey to take back her life and find out what she's really made of. She goes to all the usual sources of guidance: a psychologist a minister and her school teachers. The psychologist tells her that she's a normal teenager and says that her questions about life and our suffering can only be answered by a priest. The minister can only offer advice and enigmatic riddles to help her find her answers which eventually leave her to the desire to find the truth about God himself. Her school teacher prattles on about social groups and how you just have to allow yourself to go with the flow to fit in. None of these sources seem to answer her questions or save her from the cruelties of her peers. Sleepless nights and stressful school situations leave her lost. Until she finally approaches the blind man who took the time to call the police when she was in trouble. She joins her friends in martial arts classes which start to help her build her self esteem. Between the spiritual guidance of the reverend blinded in a church fire and her martial arts instructor's gift of discipline she begins to see her relationships for what they are. She realizes who she wants to be and how to be that while being successful in the world around her. She abandons those relationships that only limit her and begins to reach out to those who may truly care. She learns what the words love and loyalty mean and finds her way into college.
