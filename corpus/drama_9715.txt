One Rupee Film is actually a 90-minute long docu-diction about independent film-making in India. The story goes like this that a group of youngsters get involved with film-making in a manner theatre and Little Magazines are formed just for the sake of making films. The film starts at a point where they are going through some kind of crisis one is a crisis of identity since they have hardly ever seen the large equipment essential for making films; secondly an economic crisis getting access to the minimum cost of making a film. Both these are dependent on each other that is if one is resolved the other will resolve on its own. Under such circumstances one of them decide to stop despairing and vows to make a full-length feature film at any cost. Here the journey begins from prospective financiers to the concept of films made outside the industry by common people. Each interaction gives form to imagination on the young man's part thus creating the fiction segments about how he would portray these interactions in his own film. But his own film isn't happening because he doesn't have the funds. Yet he witnesses films made in Mumbai worth 3 crore or 10 crore or even more are getting tagged 'independent'. He witnesses victory marches for apolitical films at a time the country is in the grip of an intraneous war. All that he sees have inwardly began to make him restless unstable impatient. He vows to make his film happen even if it means saving every single rupee he gets little by little.
