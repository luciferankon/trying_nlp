This documentary filmed entirely by military photographers recounts the U.S. Navy's 1946-47 expedition to Antarctica known as Operation High Jump. The expedition was under the overall command of Admiral 'Richard E. Byrd' (qv) no stranger to the Antarctic. This was a large undertaking involving 13 ships and over 4000 thousand men. The fleet departed from Norfolk Virginia traveling through the Panama Canal and then southward to their final destination. The trip through the ice pack was fraught with danger and forced the submarine that was part of the fleet to withdraw. The trip was a success meeting all of its scientific goals. The film is narrated by three Hollywood stars all of whom served in the US Navy: 'Robert Taylor (I)' (qv) 'Robert Montgomery (I)' (qv) and 'Van Heflin (I)' (qv). This film documents the largest expedition ever undertaken to explore Antarctica. The expedition code named "Operation High Jump" was made by the U.S. Navy and involved 13 ships (including one submarine) 23 aircraft and about 4700 men. The film was shot by photographers from all branches of the U.S. military. One purpose of the expedition was to explore and photograph several thousand square miles of inland and coastal areas that had not been previously mapped. Additionally military planners wanted to evaluate whether military troops could successfully perform against an adversary in such an environment.
