This school bus safety film follows the last bus rides given by two of the safest bus drivers Wally Vega and Emma Hammer. Their deaths were not attributed to any carelessness on their part but to the rowdy school children that they drive. Distrubances ranging from knife fighting smoking and drug use to dogs and mice being let loose on the bus.
