Mandi Clark and Garfield: Three roommates who never got the opportunity to tune out the motivational speech at high school graduation. These three degenerates strive for a better tomorrow by finding new ways to get back into the bar they have been 86'd from multiple times and fusing many wonderful things together to make one shitty thing... like beer and cheerios. Short on rent and long on fails these three will make even the most pathetic sad sack of our generation feel better about his or herself.
