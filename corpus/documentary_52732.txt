Nadiya Hussain visits her family village near Sylhet in the north east of the Bangladesh. Using local produce and techniques she shares her favourite recipes including baked fish with green mango chutney and a halva called thoosha shinni. As she cooks she reveals the roots of Bangladeshi cuisine. When she is invited to a relative's wedding Nadiya decides to bake a three-tiered pumpkin celebration cake for the bride. It is a decision she may have thought twice about if she had realised the only available oven would be in an industrial bakery. This trip is also a chance to reconnect with family Nadiya has not seen since her own arranged marriage over ten years ago and it proves to be a moving trip down memory lane.
