Humans are the only species capable of imagining the future while at the same time ignoring the consequences of the future we are creating. Breath of Life reveals why we modern humans are in denial about catastrophes of our own making that could come to pass sooner than we think. Filmed in Europe Scandinavia North America and Hawaii the film features breathtaking cinematography and insightful commentary from the world's greatest evolutionary biologists and psychologists - but it is the common sense of farmers in the drought stricken western United States and the wisdom of Hawaiians from the most isolated place on the planet that show us the way back to a more honest and authentic relationship with the world and reality.
