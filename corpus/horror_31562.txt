Hailed as having "the most WTF moments in movie history" Antfarm Dickhole is the story of rampaging army ants that have nested inside a living human body. The unwilling host discovers that when bullies attack him the ants defend their nest. Thus begins a tragic tale of what happens when the powerless become powerful. To be honest Ant-Drew and his best friend Ant-Thony are not exactly hero material. As a matter of fact they are quite the opposite as they are constantly bullied any way possible when all the two friends want is to relax and enjoy a good talk while in nature. Surely this is not much to ask however bullies are everywhere. During one unfortunate incident the two buddies will be beaten badly deep in the woods next to an ant colony and as a result an improbable yet miraculous symbiosis will begin. Now Ant-Drew will never need to fear again as the miniature army in his pants is simply unstoppable thirsting for revenge.
