Victor is a failure; a poor barber who has come to despise poverty with a vengeance. There had to be a way to make a big score and live to enjoy it. Fate intervenes when Victor's new landlady Thelma turns out to be a rich old widow. Victor wastes no time in charming the old girl and they fall madly in love. The only thing crimping Victor's style is Betty a sweet young nurse. Though Victor is torn between the beautiful young nurse and the beautiful old money he can only have one. Of course there's Don an alcoholic extortionist and Victor's best friend who thinks it's a great idea for Victor to marry the old girl. He generously offers to help - for a piece of the action. Disaster strikes when Thelma's niece Lucy shows up. She's determined to break up the courtship - along with Victor's head. They'd all better get moving because the old lady's feeling under the weather - and there's a hurricane coming!
