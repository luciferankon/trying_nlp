The Chinatown in Milan is highly problematic recording several murders a year perpetrated with meat-axes in the streets by the light of the sun. When an Italian guy asks a Chinese girl's hand in marriage this triggers a domino-like plot of confrontations among a crowd of characters. Starting from the focus on one of the largest and oldest Chinatowns in Europe the film carries the spectators into a universal metaphor on hatred and dreams between West and China.
