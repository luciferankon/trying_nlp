This is the story of a number of old stores in modern-day Tel Aviv-Jaffa all small businesses 40 years old or older who have somehow survived despite the hardships of time. The film passes between the stores and unfolds an old and aging world of tradition and family businesses a whole fabric of life and places very different from the fast dynamic life that surrounds us. Among the participating shops: A barber shop about to close Mikolinsy shoes which was one of the city's most elegant shops and an Arab-owned pharmacy in Jaffa run by a father and his son.
