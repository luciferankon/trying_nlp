A film without words. A young woman dances in a field she projects innocence. More experienced women follow offering invitations of cigarettes and cocktails and then of sex. A man responds but is he a lover or a madman. In between this sporadic narrative a train arrives in New York City its skyline appears a ship leaves port while well-wishers wave goodbye and a boat's wake leaves a pattern in water. Near the end a woman draped in white muslin dances and swirls in a field her eyes closed. Leaves fall a woman walks a man seems to follow her. Women's invitations men's responses. Possibilities abound but not all are benign.
