3 friend's Eddie Kingi and Matthew get together in Auckland New Zealand and decide to take a trip down the line to Wellington in an old Mark ll. Unbeknown to his mates Kingi is really running away from some drug debts and the heavy's wanting their money follow them. A movie mainly for Kiwi's in the Once Were Warriors type mold of seeing a little bit of our own experiences and lifestyle. Sprinkled with humour low level violence and some harsh realities of life this movie is one for the whole family. I must of watched it at least 20 times or more before I reached the age of 12 lol.
