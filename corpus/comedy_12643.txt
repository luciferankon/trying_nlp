'STATH' (working title) is a brand new 6x30min sitcom for E4 written by and starring one of the UK's leading young character comedians JAMIE DEMETRIOU (Fleabag Paddington) - described by the Independent as 'a Steve Coogan in the making.' Main character Stath is a chaotic but well-meaning lettings agent working for his Greek-Cypriot father in North London. Across the series Stath tries to prove himself a worthy heir to the family business 'Michael and Eagle' despite his epic incompetence and divisive personality. Against the backdrop of London's crazy property market STATH is a highly original workplace comedy with family at its heart which offers a unique glimpse of Greek-Cypriot life in the city. The series is co-written by Robert Popper (Peep Show Friday Night Dinner) and directed by Tom Kingsley director Pls Like (BBC3) and BAFTA-nominated feature Black Pond.
