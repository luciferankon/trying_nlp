Verlin is 9 years old and does not talk nor does he even seem to hear. Henry a child-like adult befriends Verlin and pulls him from his shell. Verlin's mother mistrusts Henry who she feels is dangerous. Eventually Henry's family is convinced that he should be placed in an institution. Henry's sudden disappearance from Verlin's world drives him deeper into himself. It's 1935 in rural Opeongo County Ontario. Henry who still lives with his parents is a hulking man which belies his slow mental status more closely resembling that of a child in many respects. Although many in the county view Henry as harmless those who not support that view look to his association with such people as Elvin who believes angels live behind his eyes and one-legged Mabel who lives by her own code as confirmation that he is a menace. Nine year old Verlin is Henry's nephew the son of Henry's brother Ferris and Ferris' wife Minnie. Verlin does not speak nor does he seem responsive to human stimuli something that only occurred as he came out of infancy. It isn't until Henry starts spending time with Verlin that Verlin seems to become happy and respond to a human around him. However Minnie wants to believe that response is for her. She also does not not trust Henry who increasingly takes off with Verlin on their adventures without asking either her or Ferris. As such Minnie like many in the county want to see Henry institutionalized as she fears he could be a danger to Verlin. Caught in the middle is Ferris who like his and Henry's parents loves and inherently trust him but who wants to ensure Verlin's safety and happiness and wants to retain a supportive marriage with Minnie.
