Movie was conducted by interviewing 10 people who are talking about their coming out experience. Focus is on emotions these LGBT people had in their coming out process and on their friends who were their to support them. Fear anticipation rejection confusion hugs... are one of the feelings that will be shown in these interviews. These variety of feelings and emotions are giving the dynamic of entire project - amplified with effective short cuts and transitions. Some of them had a very simple even funny coming out story and experience while some of them faced a painful and very hurtful one. These confessions are unique stories but on other hand are filled with a lot of cliches that LGBT people are faced along the way. Their individual stands and opinions are at some points conflicting which makes the speakers confront their friends who are not present.
