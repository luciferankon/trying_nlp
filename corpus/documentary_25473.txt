The choreographer Maurice BÃ©jart is one of the brightest artists of the 20th Century. He revolutionized the art of Dance and conquered tens of thousands of spectators around the world many of which had been indifferent to Ballet up to then. His death last November 22nd is an irreparable loss for the world of the arts but above all it means a cataclysm for his own company. 40 brilliant dancers from all 5 continents are now left without their teacher and mentor and have to earn the company's survival.
