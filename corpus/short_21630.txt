To his friends eleventh grader Peter Miller likes to portray himself as the smooth confident ladies man who can get and bed any girl he wants before moving onto his next conquest. As a challenge his friends choose their high school colleague the virginal Nicky as his next conquest. Nicky initially is wary of Peter if only because she doesn't even know who he is when he telephones her for the first time. But as Peter eventually gets Nicky to go out with him he begins to really get to know her. Peter has to decide whether to go through with plan and risk hurting Nicky or ditch the plan and lose the bravado he's worked so hard to establish.
