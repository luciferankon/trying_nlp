It is nighttime. We are in northern of Iraq at Sulaimani city center. There is fire and Aram Ali a photographer is taking photos of it. There is a sound of an explosive by the fire. He delayed his action for a few minutes and then continued to take his photos. Aram's photos look more like portraits. He takes photos of special places.
