Throughout a year's work a group of ten actors and a film director will work together on the creation of the characters and on the structure of the plot of a new film to come. Long sessions of discussion rehearsals and endless repetitions serve to develop the most important scenes of that plot until it takes its ultimate form in the film which results from this work.
