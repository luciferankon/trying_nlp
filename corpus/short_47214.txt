The world collides in Chungking Mansions (Hong Kong). As perhaps the most diversely populated building on earth it is a paradise of multi-culturalism and low-end globalisation uniquely belonging to no one and everyone. For years the building has been notorious both as a refuge for petty criminals and illegal immigrants and for its unsanitary living conditions. Yet it exists as a perfect example of a city as an organic mega-structure flexible enough to fulfill every need from religion to water supply while providing an alternative to conventional space culture and time. What is fascinating here besides all the shortcomings is that Chungking somehow succeeds continuously evolving to accommodate the hopes of those that find themselves drawn there. My film Chungking Dream takes us into the heart of this Pandora's box isolating characters and scenes from the myriad of options that exist layer on layer in the building taking us into their most inner spaces and reflecting on a world in which we all have to fight for the space to live out our dreams.
