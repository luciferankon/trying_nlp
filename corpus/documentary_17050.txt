One Night in November follows professional paintball team Chicago Aftershock during the tumultuous 2011 season. Filmed over the course of 12 months and 7 professional events the film chronicles Aftershock's 20th year as a professional franchise from player departures coaching changes and all the highs and lows-from going winless on their home turf in Chicago to capturing the Gold in Las Vegas at the NPPL World Paintball Championships only to crumble and break up during 2012 pre-season.
