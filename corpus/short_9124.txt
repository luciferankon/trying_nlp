A vampire-like woman with deathly pale skin and jet-black eyeshadow harasses a deadpan young man wearing a straw hat and horn-rimmed eyeglasses continually asking him "Do you love me?". She sings the question out of tune over and over as she follows the man about. He never changes expression although he does hold up a little stick with the picture of a smiling toothy mouth which he puts over his own mouth as hysterical laughing plays in the background. Her question grows more frantic and desperate and pleading as she dances about him tackles him and presses her face to his through the bars of a gate. She manipulates his face which remains expressionless. Finally she grabs him by the throat and shakes him repeatedly as he succumbs.
