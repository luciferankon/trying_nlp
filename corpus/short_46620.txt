Applies the technology of high-speed HD video toward capturing scenes and subject matter reminiscent of the famous Eadweard Muybridge and Etienne-Jules Marey photo-studies of human movement. Both of these bodies of work which constitute some of the greatest achievements of 19th century photography are also considered early progenitors of cinema. The core premise of the project was quite simple: record a small slice of time (a mere five seconds of movement) at extremely high frame rates (3000 frames per second) so that when played back in real time the seconds would stretch to a glacially-paced ten minutes. Figure Studies applies that methodology to a diverse range of human subjects: specialized bodies shaped by athletics dancing and physical labor as well as non-specialized bodies. Within each group there is a broad range of ages and body-types as well as ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Each subject is seen executing a particular movement sequence or concept that was arrived at through both artistic as well as scientific considerations.
