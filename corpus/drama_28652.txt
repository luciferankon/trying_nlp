In 1922 Honus Wagner expanded his entertainment repertoire by catching baseballs dropped from the top of the ten-story city-county building in Pittsburgh while hundreds of people watched and cameras rolled. Pittsburgh Police Superintendent and former professional ball player John C. Calhoun dropped three balls more than 150 feet to a waiting Wagner who was able to snare the first and third "pitches". The film of the stunt was later shown at the Carnegie Theatre as a prologue entitled "In the Name of the Law".
