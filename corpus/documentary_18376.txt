In a working-class Pittsburgh neighborhood called Swissvale filmmaker Daniel Kremer grew up on Woodstock Avenue the same street where his mother's family had lived since the 1900's. In this essay documentary Kremer returns from his current city San Francisco to revisit his old neighborhood specifically the now abandoned boarded-up house where he spent his childhood. Between unfortunately rare visits with his last remaining grandparent (now stricken with Alzheimer's) fond reminiscences of Woodstock Avenue as it once was and a memorably hilarious dinner table debate about the sanctity of Heinz ketchup Kremer meditates on how his childhood neighborhood crystallized his intense cinephilia shaped his life's work and how memories of lost places in all their fragility harden the shell of one's identity in ways we can never escape.
