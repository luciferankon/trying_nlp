One of Anne's best films. An American diplomat's wife meets an Italian vintner at an embassy soir√©e. He sees her as more than just her "husband's hostess". Her husband has been so focused on advancing his career that he has forgotten how to see her as a woman which the Italian reminds her that she is.
