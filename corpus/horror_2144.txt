Sharp-humored computer hacker Cynthia Damon wakes in a filthy all plastic cell with no idea who might have taken her or what they want. For a long time thats how things remain. All sense of comfort or dignity are stripped from Damon. Her endurance is tested her body deprived of food water warmth. Pragmatic appeals to give anything they want fall on deaf ears. Commands appear on the plastic wall in block letters - EAT SLEEP - and are ignored. Time aches painfully past but the 26 year-old 'Cyn' keeps her wits. A man arrives in the cell one day. A desk two chairs civilized manor...and a revolver in his hand. He introduces himself as the facility's administrator asks seemingly-irrelevant questions and all the while he plays with the gun. Laying it on the table spinning it around. When he spins too hard loses his grip Cyn grabs the weapon and shoots him six times. The door opens and the real Administrator steps in - proud that he has made a normal person a killer in such a small amount of time. He retrieves the weapon and reloads it...with a single bullet. How can he have known she would fire all the bullets be left unable to fire again when he entered? The simple power of mental suggestion subtle prompting. Hacking of the human will. That in essence is the Chamber project. Need a disposable killer a willing accomplice even a patsy? The Chamber provides. Cyn realizes - if she doesn't escape her mind will cease to be hers.
