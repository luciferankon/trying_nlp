After a Hollywood movie came through and added $250000 construction to the ailing structures turning the antique store into a fictional restaurant the town's owner turned that restaurant into non fiction. 15 years later although the owner was told he would go out of business the Whistle Stop Cafe and other shops thrive and the town brings in 25000 visitors a year. In 2006 Danny Vinson and four of his friends visit this most famous town saved by Hollywood. They go down Juliette's McCracken St. and speak with the local people.
