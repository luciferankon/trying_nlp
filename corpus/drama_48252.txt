In Winter is an independent feature emerging from the classical European tradition but presented in a timeless North American context and idiom shot in northern MN USA. We join Annika a stoic and solitary young woman in difficult circumstances in the barren human landscape of a small working class northern town in mid-winter. Her limited world is unsettled by the arrival of Mark an older wealthy stranger from out of town with whom she becomes entangled in a sexual affair. Invited to an upscale cocktail party with Mark Annika encounters Andrew and Kate jaded upper class party hosts and a noisy group of guests. She is put on the spot by Kate who is herself suffering from a similar oppressive circumstance though in more opulent surroundings. Faced with growing discomfort and insight into her reality and situation Annika sneaks out only to be drawn into a sordid encounter with a fellow loner at a local bar from which she narrowly escapes back to the relative safety of Mark's hotel room. The next morning as townsfolk gather for a bleak sermon on the Book of Job prepared by chaste but sensually driven Father Jim Annika and Mark lose themselves in lovemaking. A church hymn unfolds while the camera covers the expectant faces of townsfolk worn by daily cares and the intertwined bodies of the two lovers. Finally a panorama of ice industrial buildings and the empty sky lead to a poignant but ambiguous final conversation.
