One of a number of Soviet attempts to do a "western" in a Russian setting. During the Civil War (1918-20) between the Red Army and the White Army just after the Communist Revolution the Red Cavalry (the "good guys") are being victimized by rustlers stealing their horses. The hero devises a ruse in hopes of tricking the "bad guys" (the rustlers) and recovering the stolen herd.
