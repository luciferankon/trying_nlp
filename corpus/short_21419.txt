Maya is a single woman approaching 30. Her intrusive mother sets her up with a doctor and sends her money every week to use on therapy. The date with the doc is a bust but Maya gets an idea: instead of using mom's money on therapy why not take dance lessons? There she meets Sascha a terrific dancer with a winsome open spirit. Maya finds herself contriving to talk to Sascha at every opportunity. Soon Maya knows that in dance and perhaps in Sascha she has found herself.
