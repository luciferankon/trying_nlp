In the summer of 1972 two young women on vacation find themselves at the hands of a mentally unstable photographer trying to create the ultimate portfolio of human emotion. When Sara and Zoe arrive on the small vacation island they meet a family also staying on the island. Michael and James seem to be the only prospects around but they along with their mother Gwynn have returned to the island to close and sell their vacation home after suffering from the loss of their father. Gwynn is a long-time friend of the owner of the house Christine that Sara and Zoe are staying in. Christine is the grandmother and guardian of a young socially awkward man Delan who takes his photography very seriously. His attempts at showing the other side of emotion through his work lead him to capture more than just a photograph.
