50 years ago the powerful Cathy Come Home shone a light on the desperate housing problems gripping Britain. Now in 2016 this country is once again at the mercy of a housing meltdown - a lack of affordable homes sky-high rents 70 per cent of council housing stock sold a rise in homelessness. The housing officers in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham face daily queues of angry residents desperate for help - most are facing eviction. As one beleaguered housing officer says 'we are a housing options service without any options... I didn't get into housing to make people homeless'. Filmed over nine months this film shows us a whole new generation desperately looking in vain for a place to call home.
