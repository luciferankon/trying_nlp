STARHUNTER Transformation continues the adventures of Dante and Percy Montana interplanetary bounty-hunters (Starhunters) in a politically complex and diverse environment of settled worlds and a lot of empty dangerous space. They do their work from a relic of a one time luxury liner (The Trans-Utopian affectionately "The Tulip") retrofit (cheaply) for bounty-hunting work. This is the third season of the Starhunter series and takes place 13 years after the end of season two (Starhunter 2300) this time however that restless patch of alien genes inside us all (the "Divinity Cluster") starts to act up and run havoc over civilization.
