A documentary about New York band 'Blondie (III)' (qv) from their early beginnings in Bowery clubs like CBGBs alongside other up and coming bands like The Ramones 'Patti Smith (I)' (qv) & 'Talking Heads' (qv). The documentary tracks their years of international success through their internal problems and decline and then to their recovery and re-establishment leading to their being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 - an event that wasn't without its problems. Lots of interviews with band members past and present and their friends and contemporaries. Lots of clips of them performing through the years.
