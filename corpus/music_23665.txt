The spectacular mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli is joined by the ensemble Il Giardino Armonico in a program of baroque music from composer Antonio Vivaldi "The Red Priest". The concert encompasses arias and instrumental pieces from the oratorio Juditha Triumphans and the operas L'Olimpiade Tito Manlio Ottone in Villa La fida ninfa Bajazet (Il Tamerlano) and a chilling passionate performance from Farnace. The ensemble performs Concerto in C major for Flautino (affectionately known as the Penny Whistle) and Concerto in D major for Lute. The predominant portion of music was unknown and specially transcribed from Vivaldi's original manuscripts by musicologist Claudio Osele. The International Film Crew from RM Associates is directed by veteran opera director Brian Large and produced by classical music producer Colin Wilson. The sell-out musical event was presented at the superb art-deco Théatre des Champs-Eysées Paris in September 2000.
