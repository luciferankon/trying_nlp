A turn of dramatic events see six African American men disappear without a trace from this remote village town known by the English Crown as Townsville. 70 years later a veteran foreign correspondent has been researching the events surrounding the soldiers disappearance in hopes of piecing together the true story of local governments involvement in the wartime cover up. As his determination to uncover the truth grows he lifts the lid on an international cover up of a Mutiny by US soldiers in Australia that has been hidden for 70 years.
