It is foggy morning. Images of railroad tracks bridges cranes warehouses etc. Footsteps and a roaring voice sounds. A young man arrives at the heart of Stockholm. He looks in shop windows. His face is reflected in the glass. He notice a van on the street. He touches the furniture that is in the van. A baby cries at the image of a bare woman's breast. The baby calms down and sucks on the breast. The young man moves away from the van with furniture. A street-sweeper with broom appears in the gutter. There lies a man in the street who is being swept away by the broom. The young man goes through an iron gate and down a staircase. He enters a room whit a powerful man wearing a hat. The young man asks for work. The young man has ended up in a boxing-club.
