One Knife Stand is a darkly humorous story about the danger of sex with a stranger. Jerry and Robin can barely keep their hands off each other as they arrive at her apartment after meeting in a bar. But their intended one-night-stand begins to go ominously off course when Jerry unexpectedly encounters Robin's dog King. Jerry's not fond of dogs to start with but the situation takes a dangerous and surreal turn when King speaks to him while Robin is out of the room urging him to kill her. Is this some kind of "Son of Sam" scenario or is the dog really talking? Should Jerry follow King's dark command or can he resist? And whatever happened to that notion that a dog is a man's best friend?
