Judge B.K. Sinha and his adopted son Rajkishan are law-abider but the youngest in their house-hold Suresh prove to be the opposite - is hot-tempered and is into shady activities. His behavior crosses the limit when he accidentally kills a man and is on the run from not only the police but his dad and brother who will not hesitate to incarcerate him. Judge D.K. Sinha is an honest and hard-working man. He lives with his wife and two sons Rajkishan and Suresh. While he is confident that Rajkishan is honest and diligent he is clearly disappointed with Suresh who is not only dishonest but has a violent temper which gets him into trouble with the police. Imagine the shock the Sinha family gets when they come to know that Suresh has been arrested for murder and the case has been assigned to Suresh's dad for disposal.
