In 1988 artist and filmmaker Maggie Fooke began a cinema verit√© documentary diary to record the lives of the residents in a run down block of art deco flats in St Kilda where she lived. The flats 'Mandalay' had been marked for demolition as part of the high rise redevelopment of St Kilda's Upper Esplanade - 'an imitation of Australia's imitation of Waikiki' Surfers Paradise. The film records the struggles of residents to not only save their homes but to make a point about social arguments in urban planning the loss of low income housing and its effect on the community.
