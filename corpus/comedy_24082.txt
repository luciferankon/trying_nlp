Dayalan (Balaji) is a broker who lobbies between players and betters. As IPL semi finals approaches in Chennai Daya gets on to work. One of the latest tactics employed by bookies is to hire a taxi and be on the move making it hard to be traced while transacting. Panneer (Karunakaran) the taxi driver is hired by Dayalan and the two drive all around the city two days prior to the match. In their journey Daya learns from Panneer that he is in immense debt which has kept him separated from his wife Rama (Vijayalakshmi) and Daya offers to help Panneer settle his bills. The next day Daya is found murdered in his room and the blame is on Panneer. Confusion gets bigger a lot of people are involved in match-fixing and all they have is a clueless day left for the big match day which means money.
