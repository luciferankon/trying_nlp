The Turin Shroud is proved through DNA to be real. Ray Heller (a Priest) was in charge of the research and is on a quest to find the stolen DNA. Michael Soran is a man without faith (a former priest who lost his wife). Together they set out to recover the lost DNA...but they have to fight for their lives against the mysterious Vernon Devan and his body of seven...could these be the same seven disciples of the devil recounted in the medieval chronicles? Who will reach the DNA first and prove it to the world...? Good or Evil ?
