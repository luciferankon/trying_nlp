Canto y Danza is an intimate portrait of two women's past and present life on both sides of the Atlantic. The singer Tatiana and the dancer Ligia belong to the generation of Nicaraguans sent to study in Eastern Europe after the Sandinist Revolution in 1979. Dreaming that they will contribute to the development of the Central-American country one day they set out for Berlin and Kiev. But when they return in the early 90s not only has post cold-war Europe changed. In Nicaragua after a decade of civil war and a failed revolution their future is more than uncertain.
