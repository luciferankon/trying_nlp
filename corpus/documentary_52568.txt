Lost Vegas seeks to explore the contrast between the culture of wealth and indulgence on the Strip and those living on the margin of society. The homeless are often swept under the rug: considered unsightly to the tourists who flock to Vegas in search of a good time. An "out of sight out of mind" mentality harms those ignored by society at large. The "Lost Vegas" team aims to shed light on the people whose voices have been lost.
