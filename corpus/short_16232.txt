Each video within "180" was originally created for three different sets of the 60x60 Project which is comprised of Cosic's 60 videos with 60 second compositions by 60 different composers. These one hundred eighty videos form a new visual structure which inspired the creation of sixty seconds of sound to accompany the final audio visual experience.
