This documentary film is a personal journey of a man from the Dayak Kenyah indigenous tribe of Borneo as he returns to the burial grounds of his ancestors deep into the heart of the ancient Borneo rainforest. He is accompanied by 5 other Dayak warriors and men from 5 different countries incl a Lakota man from standing rock reservation in South Dakota. The two cultures connect as they make this seven day journey through dangerous rapids and small Dayak villages along the way in search of the answers to the destruction of the forests and the deep spiritual connection of the Dayak and the forests in which they live. The film explores the reasons why the Dayak left the village of Long Saan 40 years ago and there are scenes jumping back between present day and 80 years ago from an old black and white film that the producers found from the 1930's. It is a very personal story as Philus the main character returns to pay respects to his mother who passed away when he was 13 years old and captures the joy and excitement when he returns to the lands he loves and has dreamed about ever since he left as a young boy. There is a lot of music in this documentary as Robi from the popular Indonesian band Navicula is the main singer along with traditional Dayak and Lakota songs and music.
