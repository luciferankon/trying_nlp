The teens in a small town in Indiana have a problem they have nowhere to skateboard or ride BMX. In an attempt to get by many have been arrested while riding in locations around the city. Running For Something focuses on a man who decides to bring attention to the situation and just maybe raise enough money to build a skate/bmx park for the city. His mission: to run 83 miles over the course of 3 days the only problem is he's never done it before.
