Ulay is conceptual artist Frank Uwe Laysiepen whose photography pushed the boundaries of the medium and whose love affair with Marina Ambramovic produced some of the world's best-known examples of performance art. Diagnosed with cancer shortly after agreeing to film the documentary Ulay's illness informs Project Cancer which is part-retrospective part-visual document of the year he believed could be the last of his extraordinary life. "The body is the medium par excellence" Ulay is fond of saying. Now that his has been invaded by illness which threatens to consume it it is time for reflection for farewells and to remember a life dedicated to art. Project Cancer does this with humour and profundity.
