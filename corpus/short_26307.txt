In this film what we usually perceive as horizon line is rotated by 180 Â° breaking and short-circuiting the image vertically. A kind of questioning "habits" of the eye and ear. The conceptual approach of seeing yourself seeing of hearing yourself speaking - an elementary projection into something else - is denied in favor of the imaginary function in order to re-examine what seems to be immutable: the sense of truth and the truth of the sense.
