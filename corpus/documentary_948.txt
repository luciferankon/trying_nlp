6 Episodes: Eggs Garlic Wheat Tomatoes Honey and Pork. Food has fueled and propelled humans throughout our evolution. The story of food is our story. But where we once enjoyed an intimate tactile nourishing and soulful relationship with food we are now largely disconnected from it and oblivious to its source. Each episode delves into our relationship with a particular food (eggs garlic wheat tomatoes honey and pork) drawing on insights from farmers scientists backyard gardeners and award-winning chefs like Canadian Michael Stadtlander and Michael Anthony of New York's Gramercy Tavern. Along the way we will tackle issues ranging from the impact of imported foods on local economies to the rise of backyard beekeeping and will invite viewers to consider the benefits of moving beyond our reliance on the supermarket for everyday staples.
