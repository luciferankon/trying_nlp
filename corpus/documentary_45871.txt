Just days into the expedition a winter storm warning became the infamous "Polar Vortex" that dumped punishing lake-effect snow on the Buffalo area and sent temperatures below freezing in all 50 states. The team battled freezing rain brutal temperatures and heavy snow on their journey through the heart of Central New York. Why? To raise awareness of plastic microbeads in cosmetic products and to push for a statewide ban on these products.
