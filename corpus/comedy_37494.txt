A spin-off series from the UK series "Love They Neighbour" Love Thy Neighbour in Australia was filmed in 1979 (three years after the original series ended). Consisting of seven episodes the series saw the character Eddie Booth transplanted to the Sydney suburb of Blacktown. The explanation given for the absence of Eddie's wife and child is Eddie has emigrated first and the family will join him after he has established himself. The antagonism between Eddie and Bill was replaced by the difficulty of Eddie adapting to Australia.
