When Canadian figure skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier skated a flawless routine in Salt Lake City it should have been a gold medal performance they would always remember. But instead a Russian pair won despite a number of errors and the controversy that followed was one that the skating world will never forget. After a furious debate that engulfed the games for nearly a week an extraordinary deal made both pairs champions. Both teams saw their medals tarnished but not as much as figure skating itself after the biggest judging scandal in skating history.
