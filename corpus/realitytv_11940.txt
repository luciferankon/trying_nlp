The Australia-wide competition from the makers of My Kitchen Rules will see six teams from around the country put their homes on the line and their skills to the test in a fight for supremacy and a life-changing prize. Together they'll travel the country hand over the keys to their own homes and leave their competition rivals to transform every room in their house...anyway they want. But there's a twist! Each home comes with a set of House Rules set out by the owners - a list of do's and don'ts the other teams can choose to follow bend or break. It's the key to a whole new life but will it open the door to their dreams or their worst nightmare? Host Johanna Griggs will be at the helm as six brave teams gamble with the most important possession in their lives.
