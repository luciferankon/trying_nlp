An exploration of current circumstance that leads to the opposite of the probable conclusion. A conclusion based on morality decency and normal human behavior. Human behavior that comes in the form of a modern acceptable definition of a normal character according to the majority of western civilized society.

And it is at this point that Senor Javier Munoz breached his snapping point thus moving him forward into another form of life that he was and is entirely unprepared for. His life of mediocrity and want has ended. His exploration has begun.
