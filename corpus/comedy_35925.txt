André Mahy an artistic but unemployed director gets an offer to make a movie. He accepts the offer enthusiastically. The script of the movie appears to be a 'Kiekeboe' comic story entitled "Misstakes". This is where the main story begins in which the Kiekeboe family has to deal with a gang of diamond smugglers. Suspense humor and a little bit of romance are the basic ingredients of this story. The story of André who goes to extremes to shoot his film contains the same elements. A fascinating dialogue develops between the fictional story of the family Kiekeboe and the real story of André Mahy and his film crew. At the end of the movie the distinction between these two story lines fades away. Fiction and reality melt together in an endless tangle of plots of which the 'real' end is hard to find.
