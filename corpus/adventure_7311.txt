In 1264 King Henry III of Britain is facing an uprising by many noblemen led by Simon de Montfort who wants to overthrow him. As such Henry appoints a band of his most loyal subjects as his guardsmen to uphold the law of the land in an effort to retain peace. Chief among these men is Sir Richard Clovell who fought for the King in many a battle throughout Europe and who is known to wield a Spanish sword won in one of those battles. In his travels he learns in the dying words from one of the King's spies that Baron Breaute ruler of a region called Rochefort is plotting with de Montfort to put together a rebellion army funded by a treasury of plundered gold hidden somewhere in Rochefort. Clovell and his men are able to run Breaute and his men out of Rochefort but he knows that Breaute will be back to retrieve the hidden gold. Meanwhile the King is defeated in battle against de Montfort. When news of the defeat spreads many of the men accompanying Clovell question their allegiance to the King. The villagers of Rochefort who despised the tyranny of Breaute's rule also are uncertain if they want to join Clovell in battling Breaute when he returns. Despite Lady Eleanor his wife to be urging Clovell to leave Rochefort before Breaute's return Clovell vows to be faithful to the King to protect the people of Rochefort and retrieve the gold wherever it's hidden.
