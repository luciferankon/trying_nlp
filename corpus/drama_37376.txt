Upasikka a Sanskrit word which translates as 'servant' or 'attendent' is how the mysterious Mahatmas used to call Helena P. Blavatsky. "Upasikka Madam Blavatsky Legend" is the first feature film on life of Madame Blavatsky an extraordinary personality of her time regardless of the way we decide to look at her philosophy. However the film Upasikka is not a film which praises her work; nor does it defy and debunk what she stood for in spite the fact that she was one of the most controversial figures of the nineteenth century. Operating within the confinements of the world of fiction Upasikka charters Madame Blavatsky's indelible legacy and its contagious effect on thousands whom she has had a strong spiritual impression on. Furthermore the film makes an attempt to capture the deep magical and symbolic reality by going beyond the appearance of things. It invites the audience to the explore the unchartered areas such as occultism spiritual discourse astral and transcendental visions. To the tutored eye or the average cinephile Upasikka could also appear as a hallucination in the late-romantic sensibility. Since Upasikka is the final product of a long and arduous process of research and soul-searching answers for esoteric questions on theosophy it is a must for those who crave to know more about the life and works of a titanic human being who enriched history through her contribution to Buddhist discourse.
