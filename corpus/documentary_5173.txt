In the small Montreal municipality of Outremont two very different communities live side by side: Hassidic Jews and their French-Catholic neighbors. Intent on preserving their traditional lifestyle the Hassidim distance themselves from outsiders. The French Catholics respond to their little-understood neighbors with a mixture of curiosity frustration and mistrust. Through evocative personal interviews as well as scenes from daily life Bonjour Shalom examines the complex dynamics involved in this clash of cultures.
