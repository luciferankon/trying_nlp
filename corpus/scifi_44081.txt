Three bikini clad heirs to a space age kingdom on the eve of their inauguration are tricked and sent into a black hole and back in time by their evil stepmother Voluptina. She and her half human sidekick have plans of gaining power and with the aide of a mad scientist (with a penchant for being evil to teddy-bears)they plot to get rid the Bikini Girls. In the meantime the Bikini Girls back in 75 million BC are battling dinosaurs finding plutonium and using cheese with great effect. Will they get back in time for their inauguration is inauguration even spelled right? Bikini Girls will rock your world (if you believe the title music).
