A live-theater production which Elizabeth Taylor stars as Emily Loomis a professor of ancient history at a small California college who reluctantly agrees to rent a room in her house to one of the new students named Stewart Anderson. Both happen to be loners (she with a secret past) and although they initially get on each others nerves they eventually realize the rapport to help one another emerge from their emotional shells.
