Barbara is overwhelmed. Overwhelmed by her parents relationship; by the existing conflict between her wishes and the society she has to live in; by love; by lack of love; by the disconnections. One dawn she returns from a party driving at almost 60 m/h with her boyfriend Federico two friends and lots of alcohol. Between death impotence and incomprehension the story of her grandmother Olga will emerge. At the right time with a precise wisdom with the understanding of a family -and familiar- (hi)story of Italian immigrants repeated trough generations.
