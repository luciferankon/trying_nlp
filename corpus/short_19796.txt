An Electronic Life is a mini-Epic relaying the foundation for the classic tale of woman versus machine. A downtrodden career woman (Plain Jane; every-woman) struggles daily against the time clock of her workplace and her life. Our hero's quest to satiate her need for inner peace from the battle against modern machinery and her need for outer physical interaction with the rest of humanity plays out in a captivating story depicting a spiritual journey traveled within the confines of a labyrinth of cubicles. Jane ponders the profound and ancient questions "Who am I?" and "Why am I here?" Ultimately it will lead her (and the audience) along the path of enlightenment to arrive at conclusions which will simultaneously mystify and satisfy. Long after the last of the closing credits roll viewers will pine for their vacation days far away from uncooperative cell phones quarrelsome copy machines and meat-eating computer monitors. Christopher Sylvia has reminded us that life is worth living; all we have to do is conquer the mountain of technology that looms large over us on a daily basis. Seamlessly blending thematic elements from philosophy and religion into the genres of science-fiction horror drama and romance as well as adding a hint of comedy (with a sardonic bent) balanced by a keen sense of morality writer/director Sylvia creates a powerful parable for the ages.
