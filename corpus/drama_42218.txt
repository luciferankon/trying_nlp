Danny is a Tel-Aviv taxi driver a divorced father to a sweet little girl. Danny drives his taxi mostly at night. The nights in Tel-Aviv are always dark and mostly mean. When in motion driving very seldom will Danny catch glitters of tiny lights. Usually he stumbles along dubious passengers weary losers drugged prostitutes crumpled bills and sweating asphalt.
