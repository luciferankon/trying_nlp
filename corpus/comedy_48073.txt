A young American woman (Sydne Rome) traveling through Italy finds herself in a strange Mediterranean villa where nothing seems right. Her visit becomes an absurd decadent oversexed version of "Alice in Wonderland" with Marcello Mastroianni as the maddest of mad hatters and Roman Polanski a kinky March hare.
