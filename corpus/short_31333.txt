This isn't a traditional outtakes reel but rather a short about the ad-libbing and different takes of each scene including a nice collection of those unused moments throughout the segment. A number of bloopers are part of this piece as well which includes comments from director Rawson Marshall Thurber and actors Jennifer Aniston Kathryn Hahn Will Poulter Emma Roberts Nick Offerman and Jason Sudeikis. They tell us about the acting/improvisation processes used in the film and we see plenty of alternate takes.
