In the studios of Best Brains Kevin Murphy and Michael J. Nelson put on an infomercial about two tapes the MST3K Info Club had for sale: the "Poopie!" tape of bloopers and "The MST Scrapbook" a video diary of Mystery Science Theater 3000 from its early days on KTMA until Season 6. Much of the special includes many standard infomercial quirks such as forced line delivery attempts at "wit" and a special deal - both tapes for the low low price of $30. Trace Beaulieu (sporting a bad Australian accent) appears later and joins Mike and Kevin in shilling for the tapes. Also shown during the special in-between the Mike/Kevin/Trace segments are around 8-10 minutes of highlights from each tape.
