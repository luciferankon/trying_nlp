Located in the North Taylor Avenue section of Pittsburgh PA Randyland is the brainchild of Randy Gilson a longtime resident of this Pittsburgh community. He purchased the building and grounds at auction for $10000 in 1995 in an attempt to combat the blight of this economically depressed neighborhood. Randyland has evolved into a community center and continues to be a source of pride and artistic inspiration for the community.
