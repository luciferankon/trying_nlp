EXILES is a new unscripted docu-series format about nationality identity and making it in a modern globalised world. It's also about other countries and how they appear to outsiders. EXILES is about the new Emigrant and the new places they go - in this case Vancouver Canada. The show follows 6 young Irish 20-somethings as they emigrate from Ireland to Canada to start a new life and chase their dreams.
