This short film promotes the proper management of animal manures to maintain and improve soil quality on the farm. Application of animal manure is the most natural practical and economical way to enrich the soil and increase plant growth: it improves poor soils and makes good soils better. Proper storage and application techniques are demonstrated with International Harvester manure-handling equipment and Farmall tractors.
