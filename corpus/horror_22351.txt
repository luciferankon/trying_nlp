New York City is one of the prime breeding grounds for the vampire a creature that is very selective in whom it chooses to bestow the gift of eternal life. Among the candidates are the twenty-something Tricia who desires to experience any life but her own; Jonathan a young vampire with an attitude problem; and of course a few serial killer types like Joel Winter who search for something beyond their psychopathic lives... But there's one problem--a rogue vampire who is turning people who aren't worthy of "The Gift"--and it's up to Angie Karnstein to find her sister and put an end to these creatures with the tainted blood.
