In June 2016 our two man team completed the first ever source-to-mouth expedition along the Kwanza River in Angola. We used a 40 year-old foldable wooden kayak that we paddled and carried along the 1300km journey. This trip recorded information on wildlife and human activity along the remote stretches of the river. So far we have raised over USD25000 for The HALO Trust an organization specialising in the removal of the debris of war such as landmines. Our journey is currently being reviewed by Guinness World Records. This is the story of how we did it.
