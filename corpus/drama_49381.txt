All life on the surface of earth has been wiped out; except for a few survivors assigned to Shelters deep underground. Tyler was selected at random to survive and is now locked one hundred feet below the surface in Shelter 78713. His only form of communication with what's left of the outside world is a computer program named A.D.A.M.
