A year of educational life at a vibrant public K-12 school. Filmed on location over a year the film celebrates the 75th anniversary of the University of Florida's premiere lab school P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School and documents the school's innovative approach to education. From seeing fifth graders use new technologies in science and second graders dance in music class the film proves that public school can be truly work for teachers and students if faculty "think out of the box" and embrace new methods of education. Shaping the Future shows that the approach to teaching the "whole child" is the key to keeping kids in school and educating students for the 21st Century.
