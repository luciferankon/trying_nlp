A light-hearted look at toys that should never have hit the shop shelves from an un-PC doll and Ouija board for kids to Clackers - the 'balls-on-a-string' game that threatened to blind an entire generation in the 1970s. A liberal helping of retro advertisements and archive footage is coupled with comments from the likes of Richard O'Brien Richard Bacon and the manufacturers themselves.
