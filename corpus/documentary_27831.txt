We lack witness to time says Jřrgen Haugen Sřrensen one of the most noteworthy Danish sculptors. Free of the restrictions of styles rules or schools he gives unstintingly of his experience and impressions of life of everything he perceives thinks and sees. Film director Malene Ravn has spent the last ten years recording the birth of Jřrgen Haugen Sřrensen's work from the moment at which he returned to clay and the figurative art he started with as a young man. "I've been keeping the best bit for last. Now I think it's great fun to work in a material that's quick and cheap and gives you an immediate response. What's fun about clay is that you can go on shoving it around and moving it about making it respond and express different things." Haugen Sřrensen tells stories in his clay sculptures and the film depicts with intense intimacy the artist at work from a tiny feeling a thought an idea to the finished work. Jřrgen Haugen Sřrensen's enormous energy sweeps the film along as gigantic dog fights distorted corpses and skulls emerge from between his hands.
