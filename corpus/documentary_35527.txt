The commitment of three film directors used to structure a story that calls for reflection. Greek Theo Angelopoulos traveling from Athens to Ostia the Roman beach where Pasolini was killed. Far from there in a Spanish train station VÃ­ctor Erice wanders in an interview about the film resistance. And in Italy Tonino Guerra Ninetto Davoli and Nico Naldini lend his voice to the missing Passolini to close a historic triangle on film and solitude.
