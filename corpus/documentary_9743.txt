There is a contest each year that can change a young skater's life. There are no pros with million dollar endorsement deals here just real kids with real lives and everything on the line. This is the story of a few of the best from France Brazil and the USA as they risk everything for a chance of a lifetime. Motivation 3: The Next Generation is a proper follow-up to The Motivation but this time the stakes are so much higher. We're in deep with real kids escaping poverty and violence crashing in skate-houses or still living with mom. For all of these kids a win at Tampa Am could mean a way out and an opportunity to do what they love for a living-skate.
