This is the story of two very different people. Taylor - A womanizing actor who cares only for his own well being; and Jessica - A nerdy socially awkward office worker who is taken advantage of by her boss and friends. As both of them go about their daily routine they each have one of the worst days of their lives. They are unaware that something very strange is going to bring them together indefinitely.
