Didier and Anne both trying to escape from their lives literally bump into one another on the streets of Paris and through a series of adventures set about creating a quiet revolution in their lives. Clear-eyed witty and entirely original this is a film of friendship and an exploration of our need not to run away but to create what we really want for ourselves.
