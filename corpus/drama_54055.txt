First feature length feature of 'Scott Hicks' this black-and-white experimental short feature film is about a young drifter who drops out of university and goes bush only to later return to his girl-friend. The theme of wayward youth roaming would again be revisited by Hicks in _Down the Wind (1975)_ (qv) and _Freedom (1982)_ (qv).
