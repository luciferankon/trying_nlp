Learning that Montana is about to become a state and that property values will rise rapidly Caldwell is using his outlaw gang to force the ranchers off their land. To fight back Tuttle sends for the Trail Blazers and unaware of Maynard's identity Caldwell appoints him Marshal. The Trail Blazers Ken (Ken Maynard) Hoot (Hoot Gibson) and Bob (Bob Steele) are called into the Big Horn Territory to investigate the destroying of ranches by a gang of desperadoes. The ranchers have banded together to hold out against the Selectmen who have put a tremendous water tax on them. Storekeeper Ira Phillips (John Bridges) banker Roger Caldwell (Harry Woods) and land-recorder Henry Wagner (Karl Hackett) are the men behind the trouble as they have been informed by territorial commissioner Albert Lane (Weldon Heyburn) that Big Horn is soon to become part of the state of Montana and they want to clean up on land deals. Ken Hoot and Bob make their headquarters at the ranch of Enid Bennett (Betty Miles) and when Ken is appointed sheriff of Big Horn he makes Hoot and Bob his deputies and the three go to work to put an end to the crooked dealings.
