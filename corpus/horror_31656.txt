Three Australian stories of the supernatural are recounted in this anthology. Rick (Jack Charles) an Aboriginal boy living near a swamp on Bribie Island is haunted by an American solider who drowned in quicksand. Ruby (Tracey Moffatt) and her family live in a house near long-abandoned train tracks which still carry ghostly apparitions. A landlord (Lex Marinos) has trouble evicting the tenants of an old warehouse: a couple that's been dead for years.
