The White Elephant is a experimental essay on the value of political pictures in Rio de Janeiro during the times of worldcup and olympic games. Gentrification actionism as well as architecture arts and global investments are part of a struggle for the 'right' picture of Rio. The film reflects the impossibility to not be part of this struggle.
