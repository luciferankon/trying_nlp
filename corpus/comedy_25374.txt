Grandma does a lot of things that she wishes she didn't have to do. She has lived through horror listening to her Grandson and even working out. She has survived many birthdays and has had many fantasies regarding chocolate. She hates bedtime stories and loves cats. Grandma has the ability to make it to the bathroom everyday and sometimes she even makes it on time! Grandma leads a fairly...kind of...normal life.
