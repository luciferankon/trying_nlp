Mississippi Queen follows Paige a southerner returning home who digs past the mask of hospitality to examine gay values and the ex-gay ministry interviewing southerners on both sides of the issues including her parents who help convert homosexuals. Mississippi Queen charts a woman's mission to find much-needed answers. Paige Williams travels across the country and through the years as she explores the distance between her upbringing and her current lifestyle. The south stands as the backdrop and her parents as the main characters. Growing up a good Southern Baptist girl Paige learned to love God first and then family. However her senior year in high school would lead to a relationship with a girl and all that would turn on its head. Over ten years later she attempts to find balance in her marriage and commitment to a woman their newborn and the fact that her parents run Mississippi's only ex-gay ministry. However this story goes beyond just the Williams family. It is about the south where there is a distinct queer culture that manages to thrive despite the religious fervor or perhaps because of it. Paige interviews gays who find no incongruity with going to church and loving the Lord and then those who feel they can't be a part of religion without being judged. She talks to former homosexuals who converted due to their commitment to Christ and the wish to no longer sin. She also meets with the people who want to help them change. At the heart of the film though is the middle ground where Paige and her parents attempt to meet. They don't always get there but the making of Mississippi Queen helps them get a little closer-- to God and each other.
