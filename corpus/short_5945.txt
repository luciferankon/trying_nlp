Marcus doesn't trust what Lucien said about the 3D writer. However in order to convince Marcus Lucien tells him that he knows everything about Marcus because Marcus is a character in his new book. Meantime a police officer is investigating a murder case that happened lately. He finds some clues and suspects but he is still trying to find some important information. Then he remembers that before the murder case happened there is a guy came into the office and said he wanted to report a murder case. The police officer told him to leave because they couldn't believe the "future" murder case that he reported. Surprisingly the police officer finds that the date that guy reported is exactly the murder case happened. Lucien tells Marcus that he knows Marcus's secret. Lucien says he knows that Marcus's wife left him and he told her to do so. Marcus gets furious because he believes Lucien steals his wife. The police officer finds that the guy reported another case few days ago and it happens 4pm today. He rushes out of his office immediately. Marcus kills Lucien by using an injection needle. When he is dealing with the corpse he finds Lucien's shoelaces are tied to the table leg. He finds a note on the back of the table when he bends down to untie the she lace. The note reads: It's not too late to run now. The police officer finds Lucien's house. There is no one in the house and he finds a note on his table. The note shows Marcus's address and number. When the police officer rushes to Marcus's office it's almost 4pm. He finds nobody in the office but he sees a shoelace out of the clothes chest. When he opens the chest and tries to check the chest he is pushed into the chest. He finds Lucien's corpse in the chest which reminds him that last time when Lucien came in to report the murder case he said two victims. Marcus is pointing the gun to his head and the watch on Marcus's wrist shows 4pm.
