It's Tuesday in Cleveland; a storm arrives that will last three days. We watch rain fall as we listen to a DJ and the jazz he plays at WLOH. We also watch separate stories of a cab driver who's suffered a recent loss a janitor who may lose his job a junkie whose infant daughter is in the care of the woman's abusive father a couple who argue after she won't let him give a restaurant dessert to a homeless man a tile maker desperate for money to buy clay for a new job and an alcoholic prevaricating father whose adult son is long-suffering. Each is isolated each seeks a connection; some find one.
