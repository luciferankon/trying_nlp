Early 90's. The life of Zakhar Zimin and his orphanage changed dramatically one rainy night. The collapse of the old orphanage left all the children homeless. The district officials decide to set the kids apart by sending them to other orphanages so Zakhar turns to the villagers for help. They allocate the kids among their own homes and families for the time the orphanage is rebuilt. A story of struggle by the unloved children for a place in this world.
