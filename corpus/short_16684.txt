A gypsy woman with a basket of wares endeavors to persuade the young lady of the house to make a purchase but failing to do so offers a charm stone that possesses the power on being rubbed of bringing into effect any wish of the owner. The gypsy gives evidence of this by rubbing the stone and instantly bringing from space a little girl who appears at her side. The young lady immediately covets the wondrous pebble and a bargain being struck she becomes its owner and is seen to at once to test its powers by bringing to her side her lover. Decorating him with a "buttonhole" plucked in the grounds of the mansion she is embraced in an affectionate manner but is no sooner released from her lover's arms than she causes the "buttonhole" to change into a large rhubarb leaf which the lover flings to the ground in a fit of disgust the leaf vanishing amidst a volume of smoke. She continues to practice upon the pebble with astonishing results and from changing her lover into a black man and converting him into a master magician with broom for a wand she finally affects the disappearance of both her swain and herself amidst a cloud of smoke which completely envelops them.
