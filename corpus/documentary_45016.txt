The End of America details the ten steps a country takes when it slides toward fascism. It's not a "lefty" taught-to-me but rather a historical look at trends in once-functioning democracies from modern history that are being repeated in our country today. It gives any reader (or viewer of the lecture) a much-needed history lesson and constitutional refresher. Most importantly it puts the recent gradual loss of civil liberties in the U.S. in a historical context. The average American might not be alarmed at AT&T selling our private information to the federal executive but when this action is seen as part of a larger series of erosions and events a pattern emerges with unfortunate consequences that become disturbingly clear.
