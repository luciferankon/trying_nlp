Kirk Hartman is no longer a mischievous screw up teenage son and school kid but has a job as a graphical artist and lives alone in the city where he works. When his parents move to Europe the tables are turned as he finds himself placed in charge as surrogate-father of his 17-year-old brother Corey 14-year-old sister Phoebe and 7-year-old brother Russel. Meanwhile he woos the beautiful neighbor Elizabeth Waters who still finds him rather immature but learns to appreciate his charm and kind heart while developing her maternal potential as the motherless Hartman family lacks a woman's hand. Finally there's Kirk's slick macho friend next door Eddie Balducci.
