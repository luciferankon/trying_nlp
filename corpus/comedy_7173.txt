Big Babies is an excellent children's programme using CGI green screen and live film technology a clever script takes us on the adventures if the big babies (mainly Rocco and Brooke) the babies with adult heads. From The terrors of the dinosaur train to a trip to the the market with their daredevil soft toy Budge watching their every move. A great series which kept my children (and me!) entertained.
