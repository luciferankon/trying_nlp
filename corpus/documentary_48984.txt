The L.A. Hardcore is a television series taking us on a journey through Los Angeles in the 1980s from the perspective of skateboarding and punk rock. The story is told via a series of readings on the era (including Tony Hawk reading from his own biography Henry Rollins and comedian Bill Hicks!) alongside live music performances from bands like Black Flag and The Circle Jerks.
