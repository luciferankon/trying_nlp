In 1999 two Seattle-based Christian rock bands broke up. Their members were frustrated and disillusioned with the creative limitations and ethical complications that came from mixing art commerce and sincere religious devotion. The members of these two bands decided to undertake an experiment together. They would start a new band-one that was angry sarcastic vulgar and aggressively antisocial. They would perform in neo-fascist uniforms. Their wives and girlfriends would dress up as battered domestic abuse victims while carrying giant pictures of AK-47s. They would feature go-go dancers and male strippers on stage and a performance artist who gorges himself on bananas until puking them into a fishbowl. And their published manifesto would declare that this was the music that would usher in the apocalypse-RECONSTRUCTION! AMEN! They were called Raft of Dead Monkeys. This movie tells their story.
