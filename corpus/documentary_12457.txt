Follows 7 young friends over 3 years after the war in Kosovo. Through their stories of trauma and recovery despair and renewed hope we witness their remarkable transformation from children of conflict into the young leaders of a fledgling state. A Normal Life is an intimate irreverent and unexpectedly poignant documentary - an intensely personal account of growing up and moving beyond trauma.
