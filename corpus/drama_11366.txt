Thomas Rotterdam is an alpha dog doctor who loses his medical license due to rule-breaking and lousy people skills. He's a genius when working with the body and recognizes that bodies tell stories. He becomes a super-trainer (getting financing from suspect backers) to open his own gym. Bodies of Work-NYC is a fitness church whose commandment is "Your body's a temple. Attract worshippers." It's run by Neyda Farris former U. N. worker who realizes only body and soul are universal. She spars with Thomas while juggling her buff bizarre staff. Some trainers love what they do. For others Bodies of Work-NYC is a pit-stop on the way to different dreams.
