They had only one goal "change the world through motion picture." However over the thirteen years they have lived in Los Angeles they have come to realize securing a movie deal is more difficult than they had imagined. Nameless Studios a leading producer of soft-core made-for-television late night movies; Sex is their domain profit their motive. Their newest project: The Lone Rancher a "softy" western period piece of two lovers on a ranch.
