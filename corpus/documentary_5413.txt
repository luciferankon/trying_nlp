Living in exile in France for the past 25 years Abbas Fahdel last year made Retour Å• Babylone the occasion to return home be reunited with his childhood friends and explore a reality that was now alien to him. In this film Fahdel's camera shows us Iraqis in another light and the hopes and fears of these men and women who escaped the nightmare of a dictatorship only to be mired in chaos. He is better equipped than anyone for this task. He is both an "outside" angle of vision and a brotherly view. An Iraqi among Iarqis he embodies a reference point in the turmoil. His presence and commitment during the past year his receptivity during those months when everyone was preparing for war explains why his camera is never indiscreet or prying.
