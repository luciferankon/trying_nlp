Ancient stone structures have been discovered in America. Theories of early cultures carrying advanced engineering skills across the ocean have created a rift among academics. Although it is indisputable that these structures exist their study has become controversial culturally loaded and generally spurned pushing many researchers out to the edges of their disciplines. Written In Stone follows a group of aging archaeologists retired researchers and eccentric scientists who are considered the 'fringe.' For over 50 years they have been at the forefront of studying ancient civilizations in America and beyond...often under criticism and even hostility from their own academic peers. Over the past century differing perspectives on who built these stone structures has wreaked havoc in academic circles. The theory of mass migration with its waves of Phoenicians Celts and Vikings inhabiting America has become an archaeological flash-point. Science has broken down before it ego has eclipsed reason and the argument itself has become the central issue. If such a civilization had existed here before how is it possible that modern science has not confirmed it? What is the relationship between Native Americans and these sites? Why do academics to this day fight amongst themselves? Written In Stone takes the audience deep into the forests of New England on a trip that may rewrite history; showing the real world of not-so-objective science personal intrigue and cultural identity that surrounds ancient stone sites in the middle of a one-hundred year mystery.
