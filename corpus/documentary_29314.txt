The expedition that shot this film was sponsored by the French Government and the Museum of Man for the purpose of making a lasting record of the native tribes in French Equatorial Africa and the USA had nothing to do with except show the film that was shot by the French expedition and edited into an exploitation stinker. The expedition members consisted of a group of young French scientists. The resulting film that was taken from the extensive day-to-day footage was chopped down to about only 68 minutes (USA time) and while there may be unseen and untold thousands of feet on this film at the Museum of Man the exploitation-type film that resulted was lots of native nudity a badly-photographed gorilla hunt and the dissection of animals by the natives. Tagged by the producers as a Documentary (to get by the nudity) it got MPPA approval and code seal number 14460.
