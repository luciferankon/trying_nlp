After a raucous bachelor party groom-to-be Adam (Kevin Zaideman) wakes up next to a prostitute hired by his incompetent best friends Rob (Mike Leamen) and Jesse (Austin Anderson). A prenuptial infidelity is scandalous enough but this young woman also happens to be very very dead. Don't worry. It's not their fault. She was diabetic and forgot her insulin shot. Callous scheming pimp Joe (Shang Forbes) gives them the name of a specialist (James Adomian) in Texas who knows how to dispose of bodies. With the corpse in the trunk of their car Adam Rob and Jesse must drive to Texas and back before Adam's wedding to Stephanie (Lacey Hannan). Stephanie's father the mayor (Eddie Pepitone) lets Adam know that there will be serious consequences if Adam isn't back in time to marry his little girl. Along the way they accidentally kidnap Adam's brother Paul (Dan Cummins) who converted to Judaism to win the affection of a girl. The sad-sack still keeps Kosher despite his affections being roundly rejected - much to the annoyance of his mother. Oy vey. Will they rid themselves of their bustier-bedecked burden? Will Adam get back to Nebraska in time to say "I do?" Will Paul find his inner mensch? Will Jesse make sweet sweet barnyard love to women in chicken masks? Or are they all just royally TRUNK'D?
