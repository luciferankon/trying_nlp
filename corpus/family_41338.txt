We've all heard the saying 'you shouldn't judge a book by its cover' and perhaps nobody embodies that sage wisdom more than Benny or Ugly Benny as he has come to be called by those who encounter him at 'For Pet's Sake Pet Store.' A fuzzy frumpled tiny ball of frazzled yarn with four paws and two sweet eyes peeking out Benny certainly wasn't much to look at when he first arrived as a puppy on the doorstep of the pet store. Sam and Emma found him there waiting in a little box when they arrived for work one morning just staring up at them with those tiny lovable little eyes and to this day no one knows where he came from or who brought him there.
