Frieemftman deals with two characters' experience in a hospital. Kevin (Nathan Berg) gets and "Iplant" and Ipod that is implanted into the body that plays music through any nearby stereo. One of the possible side effect of the Iplant is appendicitis which he develops sending him to the hospital. Camina's (Andrea Sgarlatti) bad behavior sends her to the mental ward of the hospital. The two characters never cross paths but Thornburgh who plays himself enters in and out of each of their lives. Thornburgh who wrote and starred in this film has been blind since birth.
