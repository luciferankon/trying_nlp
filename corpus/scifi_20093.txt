Gene Pool: In Gene Pool we follow police detectives Ed Bundy and John Hackman as they investigate the kidnapping of a young girl Megan and her brother by a misguided scientist. As the detectives investigate Megan's kidnapping they find that the scientist has been conducting genetic experiments on humans and is creating monsters. What's worse is that there is an organization bigger than just this one geneticist engaged in the same type of experiments. Can the detectives find the lair of this organization and put an end to their experiments before more innocent people are transformed?
