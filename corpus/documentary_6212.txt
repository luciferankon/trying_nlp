The live on the road of a group of irish people is shown in great detail. Although they are real irish and no gypsies they live like gipsys on the road and with all the troubles this form of living brings with it. The historical backround is told in their own words and tales and in historical data. Wherever they go people turn away and try to block even roadsides where they used to stay overnight in their trailers. Their very modest style of living is financed by simple work like melting copper out of used wires (by burning them) or making buckets. Traditional stories show that their lives had alsways been hard since they took on the road in the last century. Beatifully and touching traditional songs transport those stories. Travelers have wandered the Irish countryside for centuries. They were tinsmiths harvesters and migrant laborers fortune- and story-tellers horse-traders and peddlers knife grinders and scrap dealers always performing a welcome chore for the settled society. As the centuries went by the so called tinkers adjusted their lifestyle to the changing conditions. Today however their traditional life on the road is coming to an end. "Rules of the Road" is a contemporary road movie forgoing the familiar clich√© of romantic escape. Instead it focuses on Irish travelers who not only herald a sweeping economic migration but also are the living exponents of an odyssey. An odyssey reflecting the state of mind in an absolute industrial society. The Irish travelers have no place to go. And they never had a place there they could stay.
