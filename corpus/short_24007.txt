Strikingly captivating and accessible short film by someone who tends to make more experimental and raw films even though the situation in the film is raw enough as it is. We follow Piling a young soccer fanatic through a slum district of Manila. No ball or cleats but a Coke can and flip-flops are the ingredients for a virtuoso demonstration of the football art. Only at the end does it become apparent why the little ball juggler will never be a Ronaldinho.
