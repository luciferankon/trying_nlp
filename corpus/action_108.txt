The Gang is a study in the paranoia of power. Following an unspecified job involving an international gang of crooks Frankie the Londoner is killed by the gang leader Marquez. But this death-in full view of the gang- is not what it seems. For Frankie had been forewarned and manages to fake his own death. The story then starts with a bang and continues at breakneck speed with Frankie wreaking revenge on the gang as he tries to find out who betrayed him. The story lurches from one corner of Europe to another pulling in Frankie's old London gang. Meanwhile Marquez jumps to a false conclusion that this gang had reacted to Frankie's death and is hellbent on teaching Marquez a lesson. The stage is set for a showdown in Marquez' fortress in the Canaries where the paranoia is ratcheted up and the body count reaches Shakespearian proportions.
