In this episode of Anatomy of a Show LNTV follows Big Grams as they prepare for their performance at NYC's Irving Plaza. With the goal of creating an unforgettable live experience the band implemented interactive human motion video synthesizer technology-each member stands in front of a giant screen that mimics their motions and broadcasts it to the audience as a design varying from song to song displaying psychedelic images to match the setlist.
