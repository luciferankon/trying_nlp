In 1988 Nagorno-Karabakh's war for independence was in the headlines worldwide. Halfway across the world in Canada Hagop Goudsouzian's peaceful world was suddenly shaken: "I had forgotten I was Armenian until I saw the courage of these people who had never forgotten who they were and knew what they had to do..." says Goudsouzian. Then again in 1991 the independence of Armenia triggered a new beginning for Hagop Goudsouzian. At this point he no longer had a choice he embarked on his life's most important adventure to touch this mythical land in search of his roots. "ARMENIAN EXILE" travels with Goudsouzian for his first meeting with Armenia in search of the ultimate connection with his forgotten and sometimes ignored identity. "ARMENIAN EXILE" is a deliberation seeking clarity where history left off.
