An epic tale of Dragons Dungeons Wizards Warriors and close-harmony singing. Scod a wizard Yon a priest and Gatesy a warrior who dreams of being a bard embark on a quest to map a secret place. Will these idiots finish their quest? Maybe. Will there be unexpected consequences? Probably. An all-too ambitious gloriously lo-fi adventure. Anyone who thought this was a good idea was living in a fantasy world.
