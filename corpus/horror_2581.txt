Halloween weekend. A jilted groom. A hastily-organized canoe trip. A pristine river. A deep dark forest. The strange old woman behind the bait shop should've been a warning but too much beer dulls the senses. When they stumble upon four beautiful women deep in the woods it all seems too good to be true. And slowly they realize they'll be lucky to escape alive... Witches' Night is a throwback to the horror classics of the 1970's and features many of the same elements: well-rounded characters titillating sexual scenarios an indelible villain and a plot that builds slowly and inexorably toward an unforgettable conclusion.
