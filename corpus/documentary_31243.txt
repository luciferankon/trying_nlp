Two people fall in love even though the conventions of society and culture say they shouldn't. Margareth and Eric belong to Kenyan families from different ethnic backgrounds. While Eric has no doubts about the institution of marriage Margareth is more orientated towards the West. She increasingly feels the need to make her own decisions about her life and wants an equal position in the marriage. Despite all the circumstances this is a vivacious portrait of "impossible" love.
