The drive-in's peak came in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Families could bring young kids with them while teenagers found drive-ins ideal for dates. During the 1970s some producers started shooting exploitation films directly for the drive-in market which would pair them with better films in double bills. Complete with authentic drive-in intermissions and ads this DVD is a sure-fire party hit!
