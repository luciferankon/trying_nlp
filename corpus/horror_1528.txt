Simeon five of his fellow inmates and the prison guards assigned to them have found themselves trapped in the inescapable confines of T-block during the lockdown. Boundaries of trust are pushed to the limit as the survivors must learn to work together if they have any hope of escaping the horde of infected and the deadly secret that lies within Twin Tower's walls. "We're Alive: Lockdown" serves as both a standalone and continuation of the "We're Alive: A Story of Survival" series. It answers questions asks new ones and keeps the listener guessing right up until the bitter end. What is "Audio Theater for the Mind"? Think of it a type of show that you can play in your head guided by the narrative but carried by your imagination.
