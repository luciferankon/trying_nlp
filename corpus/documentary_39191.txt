Perhaps no refereeing decision in the history of football has been the subject of so much controversy: when England was given a third goal in the 1966 World Cup final against Germany did the ball actually cross the line or not? For this documentary Manfred Oldenburg was awarded the Bavarian Television Prize in 2007. It is the 101st minute of the World Cup final which is well into extra time. The score is 2:2 when the English player Geoffrey Hurst volleys the ball against the underside of the crossbar of the German goal; it bounces vertically downwards and then back into play. The Swiss referee Dienst decides to award a goal. The final is over and England are the champions. For 40 years it is impossible to find a camera perspective that clarifies the question of whether the ball really was over the line or not. But thanks to new spectacular footage which has been found along with improved scientific calculations this 45-minute documentary is finally able to shed light on the most painful defeat in German football history.
