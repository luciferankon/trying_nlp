It tells the story of a group of people in Munich (mostly music and film students). Every episode focuses on a different character from the group although the main storyline and character the young composer Hermann continues. The movie tells a story in many different levels about love friendship misfortune loss art politics history with important historic events of the decennium in the background. It was the most costly and ambitious drama production in German television although very cinematographic. Believed to be partly autobiographic.
