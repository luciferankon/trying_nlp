In the patriotic fervor of the days and months following September 11th no corporation more accurately personified George W. Bush's dual philosophies of down-home family values and war without end than did Hubristic Systems Management. The oddball arms manufacturer most noted for its emphasis on handcrafting and artisanship in military grade weapons was led by Tristan Stanfield one of the nation's most sincere and colorful CEOs. But Hubristic's success was not to last. The proceeding years saw a series of increasingly bizarre public relations nightmares plunge Mr. Stanfield and the company into chaos. In the midst of the collapse was David Milken a first time documentary film maker. This is the story of the much publicized collapse of Hubristics as told from within. David's tapes provide an unflinching look at the realities of the highest echelons of corporate culture and take you behind the tabloids to offer a first-hand account of the tragic psychological collapse of one man's American dream.
