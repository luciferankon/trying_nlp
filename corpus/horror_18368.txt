In a small populated town located in Cyphers County there's a quaint crew of newscasters at Action 13 News. Dalton Law (John Kasper) the beloved local weatherman never missed a day of work or misguided his towns people to imperfect forecasts. Daltons days are predictable down to his morning coffee and daily bathroom run-ins with anchorman Dan Anders (Mike Gavern). However this particular day in Cyphers County is not so predictable. Dalton predicts an acid rain storm this evening but does not predict his unfortunate meeting of Holley Cooper (Dominique Capone) the new intern at Action 13 News. Holley unbeknownst to the news station crew is a recovering psychopath on her way to becoming a lead weatherman or should we say "weatherwoman". Holley intrigued by Dalton in more ways that one sheepishly asks him to meet up after work to discuss tips on how to become the best weatherman possible. Dalton agrees willingly but little does he know that his evening is ending differently that he anticipates. A few drinks in and Dalton's ego rises beyond what any woman can handle and all of Holley's progress suddenly goes down the drain.... The next morning Dalton awakens ...dirty bloody and confused. His once unquestionable priority to go to work has been erased. Now Dalton is here for revenge and must kill anyone that gets in his way.
