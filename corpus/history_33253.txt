Pivovarov's documentary is about the soldiers of the Brest Fortress which was the first to stand in the way of the Nazi blitzkrieg in June 1941. The selfless defense of the fortress and the writing on the wall "I'm dying but not giving up. Farewell to Motherland" is a historical fact. There is another fact a shocking one. Heroism of the defenders of the Brest Fortress could well remain outside the official Soviet history because almost all of the few survivors were captured by the Germans and Stalin said explicitly "We have no prisoners. There are just traitors."
