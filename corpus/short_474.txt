The shift in our way of thinking and how we see the world as a result of technical and social change becomes strikingly tangible in the ubiquitous phenomenon of reflections. The film presents fascination and fear our superstition and thirst for knowledge from ancient myths to the technoid 21st century. BEYOND THE MIRROR RIM is the last part of my perception trilogy. Words sounds and pictures seem to be independent disconnected as the appearance of light shadow and reflexion themselves if you begin to explore them.
