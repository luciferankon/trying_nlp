Las Sinsombrero seeks to recover the memory of the Spanish women writers artists and philosophers of the golden generation of 1927. Due to the overt chauvinism of this period these women have all but been eradicated from the cultural history of their country. This documentary seeks to pull them from out of the shadows and demonstrate the exceptional creative abilities and talents they possessed. Most of the women created there most important works in exile in Latin America and the US.
