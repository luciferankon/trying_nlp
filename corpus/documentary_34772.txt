The Internal Ear is a piece on improvisation but there is more to it; it is also a tale about different musicians and different individuals meeting in the creative process. An artist as original and open-minded as Mikolaj Trzaska deserves an unconventional portrayal. The makers of "The Internal Ear" seek a language that would allow to capture both the greatness of improvised jazz and the musical philosophy of one the best contemporary Polish clarinet and saxophone players who performed side by side with some of the greatest stars of jazz.
