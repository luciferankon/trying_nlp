This Gene Autry entry was sold to the exhibitors as a "Special" (a term used about once a production season when Republic wanted to charge the exhibitors a higher fee than usual for an Autry film) and finds "Rancho Grande foreman Gene Autry more than a little distressed when he learns that the heirs of the ranch siblings Kay Patsy and Tom Dodge are on their way. The young Dodges have a nation-wide reputation as wild irresponsibles and Gene already has his hands full trying to save the ranch from foreclosure. Before his death the late John Dodge had mortgaged the ranch in order to secure funds for a vast irrigation system which must be completed by a certain date or face foreclosure from the Citrus Valley Association. Kay and Tom Dodge show up with intentions of turning the property into a pleasure resort for their eastern society friends and they are encouraged in this by Dodge family attorney Emory Benson who also happens to be a heavy stockholder in the Citrus Valley Association and will profit greatly if the Dodges are unable to meet their obligations. To ensure this will happen Benson also hires some henchies to dynamite the irrigation project. But hey not to worry this isn't the first time (nor the last) that Gene has faced the problem of impudent heirs taking bad advice. Gene's late boss Dodge has left his ranch to his son and two daughters and Gene has to try and change their dislike for the west. But Gene faces a bigger problem as Benson is after the ranch and is out to see that the pipe line being built to bring in water is not completed thereby ruining the Dodge's financially.
