In the Mexican town of Oaxaca Adalberto's wife Rosario slams the door on their twenty-year marriage and leaves to live with her sister in Australia. The day of her departure her nearly-blind old uncle - in a hospice for the dying - wins the lottery. Misogynist Adalberto puts on a wig and a dress and 'becomes' Rosario in hopes of inheriting the money. But the uncle's notary finds another niece and the newly-minted 'Rosario' must prove herself the more deserving heir. Ambition gets sidetracked as Adalberto attempts to win the contest by caring for an abandoned child and ends up playing grandmother to a six-year-old version of himself.
