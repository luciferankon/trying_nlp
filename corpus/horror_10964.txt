Dr. Warren Chapin is a pathologist who regularly conducts autopsies on executed prisoners at the State prison. He has a theory that fear is the result of a creature that inhabits all of us. His theory is that the creature is suppressed by our ability to scream when fear strikes us. He gets a chance to test his theories when he meets Ollie and Martha Higgins who own and operate a second-run movie theater. Martha is deaf and mute and if she is unable to scream extreme fear should make the creature which Chapin has called the Tingler come to life and grow. Using LSD to induce nightmares he begins his experiment. After much hard work a pathologist discovers and captures a creature that lives in every vertebrate and grows when fear grips its host. "Scream for your lives!" The coroner and scientist Dr. Warren Chapin is researching the shivering effect of fear with his assistant David Morris. Dr. Warren is introduced to Ollie Higgins the relative of a criminal sentenced to the electric chair while making the autopsy of the corpse and he makes a comment about the tingler-effect to him. Ollie asks for a lift to Dr. Warner and introduces his deaf-mute wife Martha Higgins who manages a theater of their own. Dr. Warner returns home where he lives with his unfaithful and evil wife Isabel Stevens Chapin and her sweet sister Lucy Stevens. Dr. Warner upset with the situation with his wife threatens and uses her as a subject of his experiment. When Martha dies of fear Dr. Warner makes her autopsy and finds a creature that lives inside every human being feeds with fear and is controlled by the scream. Once Martha was not able to scream the tingler was not rendered harmless and became enormous. When the living being escapes Dr. Warner and Ollie chase it in a crowded movie theater.
