Chronicling the changing fortunes of a unique abandoned lot in Red Hook Brooklyn A Hole in a Fence explores the complicated issues of development class and identity facing the city's most populous borough. It's the story of a vanished homeless community and the young architect who documented it; of a real urban farm run by local kids amidst a landscape of industrial decay; of young graffiti writers losing their stomping grounds; of the arrival of a controversial Ikea megastore; of a photographer's vision of nature's renewal; of the doomed struggle to save a rare part of the neighborhood's working waterfront; and of a filmmaker's discovery of a fleeting hidden world on the other side of a rusty old fence.
