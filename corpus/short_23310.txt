The characters in my film are boys who have been conditioned to believe in the rituals of manhood given by an ideological masculinity. They express ideas of labor exhibitionism competition and a search for male intimacy. Through these interwoven narratives we begin to question where reality is anchored by the highlighting of masculine activities through playful and absurd set design paralleling the feelings a young boy may have in being trapped by the unrealistic masculine identities projected by media and the men they look up to.
