September 2013. The Court ruling is reached. Almost a quarter million Dominicans of Haitian descent have just become stateless because of the Dominican Constitutional Tribunal's decision. Identified as scapegoats for all the problems affecting the country they have lost everything: their rights their liberty their identity. Presented as a tale and narrated by Haitian poet and playwright Jean-Claude Martineau this film takes us to the very heart of the human drama lived by these migrants who have sacrificed everything to follow their dream of freedom.
