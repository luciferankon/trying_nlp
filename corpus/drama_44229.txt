The vital idea behind the film 'Album' is the protagonist's attempt to re-establish a normal post-war life searching for family photographs lost in the war on the territory of former Yugoslavia. In this poetic film essay writer Miroslav Kirin is making an attempt at reconstructing a family album with photos destroyed in the war when his family was forced to leave their home in occupied Petrinja. After the war he finds unusual 'compensation': having returned instead of his family photographs he finds an undeveloped negative left by the unknown Serbian family who lived in his house during occupation. Ironically and emotionally these photos become a part of his family album.
