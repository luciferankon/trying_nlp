This series on the Animal Planet cable network is a talent show for pets. Ten pet owners have their pets perform a specific trick. Among the contestants on the first show were a roller skating macaw; a dog that plays hockey a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig that painted pictures with a brush and a girl who hypnotized her pet frog. Each pet/owner team is rated on a scale of 1-10 by three celebrity judges (with new judges each week). The three teams with the highest scores are finalists; the winner is chosen by a vote of the audience. The winning owner receives $2500 and is eligible for the end-of-season finals and a chance to win $25000. Pet Star is a weekly hour-long animal talent show. Each week a group of pets and their owners will show off their unique talents and compete against other gifted animals onstage in front of a studio audience. The winners from each week will receive a cash award and an invitation to be a part of the final showdown where all weekly winners will compete for $25000 in cash and prizes.
