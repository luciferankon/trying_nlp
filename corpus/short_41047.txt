Each summer residents of Lake County California get together for 'The Fiberglass 500' a race in which people pull old beat up boats around a race track with their demolition derby cars trying to rip each others boats to shreds! Last man (or woman) standing wins. Award winning documentary filmmakers John Beck and Don R. Lewis spend a day at the races and bring you 'Drag King.'
