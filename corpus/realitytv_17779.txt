Blastazoid chronicled the lives of the hosts Brandon DiCamillo Rake Yohn and Joe Frantz (of the CKY Crew from the CKY videos Viva La Bam Bam's Unholy Union Haggard etc) as they brought to life "Live Action Donkey Kong" a life-sized five story version of the 1982 classic Nintendo video game. Blastazoid featured stunts and pranks reminiscent of predecessors Viva La Bam and the CKY videos (such as the "wake up" on Rake Yohn and the "waterfall barrel" gag. Blastazoid also showcased user-created gaming fan and tribute footage found on the Internets.Although the Blastazoid episode ended with a "trailer" for "Live-Action Frogger" the teaser was a spoof and Blastazoid had never been intended for a series.
