GRIEFWALKER is an extraordinary portrait of Harvard-trained theologian Stephen Jenkinson who teaches that death empowers us to live and that we must know grief well in order to appreciate our own lives. Many may find Jenkinson's belief that our deaths are not something to be denied or avoided but 'befriended' as challenging; he points out that not every culture fears death as we do. The film carries viewers into the lives of those confronting death as well as those learning how to help people die well. Combining beautiful imagery of the impermanence of nature and the actuality of dying GRIEFWALKER weaves an illuminating picture of a remarkable man and leaves us with a deeper understanding of how our deaths could be held as 'a prized possession.'
