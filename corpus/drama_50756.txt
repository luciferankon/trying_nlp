A man with momentary doubt about his life met his muse in the form of a young girl whose naivety and freshness awakens his curiosity-lost again - and also his vision as a filmmaker. He begins this fragile connection to document on film as well as his subtle seduction attempts. In between he seeks advice from his female alter ego in the form of a mature visitor - who has to tell their own sad love stories. Also on board is just as it did in the previous films Andersens the incomparable eccentric Polish actress / director Malga Kubiak with the questionable Penglisch skills.
