Manik (Hassan Manik) is an elderly man who is challenged by harsh realities of this ever changing world. Coming from a middle-class background his life has always revolved around his work and he takes pride in being self-sufficient. His identity has always been defined by what he does for a living. When Manik is suddenly forced into retirement he finds himself completely lost. Rather than wallow in self pity he decides to rediscover himself by reconnecting with his druggy daughter he has forsaken for so many years.
