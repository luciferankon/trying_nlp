In this short National Safety Council film the perfect crime is presented as excess speed. Accidents at high speed often results in deaths and are rarely investigated like the robbery of a corner grocery shown at the beginning of the film. Driving too fast particularly in poor weather conditions or at night can be deadly. Then there are those who don't properly maintain their vehicle. Alcohol is a problem. Even bad roads railway crossings and narrow underpasses are the driver's responsibility as they should slow down. The film ends with a plea to support the costs of new modern roads.
