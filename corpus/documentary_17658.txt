Take a trip with visionary music-promoter Rocco Somazzi to hear a mind-blowing collection of talent at the first-ever Angel City Jazz Festival in Los Angeles. Staging it at the funky Barnsdall Art Park and employing a crew of downtown LA's finest "live-painters" to riff off of the music Rocco uses his skills as a world-class curator - along with some old-fashioned hustle - to create what is truly an amazing blend of sounds and sights.
