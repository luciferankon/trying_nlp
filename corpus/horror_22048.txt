Two pretty but ditsy American girls are on a road trip through Europe. In Germany they end up alone at night with a broken car in the woods. They search for help and find an isolated villa. The next day they awaken to find themselves trapped in a terrifying makeshift basement hospital along with a Japanese man. An older German man identifies himself as a retired surgeon specialized in separating Siamese twins. However his three "patients" are not about to be separated but joined together in a horrific operation. He plans to be the first person to connect people via their gastric systems. By doing so he plans to bring to life his sick lifetime fantasy the human centipede. In Germany two American women and a Japanese man fall victim to a demented surgeon who plans to recreate a horrific operation with humans that he performed on his three beloved dogs: reverse-engineering Siamese triplets by attaching their digestive systems. Americans Lindsay and Jenny are on vacation traveling through Europe. In Germany they meet a waiter who invites them to a party in a nightclub called Bunker. They rent a car but they get lost on a lonely road in the woods. When they have a flat tire they do not replace the tire and prefer to seek for help instead. They reach a house where they are received by a psychopathic mad scientist named Joseph Heiter who drugs them. When Lindsay and Jenny awake they find that they are tied to a bed in a laboratory in the basement of the house. Sooner Dr. Heiter brings a Japanese tourist named Katsuro and introduces himself as a former surgeon specialized in separating Siamese twins. Further he details his insane project of creating a human centipede by joining three human beings through their mouths and anuses.
