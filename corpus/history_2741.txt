ADVENTURE Jewish heroes and anti-Nazis Georges Mora and Marcel Marceau meet in the French Resistance in Nazi Occupied France and in Vichy France. They immediately become fast friends and help Jewish children avoid Auschwitz by taking them across borders or on ships to safety. The two young men have many clandestine adventures in the process of saving children and inflicting damage on the Nazi occupiers. As Jews they are in particular danger if ever caught and have false identities supplied by the Resistance. Mora's codename is Monsieur Mayonnaise because he notices Nazis will not touch baguettes oozing with mayonnaise so he informs the Resistance to put all ID in wax paper and baguettes and lay on the mayonnaise. Marceau's codename is Silence based on his innate ability to mime. Meanwhile in many close shaves Marceau mimes to the children to calm them down before dangerous escapes and treks to safety. Sometimes the two men dress as nuns to give the Nazis the impression the kids are Cathoilc children on a scouting hike and they use many other ruses. After the war Georges falls in love with one of Marceau's mime students Mirka and they get married. Marceau becomes a legendary mime. Years later Marceau tells Georges' son Philippe the whole story and tells him to make a film about it.
