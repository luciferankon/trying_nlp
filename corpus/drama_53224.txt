He has a new chance at a new life but is it worth the cost? Ryan is not unlike millions of people - fresh out of college a dead-end job and an endless search for meaning in his life. Offered a new start via a self-help group simply known as The Center and their highly charismatic leader Vincent Ryan soon finds himself enmeshed in a world that seemingly offers him hope. But there is a dark side to everything and The Center has many secrets. Charlie Griak's debut feature paints a fascinating and tense portrait of desperation and those that prey upon it.
