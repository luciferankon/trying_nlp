On July 15 1867 Benito Juárez entered Mexico City victoriously after four years of running the itinerant republican and constitutional government for the country which at that time had been invaded. With his famous saying - ''among individuals as among nations respect for the other's rights is peace'' Juárez sealed the republic's victory and the consolidation of Mexican nationality. At the same time he topped off a life that was fully devoted to his homeland and respect for the rule of law.
