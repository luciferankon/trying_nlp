Hare Krishna has been in America for over 50 years; Leonardo or Nrisimha-kripa das as his spiritual name is has been a devotee for 14 years now. He is established in a small town in Guanajuato (Mexico) called Cuer√°maro where he lives with his wife and son in a Krishna consciousness community. We follow him to take a closer look to his daily life and see how he combines the different roles he has as a father husband member of a community and as an individual devotee. Currently Nrisimha considers himself to be over the first stage of Krishna awareness he has learned all he had to. "Now I'm on a deeper dimension in my journey I still have a lot to go though but it's an interior dimension I feel I don't have to look for anything else in matters like philosophy or knowledge that might be done; now what I have to do is inside me" (Nrisimha 2015). He is also facing a new stage of his physical life along with his wife Keli; they have son Kirtan and now they have a new huge responsibility: raise a human as their religion establishes in a world full with obstacles where they represent a minority and even more in a mostly catholic country.
