Serenity of the Smokies is a passion project for artist Willy Adkins. Adkins began the project back in 2006 with the ultimate goal of publishing a coffee table photo book featuring the natural beauty of The Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Since beginning the project it has now grown to include a feature length DVD and also a soundtrack CD both featuring original music by Dc McAuliffe.
