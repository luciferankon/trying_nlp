At the end of his studies Sébastien young engineer started to realize his dream: create and build up a completely new plane. In the North of France he has created his own company with the view of developing a biplane flying at 400 km per hour and covering the distance of 1 000 km using less that 30 liters of petrol. Around him a team of young graduates and trainees try to resolve technical problems while the shareholders follow very carefully the developments of the project. The difficulties are increasing: will the plane be flying one day? Will the shareholders continue to invest in the necessary adjustments? Within just a few months Sébastien will have both become aware of the business world and have left his position of young engineer to become a company manager.
