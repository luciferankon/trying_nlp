Prague faces the challenge of a new zoning plan. The city's development leads to conflicts between the private developer lobby city residents and elected officials. By following several years of town council meetings the film paints an image of a public policy apparatus that ignores the role of the urban planner. Using a journalistic approach the filmmaker attempts to depict the all points of view although in the end the dominant perspective is of those who believe in the city as an expression of culture and quality of life.
