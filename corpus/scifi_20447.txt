It is the year 2279. Two hundred years ago most of the Earth's remaining population chose to travel deep into space to colonize a new planet. This New Earth quickly became a disease and conflict-free Utopia. Those who wished to lead a grass-roots technologically-light lifestyle stayed behind to take their chances on the original Earth Terra Antiquis. New Earth has picked up a rudimentary SOS signal. The origin? Terra Antiquis. Six crew members are deployed in response to this call for help. But when they arrive - the crew finds something wildly different then what they expected. This discovery turns their quest into a dangerous journey to understand where they actually came from and who they have become.
