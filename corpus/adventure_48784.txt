Experience a ghost hunt with the paranormal investigators from the hit Canadian TV show THE OTHER SIDE. Explore an abandoned hospital with team leader Jeff Richards as your guide and use the tools our First Nations investigators use including sage and sweet grass smudges. Protect yourself from the dark spirits that lurk here while you piece together the stories of the lost souls who still haunt the space and help them pass safely over to the other side.
