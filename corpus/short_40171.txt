Two shambling elderly villagers Betty and Sam cut thorny hedges for pennies and push a ragged old pram with them wherever they go. They make a pact with the snide village undertaker Chorn for him to scatter the prams ashes on their grave once they are both dead and gone. Chorn agrees taking all of the old couples' savings in return for the favour but when Betty and Sam eventually have passed away Chorn decides to sell off the pram to the scrapyard but the night before the pram is due to leave Chorn's warehouse it comes to life and rolls to the cemetery and cremates itself to fulfill Betty and Sam's wishes. A fireball blasts out of the grave and soars into the night sky with Chorn's warehouse as its destination.
