Dan Bell Will Krupinsky and Rick Serra revisit the scene of the grime at the disgusting Swan Motel in Halethorpe MD. Until they inspected Detroit's notorious Royal Inn this is the worst motel room they had ever visited. In a series dedicated to discovering America's nastiest motel and hotel rooms that's really saying something. This "Check Out Time" not only adds highlights to the blacklights with commentary but includes bonus footage of the crazy lady who stopped by as well. This addition to the "Check Out Time" series is a companion piece to the corresponding "Another Dirty Room 11" short.
