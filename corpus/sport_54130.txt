Taped at the UIC Pavillion in Chicago Illinois the second Great Skate Debate featured the first competition ever judged live by people at home via the Internet. The scoring was based on the calculation of two scores: those tallied via the Internet by people at home and those scored by hand-held computers by those in attendance in the arena. Both a mens' and womens' competitions were judged in this 2-hour CBS Prime-Time Special.
