War Hero and newly-appointed Minister of Domestic Security General Roger Workman enlists the help of a fringe Terrorist group to cause chaos in order to show Canadians just how real the threat is at home as he prepares to introduce a controversial Anti-Terror Bill. With firm contention from the current Prime Minister and the obstacle of Toronto's Counter-Terrorism branch of CSIS the plan is quickly intercepted but not strictly because of these factors. Workman's near-perfect plan to use fear as his selling point is threatened by someone he didn't account for - Rogue CSIS Field-Operative Josh Reed. As Josh uncovers intelligence leading to the Terrorist group after they attack a public venue Workman hastily tries to cover his tracks. With CSIS Josh and the ambitious Prime Minister in his way will General Workman's plan unravel or will it drastically alter the Canadian landscape forever?
