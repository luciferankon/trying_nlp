Once a year on the first weekend after Halloween a colorful ceremony takes place at the Cemetery of the Nameless in Vienna Austria. Hundreds of people gather there to commemorate those who lost their lives in the river Danube and who between 1840 and 1940 did not receive a proper burial. Suicide poverty and fishing accidents ranked among the most frequent causes of death. The central figure of this documentary is the chief "Guardian of the Nameless" Josef Fuchs. He volunteers to maintain to cemetery as part of his family tradition that has now existed for three generations and shows no signs of abating.
