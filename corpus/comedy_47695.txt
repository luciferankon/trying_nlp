Sergey believes he knows everything about his wife Olga after fifteen years of married life. She is a good housewife and mother but she has become dull and uninteresting over time like a book that has been read from cover to cover. So to spice up his life a little Sergey signs up on a dating website and starts a virtual romance with a mysterious stranger called Emma. This impetuous virtual relationship soon grows into a real one. The lady is smart and very seductive and the fact that she hides her face and prefers dating in the dark inflames Sergey even more. Compared to the boring Olga Emma is mysterious and irresistibly attractive. But when she eventually "throws off the mask" Sergey is shocked to discover that he has been having a romance with his own wife.
