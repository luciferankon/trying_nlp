A local T.V. talk show host Drayton Taylor who dreams of making it big and finally lands an interview of a lifetime that is sure to gain him national exposure. The combination of his nervousness and some well-meaning co-workers who offer him sedatives (among other things) to calm his nerves get the best of Drayton and this proves disastrous. Needless to say the interview goes horribly wrong causing Drayton to lose his job and consequently all his possessions as news of the interview hits the airwaves. To make matters worse Drayton receives a phone call from an Attorney that his Grandma Sadie who lived in Austin Texas has passed away and left him a special gift. Drayton flies off to pay his final respects and to claim his inheritance. Upon arriving at what used to be Grandma Sadie's home he discovers an old abandoned Champion RV just sitting there practically rooted to the ground. Joshua Wright a trusted friend of Grandma Sadie helps Joshua to get the RV running again but just barely. During his journey back home to Georgia the RV breaks down several times driving Drayton to meet some oddly remarkable characters. Billy a mechanic with a voice for country music who has never had the opportunity to pursue his dream of making it big in Nashville TN. Savannah and Aaron doing all they can to save a struggling Vineyard. The ever so tough Sheriff all of 42 inches tall along with his two dimwitted Deputies. And the comical overseeing ever-watching GOOD and BAD Conscience. Grandma's Blessings is a funny film with a feel good theme. So come take the ride with Drayton who gains some much needed perspective experiences some earth shattering drama and gets a little high... on life that is... All courtesy and with the love of Grandma's Blessings!
