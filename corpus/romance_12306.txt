Lucinda has to live with and try to bear her aged Aunt Emerald. But Emerald's tastes for salmon and costly drinks are hard to sustain on Lucinda's pittance from Mr. Swyvoski's antique shop; so they have to take lodgers. Mr. Trace asks only to be left in peaceful enjoyment of his role being a failure but bold Phelim O'Donnell Irishman and drunk virtuoso is a very different kettle of poteen and his arrival marks the beginning of a life which is fuller (particularly in the alcoholic sense) for the bewildered Lucinda.
