The story takes place in today's Ghana. According to the TROKOSI customary practice if someone commits a crime traditional leaders order that a young girl from that family be sent to the shrine as a form of atonement. The chief priest and his entourage genitally mutilate and sexually abuse the girls. Against all odds the protagonist of the story escapes the shrine. As the film follows her life from the age of innocence to premature adulthood the viewers get to see a beautiful showcase of the real and very animated African life in a typical village.
