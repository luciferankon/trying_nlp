Nuclear weapons production and nuclear power plant operation continue to irreversibly damage our environment and human health. In the 1980's citizens' groups worldwide were responding by organizing nuclear free zones in their communities. By the film's release in 1989 more than 4200 Free Zones existed in 37 countries. Over 17 million Americans lived in Nuclear Free Zones - including New York Chicago and Berkeley California. FREE ZONE documents this vital movement and the challenges which confronted it then...and continue to confront it now. With nuclear non-proliferation back on the Obama Administration's table this still-relevant documentary provides empowering historical background on today's nuclear challenges. Internationally broadcast.
