Based on the "Little Iodine" two-panel cartoon strip by Jimmy Hatlo which had evolved from his "They'll Do It Everytime" strip Little Iodine was the most-scheming kid in comics aside from Hans and Fritz of the "Katzenjammer Kids" and "The Captain and the Kids" strips. She played by Jo Ann Marlowe stays true to form most of the way in this picture where she does her best to break up the marriage of her parents (Hobart Cavanaugh and Irene Ryan) ruin a romance between Eve Whitney and Marc Cramer and cost her father his job. But unlike her comic-based character Iodine has a change of heart and sets out to right the wrongs.
