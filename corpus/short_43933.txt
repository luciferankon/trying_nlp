In the Indian culture Menstruation is considered as a taboo. Women who are going through their monthly cycles are supposed to abide by certain rules and regulations laid by the society. Being a part of such a society Radha a native adolescent girl finds herself oscillating between two contrary thoughts as she is expected to conform to these social mandates which she finds traumatic. She expresses her hatred towards these norms to her grandmother. While her rebellious nature desires to protest against these discriminatingÂ practices her superego prevents her from doing so. She wonders about the hypocritical thoughts of the "society" which venerates a woman when she gives birth to a child but at the same time is shunned from religious functions or ceremonies when she goes through her menstrual cycles which are necessary for the very conception of a child. She finds herself witnessing a Cycle - a cycle of change which nature has bestowed upon every Woman. While she accepts the laws of nature she is also plagued with endless questions and thoughts about herself and her womanhood. Ganya Radha's younger sibling is narrating his secret observations as he sees her struggle through this Change. Although his curiosity makes him want to explore her condition it somehow confuses him.
