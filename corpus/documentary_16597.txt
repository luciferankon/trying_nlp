Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes was the most flamboyant and outspoken member of the most successful girl group in American music history. TLC was known for it's outlandish style and its unabashed flavor and "Left Eye" was the perfect showpiece spearheading the charge. The world lost one of its most unique talents on a winding road in Honduras just days before her 31st birthday. This film is a tribute to the life and career of the self-proclaimed Craziest member of TLC.
