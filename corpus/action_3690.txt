THE KING OF BLOODY FOOKIN' BRITAIN is an Action Crime Comedy about a working class Brit named "ROGER" (Derek Evans) who wants to be King- Literally. The likes of a Turtleneck Philosopher a Jawbreaker-Eating Sleaze-Bag and a Homosexual Psychic throw Roger's world into chaos when he and his gang of Misfits (Kasey O'Barr & John Burnett) decide it'd be "quite alright" to rip off the most vicious man in London.
