Mamba is new at school. The bosses are the members of the Heavy Metal band 'Smashers' and only the members of the Turkish HipHop band 'Fresh Family' are in opposition. Mamba does not want to be involved but has to make up his mind when he gets interested in Nadja the girl of Smashers boss Thommy. Meanwhile the new teacher Pilgrim is planning the play "Romeo and Juliet" which has certain parallels to what's happening at school.
