This documentary is about women's bodies and labor. In global capitalism many women are expelled to the peripheries of society where they are labeled housewives sex workers dispatched workers migrant workers homeless and so on. In the marginalized world of women their bodies have special meaning. A woman's body becomes a means of labor or a commodity itself. However sometimes it is regarded as tainted hence subject to moral judgment. 'Red Maria' aims to document these women's bodies that support the existence of global capitalism in the lowliest place thereby raising the question - from the perspective of women and labor - of what it means socially to 'work hard.'
