Canada's many animal species have adapted to a wide range of habitats. Some live on the outskirts of cities while others make their homes on the plains in waters and wetlands in mixed or boreal forests or on the tundra. Those habitats change with the seasons and the animals must adapt quickly to new climate conditions and the resulting changes in the food supply. For most species the living is easiest in spring summer and fall. But throughout most of Canada the cold reigns supreme for several months of the year. In the Arctic as in most Canadian provinces further south winter means snow and ice - and lots of it. With the approach of the cold season different species react in different ways. Some migrate southward while others adapt. It is on those that choose to stay that this 52-minute documentary will focus its attention.
