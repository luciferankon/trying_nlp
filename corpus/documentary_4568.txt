Isanga is the Swahili word that means "stand-off". This movie shows this stand-off through the story of this village and some extraordinarily appealing characters such as two young Masaai women a hunting guide of Greek originand a German missionary nurse. A chronicle between laughter and tears conflict and friendship nostalgia and hope. An optimist film image of Masaai people.
