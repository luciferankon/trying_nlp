In the mid 90's Erica Bergsmeds played the lead character in a TV Series at Swedish National TV network SVT. She dreamed of going to LA but ended up in a theatre school in New York. She always wondered what life in LA would have been like. When her best childhood friend Caroline Bruckner a talented screen writer was Oscar nominated last year Erica decided to go with her. She filmed Caroline and 4 other Swedes that live in LA. Finally she was about to see what a life in LA could have been like. In the film we follow Hollywood actress Malin Akerman's little sister Jennifer Akerman when she sings in a studio on a photo shoot on a roof and talks about her sister and shows us her home. We follow Caroline through Oscar ceremony prep. Chaos arises when Caroline has forgotten her ID card at the hotel room- without it she will not be let into the Oscar venue! We also follow 3 other Swedish actors to their agents film rehearsal a photo shoot in Venice beach a film screening and much more. The Swedes Erica met in LA shared a piece of their journey and destiny with her. They showed her that there is a good place in-between. It does not have to be all or nothing Oscar or no Oscar to feel personal success. The city of angels have an irresistible aura keep you head high with the aim on happiness. It is not about the goal but about the journey taking you there!
