Deep in the Pennsylvania hills a cemetery for those who died during exorcism remains a dark secret for the church. In 1671 hundreds of men women and children suffered in bloody torturous rituals at the hands of priests unable to contain the evil of the possessed. Were these possessions real or is the story a hoax to cover up the sins of the deranged priests thirsty for human blood? Bill and his team of cynical paranormal investigators plan to find out the truth. As the producer and host of the reality TV show "Ghost Seekers" Bill and his crew have seen it all: abandoned prisons haunted houses and decrepit mental hospitals. Night after night of boring trips to empty run down buildings has left them sure that the dead stay dead and that ghosts are the furthest thing from being real. Their lack of faith will soon be repaid in blood. Armed with the church's historical record they set out into the wilderness to uncover this series of forgotten atrocities. The demons of the past are invited to return and the gory details of old sins are revealed as the possessed begin hunting the living. Alternately gut-punching hilarious and brutally violent The Cemetery takes the best elements of the old-school slasher film and pushes them to the edge.
