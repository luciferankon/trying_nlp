<p>A valiant soldier wandering without cause or family after the Civil War accepts the Devil's challenge to go for seven years without washing himself; cutting his hair beard or nails; or reciting the Lord's Prayer in exchange for limitless wealth. Draped in the Devil's cloak and the skin of a bear the soldier travels the world reveling in his riches until his appearance and odor become repugnant to all and especially to himself. At that point the soldier learns to care about others and becomes the benefactor to a down-on-his-luck man who in return for the soldier's generosity offers one of his daughters in marriage. </p><p> -- Booklist</p><br><p>Winner of the American Film Festival Blue Ribbon The Parents Choice Award The American Library Association's "Notable Children's Film" </p>
