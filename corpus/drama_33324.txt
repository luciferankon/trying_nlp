The girl finally gets a job in a retirement home scrubbing floors and cleaning toilets. It is there that she develops a friendship with a widely-detested patient who is given special care due to his wealth and alleged former position. Marianna falls in love with an orderly Marek with whom she lives in a self-made shack and shares plans for the future. It seems like she has finally left the slums for good. When Marek is turned down for an apartment she tries to get the money but it's not going to be easy.
