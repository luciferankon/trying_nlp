I met Martin more than 3 years ago. He is probably the happiest man I have ever met. He has chosen to live under a bridge in the centre of Dublin for the last 4 years but has been living on the streets for 14. He doesn't consider himself homeless. This documentary examines how our friendship has developed and how two people from two very different walks of life interpret happiness.
