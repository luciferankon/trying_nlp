Ken and his sister are separated while young when the Indians attack their wagon train. Ken now grown is sent after the outlaw known as the Golden hair Girl only to find that she's his long lost sister. During an Indian raid the parents of young Ken Masters (Ken Maynard) are killed and his sister Gail abducted by a squaw Dove Grey. Gail has half of a map tattooed on her arm and Ken bears the other half. At the suggestion of Jed Forrest (William Gould) his father's best friend who has raised him from a child the now-grown-up Ken accepts a government commission to round up a gang of rustlers operating near the town of Red Dust. He and his men avert suspicion by traveling as members of a medicine show and Ken has reason to believe that the rustlers are led by a blonde-headed girl. In Red Dust Ken meets Mary Harper (Lucile Browne) when her kid brother Pee Wee (Buzz Henry) asks to ride Ken's horse Tarzan. While trailing the rustlers Ken is captured and a rustler Link (Frank Hagney) takes him prisoner to another town where Goldie (Nora Lane) has her headquarters. While tying up Ken Link discovers the section map on his arm and realizing that me must be Goldie's brother as he knows she also has such a mark plans on a scheme that will get him revenge on her as she as double-crossed him. He makes Goldie believe that Ken is out to get her and she orders her men to kill Ken the next morning. Mary and her brother are captured while searching for Ken but Pee Wee escapes and brings back Ken's riders. Ken escapes and runs into Dove Grey who seeing the mark on his arm also realizes who he is and tells Goldie that Ken is her brother. Ken returns and Goldie sacrifices herself to save him by stepping in front of a bullet fired by Link.
