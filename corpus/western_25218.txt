Pep Pepper is a romantic young cowboy whose propensity for daydreaming costs him his job. After reading the classic novel "Don Quixote" he decides to follow in that character's footsteps but things take a wrong turn when he intervenes in a saloon fight in which the owner is killed and Pep gets blamed for it. He escapes but must find the real killer and clear his name. On his search he finds his own Dulcinea--a wealthy cattleman's daughter named Tulip who has been kidnapped by a bandit gang.
