This is an informative and interesting documentary about the NG Photographers and what they do to get "the picture". It was made in 1998 but goes back further than that with anecdotes from the first publication of the magazine. Although I did not think their lives were "glamorous" I had no idea of how remote dangerous or heart rending some of their assignments were. I definitely recommend this DVD.
