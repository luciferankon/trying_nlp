In many Western democracies trust between the people and the politicians are at a low point while populist movements are on the rise. In Italy Movimento vows to send all politicians home and bring the people to power. They win a stunning 25% of the vote but what happens when political ideals meet parliamentary reality? Can you be uncompromising and democratic at the same time? Are internet referendums direct democracy or faceless mob rule? The film follows this democratic experiment. The Italian comedian and political activist Beppe Grillo cannot be seen on Italian state television and avoids Berlusconi's media empire Mediaset. He rather takes to the streets and fights political arrogance and corruption via the internet. His popular protest movement Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S Five Star Movement) promises voters to send all politicians home and bring the people to power. M5S win the national elections in 2013 with more than 25% of the votes and is the largest party in Italy with 163 people. How the inexperienced senators will realize their political ideals and electoral slogans in parliamentary reality is still the question. Can you be uncompromising and democratic at the same time? What do the internet referendums of Beppe Grillo's blog lead to? Does grass-root democracy really exist? 'Tutti a Casa' shows the shift in the balance between 'the people' and 'the political power' - a process that has taken place throughout Europe not just in Italy. The confidence in politicians has fallen to a low in many countries and populist parties are becoming increasingly popular. This documentary offers an intimate portrait of four senators and Movimento's first years in politics through unique images behind the scenes.
