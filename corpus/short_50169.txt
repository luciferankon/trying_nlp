The legend of Sea Beggars' Night when no man can stay awake and no lock can be fastened against the briny ghosts crowned in moss and barnacles who rise from the sea and slosh manfully into darkened homes - where trembling wives await - and cuckold every man as he sleeps. One Sea Beggar falls in love with the Parson's wife the town pervert who drains every drop of life from the undead and love-lorn spectre of the sea.
