In the coastal provinces of Kenya there is not much hope for children who are born with various disabilities. Children with hearing impairment physical disabilities or mental problems seldom get the best education and are often left behind. There people still kill children who are born with very small heads (microcephaly) because they believe that they cause droughts. But for Patrick Muzungo these are only challenges on the way to make these children happier and able to sustain themselves.
