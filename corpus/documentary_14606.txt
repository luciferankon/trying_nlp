Praised by audience and critics Florence and the Uffizi Gallery 3D/4K gained the first place of the Italian box office in the first two days of its theatrical release. A multidimensional and multisensory journey in the Florentine Renaissance through its most representative beauties where the latest-generation 3D and 4K technology and the most advanced techniques of modelling and dimensionalisation are put at the service of the national artistic heritage to valorise it and to export it all over the world. Rather than a classic art documentary Florence and the Uffizi Gallery 3D/4K is an art movie that has made its debut in 2.000 theatres of 60 countries.
