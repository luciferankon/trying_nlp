A month before his 95th birthday Archer King agreed to participate in a documentary about his long and extraordinary life in the entertainment industry. "Lunch With Archer King" is a loving and amusing journey of a one-man dynamo who grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. After working for Louis Shurr as an agent Archer branched out on his own in 1957 and continued to work well into his 95th year (2012). He held the longest theatrical franchise in the United States. With an innate sense of taste and wonder he discovered some of the most important actors - James Dean Ron Howard Martin Sheen and many more. He introduced Roman Polanski's "Knife In The Water" and other landmark foreign films to American audiences. Mr. King's enthusiasm for show business never diminished and his discerning and intuitive instinct was a talent that sustained his astonishing career.
