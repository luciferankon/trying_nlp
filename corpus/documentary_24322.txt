City Hall in Copenhagen is a gem in the Danish national romantic building tradition. Virtually untouched since the completion in 1905. But it was not an easy birth for the creative force behind the project Martin Nyrop. In the film we see both the architect sources of inspiration in Italy and his stubborn fight to retain his original idea of the structure. Town Hall spirits of both Nyrop sense of clear outline practical solutions to difficult design tasks and interest to even the smallest thing. The film is both a dramatic introduction to a magical universe and a fascinating portrait of an energy and tough slider in Danish architecture.
