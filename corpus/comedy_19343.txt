When perpetually disgruntled twentysomething Hunter Reeves is fired from a chain bookstore his best chance at regaining some semblance of financial security is by offering himself to Pharmakhem which despite being exactly the type of pharmaceutical conglomerate Hunter is prone to despise is paying good money for human test subjects. Along with his fellow unemployed friends Nicki and Greg Hunter agrees to set aside his most recent Noam Chomsky book and swallow an experimental anti-depressant. Unlike Prozac however this drug doesn't encourage proper brain chemistry as much as it induces stupidity. Ignorance really is bliss for Hunter; while he finds himself increasingly unconcerned with the state of the world he's also becoming progressively dumber.
