People keep on saying that masturbation makes you deaf to the extent that no one dares to have an opinion on the matter anymore... Using fiction to show two young modern people afraid of nothing this film deals with "self-pleasure" and its numerous representations. Manu and Emma our two heroes exchange their impressions on the blog "M... la maudite" whose colourful layout inspires all kinds of fantasies. Emma publishes her interviews with writers philosophers artists and doctors who provide a historical overview of the subject. Manu novice philosopher answers. To back up their words the director Jean-Paul Fargier leads us on a highly eclectic journey through art: from the elegant works of Rodin Klimt and Schiele to Dali's fantastical ravings from the provocative performances of the 1970s to the controversial stage productions of Jan Fabre from the realism of certain fiction works to modern comedies devoid of all hang-ups all the way up to the now commonplace sex toys... These intersecting views of self-pleasure show that masturbation continues to be an artistic and ideological issue.
