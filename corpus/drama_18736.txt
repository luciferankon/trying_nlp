Tom Everett can't believe that Death has come to collect another of his former students for a second time and in a way that could have been avoided if anyone could have seen what was right in front of them. Now he is put in the unfortunate position of explaining what happened before the shooting that could have possibly lead to that outcome. The Days Never Know is a multi-character drama that simultaneously examines the lives of six close friends the night they graduate high school as well as the days leading up to their ten year reunion; how one tragic event will irrevocably change their lives and set into motion a chain of events that will cause history to repeat itself.
