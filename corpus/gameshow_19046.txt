Early on in game shows when stars took part they aided players -- to guess secret words on "Password" for instance. Now they're helping them guess names of VIPs in host 'Craig Ferguson (I)' (qv)'s four-round competition set in a party atmosphere. The celebrity/contestant pairs must identify the famous -- actors athletes politicians cartoon characters etc. -- based on improvised clues for a chance to win $20000. The celebrity connection extends behind the cameras; actors 'Courteney Cox' (qv) and 'David Arquette (I)' (qv) are among executive producers of a show based on board game "Identity Crisis."
