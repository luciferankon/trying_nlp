For the first time in his life Christian Stock meets leprosy affected people in Nepal. All of them have to suffer not only from their disease or its long-term effects but from brutal social discrimination as well. A mostly uneducated population with almost no factual knowledge about the disease leaves only a dim hope of solving the problem in the near future. But still a lot of people in Nepal already give their best efforts to help the leprosy affected people and offer them a shot at what comes at least close to a normal life. The film approaches these stories from a very personal perspective and thereby discovers a world of people who have lost touch with the established society.
