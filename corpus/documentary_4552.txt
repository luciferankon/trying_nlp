James Picard is an artist with a new series of work that has a disturbing message and undertone. After being rejected from the galleries he usually displays his work he decides to put on art shows in old prisons and asylums. This decision also has a lot of challenges since those locations are typically closed to art shows. Since films are aloud to rent out the locations James creates a fake movie to pretend to film in the location so he can put on his art shows. He takes this show all over the country with his sights set on the best location for his work - Alcatraz.
