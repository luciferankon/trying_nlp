The series entitled Capek's Pockets represents a novel and unique student project in which talented young directors and experienced scriptwriters came together to produced their rendering of Tales from One Pocket and Tales from the Other Pocket by the outstanding Czech writer Karel Capek. Rather than experimenting with the model its authors sought to "put new life" into the classical piece of literature and commemorate Capek's great mastery as a writer and thinker. The tales with crime plots of a humorous slant are situated in the 1920s and 1930s and their protagonists are not big criminals but petty thieves or little crooks. And the detective is an ordinary man too. The main focus is always on capturing the diversity of personality types - people whom their life situation forces to deal with things the way they do.
