Featuring the life-long work of Social Engineer Futurist Inventor and Industrial Designer Jacque Fresco this presentation advocates a new socio-economic system that is updated to present-day knowledge which he calls a Resource-Based Economy. This documentary details the root causes of the systemic value disorders and detrimental symptoms caused by our current established system. It also details the need to outgrow today's dated and inefficient methods of politics law business or any other "establishment" notions of human affairs and to instead use the methods of science combined with high technology to provide for the needs of all the world's people. It is not based on the opinions of the political and financial elite or on illusionary so-called democracies but on maintaining a dynamic equilibrium with the planet that could ultimately provide abundance for all people. Paradise or Oblivion by The Venus Project introduces the viewer to a more appropriate value system required to enable this caring and holistic approach to benefit all of human civilization. This alternative surpasses the need for the monetary-based controlled and scarcity-oriented environment which we find ourselves in today.
