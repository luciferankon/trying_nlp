Two characters a woman and a man travel together but where they go what they see and even the exact nature of their relationship are unclear. The ephemeral images the floating soundtrack and the characters' subtle and sometimes playful dialogue move along the wayside reflecting on human moments of incidental connections. What do we observe? How do we have fun? And what do we remember in the transient waiting spaces we find ourselves suspended in? All that is left are fleeting traces that skirt around the edges of events and yet somehow remain.
