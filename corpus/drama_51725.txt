Reeling from the death of her animal researcher husband lawyer Anna Colden goes to trial to save Cindy - a gifted chimp who seems to have the intelligence of a 4 year old child - from a life lived as a medical experiment. For Anna to succeed she will have to completely revolutionize the way we think about animal sentience and personhood. This is a heartfelt story about communication between people and animals and between people and people. How do we cope when the things we most want to say must remain unsaid?
