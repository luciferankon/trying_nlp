In 1961 three young visionary architects were commissioned by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara to create Cuba's National Art Schools on the grounds of a former golf course in Havana Cuba. Construction of their radical designs began immediately and the school's first classes soon followed. Dancers musicians and artists from all over the country reveled in the beauty of the schools but as the dream of the Revolution quickly became a reality construction was abruptly halted and the architects and their designs were deemed irrelevant in the prevailing political climate. Forty years later the schools are in use but remain unfinished and decaying. Castro has invited the exiled architects back to finish their unrealized dream. Unfinished Spaces features intimate footage of Fidel Castro showing his devotion to creating a worldwide showcase for art and it also documents the struggle and passion of three revolutionary artists.
