Board Culture is a funny and realistic show everyone can enjoy. It features a great group of guys who have a strong presence and who are making some noise at national level contests and as hosts of professional demos. This will help push Moncton skateboarding to a greater level of recognition. These guys are not acting they don't play it up for the camera they are the real deal. They are skateboarders and they love it.
