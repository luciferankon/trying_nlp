How a father returns to his son after a long period in prison. Anxious to be reconciled with his child - who reproaches him for his absence (the mother having died in the interim) - the father tries to teach him some values and buys a piece of land in order to plant a vine. However the son totally rejects this paternal figure and the tension grows further when the father starts a relationship with his former wife's sister.
