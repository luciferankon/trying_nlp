An old worn-out photo album - Laini had certainly not wanted for her twelfth birthday. Not even the right motifs can be seen on some blurry photos. But after all it comes from her parents from Africa and is thus an important connection to her origin. Countless bottles have already thrown them into the Rhine but never get an answer back to this album. Her adoptive Henning and Anni try to make her start into a new life as simple as possible but still the girl often feels lonely in the strange environment. This is a special gift because on closer inspection Laini discovers numbers and strangely sounding words on the pages. What do they mean? Are they encrypted messages from their parents? Together with her new friends Paul and Michael she tries to solve the riddle and goes on a journey of discovery through Wiesbaden and into her own past. Die Flaschenpostinsel is a film about three children each of them looking for their personal definition of home and family. In a variety of ways they find each other and unite their abilities to interpret the indications on the way to the bottle depot. They recognize that the path is often more important than the goal and grow beyond the expectations of their parents and themselves.
