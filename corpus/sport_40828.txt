We will follow some of our most famous skiers throughout 2013 and 2014 up to the day of departure to Falun and World Cup 2015. We take part in their competitions training and in their own home environments where we get a glimpse of their everyday life. During the four programs of 60 minutes we will follow the participants until the World Cup in 2015 and in a further program of 60 minutes we do a follow-up where the participants can summarize for us what had happened and what happens next in their lives. We will for instance follow the national team coach Rikard Grip athletes Charlotte Kall Emil Jönsson Anna Haag Emma Wikén Stina Nilsson and Calle Halfvarsson and many others.
