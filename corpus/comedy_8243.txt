Georgette live in Paris with her rather unexciting and effeminate husband an actor and interpretive dancer. Meanwhile Suzanne lives across the street and reads romance novels while dreaming of someone more exciting than her own lackluster spouse. Each woman happens across the other's husband and begins her dream affair. Four people: each cheating on their spouse and none of them aware that their own spouse is cheating. Who will find out first and how?
