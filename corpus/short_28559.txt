Memory is not a thing. It has no mass and occupies no space. But if the average human memory accumulated through one lifetime is made up of 280 quintillion bits of information then there must be some mode of organization some unit of storage something that allows us to maintain it to carry it treasure it horde it. Using 8mm footage shot of one family during the 40s and 50s this short film is a poetic meditation on not only the science behind the mechanisms of memory but the implications of such on an individual's identity. Using physics as a philosophy this film addresses questions of the self through the effects of time and space. "An Anatomy of Memory" challenges our ideas of evolution and humanity - and does not bother to disguise the vastness of death.
