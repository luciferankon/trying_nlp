Oleg Yefremov was one of the most beloved actors and directors in Russia. He was the founder of the Sovremennik (Contemporary) Theatre and later became the artistic director of the Moscow Art Theatre. The film shows him in a moment of extreme dramatic tension: Yefremov has decided to split the repertory company into two. His aim is to re energize a stagnant group of actors and move them away from an artistic "dead end". The company split into supporters and detractors discusses the situation on very heated terms. The situation mirrors the overall climate of a country and a society shaken by the changes brought about by perestroika. The film offers rare glimpses of the past - the creation of the "Sovremennik" Theater Yefremov's working at the Moscow Art Theatre clips of his films - all adding a note of ironic nostalgia to the dramatic events of the present. Russian. 87 minutes 1987
