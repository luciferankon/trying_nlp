A carefully selected human "herd" is dropped off in the Serengheti desert with the mission to track the greatest migration on the planet- the wildebeests! With no weapons & limited supplies they must face big cat country & many other predators while trying to survive together in the extreme temperatures & keep up with the wildebeest. Who will make it to the extraction point? A group of humans join the largest mammal herd migration and valiantly attempt to cross the Serengeti. As the group travels through dangerous open plains they must face not only savage conditions but also thirst deadly predators and each other. Hunger lion encounters and a crocodile-filled river are only a few of the obstacles the group will face.
