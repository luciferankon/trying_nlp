The second adaptation of the adventures of supersleuth Ellery Queen this time videotaped in New York. Queen was a mystery writer who assisted his father a detective with the New York Police Department in solving murders. Queen's methods were arcane and intellectual rather than action oriented and he always astounded his father by arriving at a correction solution by purely deductive reasoning.
