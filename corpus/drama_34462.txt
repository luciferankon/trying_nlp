The 10th a drama series (conceived from W E. B. Dubois's 20th century work The Talented Tenth) is a Detroit based dramatic series about five exceptional African American families and their struggle to live out the American dream in Birmingham MI. Often African American culture is defined in homogeneous terms thereby losing the complexities that cut across class gender and sexual orientation lines. This walk into the fictional worlds of the Ellis Cash Landon Hayes and Cardeli families is intended to reflect that heterogeneous dynamic that makes up the contemporary African American cultural experience. The show deals in an entertaining fashion with issues of class gender and identity formation in the African-American community while exploring political issues related to metro Detroit's unique socio-economic climate. The target audience spans a huge demographic range and targets audiences 18 -55.
