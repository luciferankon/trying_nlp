A group of disconnected people are all being brought together by a string of awkward events in post-tragedy 9/11 Manhattan... A body-snatcher (Mia Tyler) is snatching up dead bodies off the streets of the city and no one seems to know exactly what she is doing with them especially the two cops (Peter McNolte and Eddie Steeples) who are assigned to find her. Across town Angela (Angela Bettis) is a depressed Broadway actress who has a reunion with her old friend (Tasha Guvara) and there is some awkward tension about the distance that is now between them. Angela's boyfriend Kevin (Kevin Ford) a neurotic self-proclaimed 'suicidal' filmmaker captures the women's reunion for his 'new movie.' In order to lift up his own spirits Kevin seeks out the counsel of his paranoid best friend (Cinque Lee) to try to find advice about life... Soundtracked by a medley of music from the band Sonic Youth PEOPLE ARE DEAD is a slice out of contemporary New York life. But not the high-brow kind that is seen so often... this is about the people in the background the alleys and the subways who just feel stuck.
