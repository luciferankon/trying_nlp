16-year-old Georgia is embarking on the most life-changing months of her life in this surprisingly moving coming-of-age film. Georgia's mum is topless model and plastic surgery addict Alicia Douvall. The film follows their tempestuous yet endearing relationship as they encounter their biggest challenge yet - single mum Alicia is having a baby and throwing both their lives upside down. Georgia is reluctantly taken to America in the middle of her mock exams so that she can care for her new baby sister while her mother undergoes further cosmetic surgery. Will Georgia continue to support her mum's decisions or has she gone too far and driven a wedge between them?
