Dittsche is a German unemployed who comes to a takeaway from time to time to buy some new bottles of beer. In a real Big-Lebowski-outfit he drinks his first bottle of beer always in the takeaway. At the same time he starts talking to Ingo the publican. Dittsche explains the world from his point of view. Everything he knows seem to be out of yellow press. So he developes the weirdest theories about the world sports and celebreties. The whole thing is an ad-lib live show.
