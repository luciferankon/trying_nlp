It was somewhere there on the banks of the Ethiopian River Omo far from the civilized world that the oldest bones of primaeval man were found. For millions of years however the history of human civilization avoided this territory. Thanks to that tribes have survived which can take us back into the past so that we can better understand where we have come from and maybe also where we are going. Six daring people set out for the unknown on a raft through the dangerous canyon of the River Omo. They fought their way through wild rapids on this river flowing through no man's land encountering large numbers of hippopotami and crocodiles to discover not only people living naturally along the lower reaches of the River Omo but themselves as well.
