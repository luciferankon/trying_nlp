This is a comedic 70s attempt to warn people that STDs are easily spread and as easily prevented. The movie begins with a woman of questionable character and proceeds through the entire community as scene after scene depicts the spread of an STD from partner to partner until we arrive in a Doctor's office at the end being treated for an STD. Some of the scenes are very funny some a bit odd and a couple might make you thoughtful. The acting is good scenes pretty well done. Not a bad effort for the time.
