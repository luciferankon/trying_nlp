The final seven head to the studio to receive their next challenge. For the first time the contestants will all work together. Their challenge is to produce two segments for a new children's show. One of the two segments must be a musical. The contestants have to pick a team leader. They all decided that Daniel will be their leader so he divides the team in half. Zo Schliz and Gwen will work on the musical segment. Jessica Evie and Adam will work on the scripted segment. The next day the remaining seven headed off to elimination. The musical segment was about making friends. The judges thought that they executed it. They liked the scene and how it led up to the song. They also liked the turtle's name Shellby and the lyrics to the song. The other segment was about protecting the environment and recycling. Daniel was asked if he got hired and had a budget to take six people but who would he not take. Daniel picked Gwen since she did not help him on the pitch. Schliz was asked the same question and he picked Gwen as well. Gwen had to pick a person as well and she chose Daniel. Zo picked Evie since he has had problems with her. Jessica picked Daniel. Unexpectedly Evie picked Zo to go home. Adam refused to answer the question but when he was forced to pick someone he chose everyone to go instead of him to go home (that was his way to avoid the question). The contestants were then excused from the room while the judges picked which one should go home. The seven remaining contestants were brought back into the room. Jessica was the winner since it was her idea for the scripted segment and for the name she gave the turtle. Zo was saved for writing the song. Evie and Schliz were also saved. Daniel was saved which left Gwen or Adam to be eliminated. Adam was eliminate since he could not deliver a answer right away. And because the judges could only see him as a writer and not a producer.
