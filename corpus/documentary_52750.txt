Journey to the last great wilderness of North America where polar bears roam and caribou herds congregate by the thousands. Here is where belugas walruses and bowhead whales migrate through the ice laden arctic seas during summer. See hundres of species of birds arrive to breed on the tundra and witness how the mighty muskox clash for breeding rights. Marvel at the beauty of the Arctic and the magic of the Northern Lights.
