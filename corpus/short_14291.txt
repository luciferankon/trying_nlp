Four people talk about aspects of their work. A flight attendant on a 747 shows us some of what's involved in getting the cabin ready for the next flight. A man in a hardhat discusses the capacity of a huge steam shovel shaped like a wheel as it turns and moves earth in the background. A man who sells room furnishings talks about trying to make advertising fliers. A cemetery manager describes burial options. All are cheerful.
