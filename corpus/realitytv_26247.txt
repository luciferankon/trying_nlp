High Noon Entertainment hosts visit the Asian style home of Ramblin' "Doc" Tommy Scott in the North Georgia mountains. The home is the base camp for Scott's Last Real Old Time Medicine Show. Two segments were included per episode. You will find info about this episode at http://www.georgia.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/Industries/Entertainment/1106FallNewsletter.pdf on page 5.... Unfortunately I do not know the correct name of the episode and the exact air date although it aired several times after June of that year.
