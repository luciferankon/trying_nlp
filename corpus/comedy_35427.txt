A Mockumentary that follows a recent film school graduate (Gregory Rocco) who sets out to make his first legitimate short film. Deciding to pay standard union rates for the production leaves him only enough money to bring on an agitated Director of Photography (Michael Mastroserio) and an emotionally unstable sound guy (John Larkin). On top of all of this Gregory must deal with the leading male actor the egotistical and insecure (Kevin Michael Murphy.)
