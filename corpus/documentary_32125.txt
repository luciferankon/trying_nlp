In Petrila a coal mining town in Transylvania (Romania) an ex-miner turned artist and activist uses art and absurdism to stop local authorities from demolishing the historic buildings of the oldest coal mine in the country after its' closure in 2015 at EU's recommendation. His quest is not only to preserve the history and the identity of his hometown but also to find new ways of keeping the community from irreversibly falling apart.
