To compliment a new series on England this one-off special follows poet Benjamin Zephaniah as he tours Birmingham recalling the influence the city had on him as he grew up there and its continued influence on his work and life today. Charged with composing a poem about the city he revisits the areas of his youth from Soho Road in Handsworth to Villa Park in Witton - home of Aston Villa football club. As his personal journey continues he visits his old schools and stomping grounds looking for inspiration.
