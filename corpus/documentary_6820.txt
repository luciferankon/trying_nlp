Half A Citizen a documentary film produced by American Films is about the lives of former felons in Florida who have been stripped of their right to vote. Governor Rick Scott has passed harsh restrictions that force these people to undergo a lengthy and complicated application process to regain their voting rights. It's a process that can take years and often gets denied. As a result 10% of Florida's adult population is currently ineligible to vote. This 10% is disproportionately made up of minorities and the underprivileged. "Half A Citizen" explores how this culture of disenfranchisement came to be and what implications it has for all Americans.
