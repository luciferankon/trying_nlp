TMWQ (2013) is a contemporary take on Robert Musil's novel "The Man Without Qualities" pairing selected quotes from the novel with Instagram photos from random users. Ulrich in the novel is preoccupied with the experience of reality in his time (the 1930's) and my video captures its added relevance when read today as people read less and consume images rather than experiences. Instagram culture is its perfect manifestation. "A world of qualities without a man has arisen of experiences without the person who experiences them... private experience is a thing of the past dissolved into a system of formulas of possible meanings." The Man Without Qualities Robert Musil 1930-1941.
