Free-diver Goran Colak has dedicated his life to surviving devoid of oxygen. Driven by a desire to be the best in the world Goran has achieved every feat possible in the sport of free-diving. In doing so he has expanded our understanding of human capability floating in an arrested state somewhere between life and death. Beautifully lyrical My Life Without Air demonstrates the power of will to transcend its body's earthly limitations. My Life without Air is a thrilling view of the wondrous world of a man whose most important moments in life take place underwater during one highly controlled breath. Unrelentingly shifting the boundaries of physicality he persists beyond the possible believing that upon return to the surface he will once again be the best.
