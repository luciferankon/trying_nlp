Documentary film about the historic porn cinema of Ferrara housed in a deconsecrated church dating from the 10th century. The church was deconsecrated during the Napoleonic invasion and was turned into a cinema in 1940 but before it was a dance school a warehouse and slaughterhouse. After the advent of porn cinema houses in Italy it turned into a red light cinema also to face several economic problems. The documentary focuses on the people who works (or worked) there and spectators who go there everyday. In the Mignon is possible to watch a wide selection of porn classics and rarities even the famous Deep Throath but also erotic art films like Borowczyk's The Beast and Zulawski's Possession. The story also gives the occasion for a reflection about moral prejudices bigotry and the old idea of small cinema an idea soon destined to disappearance.
