Sa was sent to Bangkok from her village when she was just 15. After three years of working in a factory for 3 dollars a day she decided to become an escort girl in order to support her family. Four years later in small lobby of a dark hotel she met me and I invited her to be the subject of this film. Weaving between documentary and fiction my vision is to create a personal landscape of Sa whose ambitions experience and optimism is shared by many impoverished young women who are faced with the same hard choice. This film is not a sob story about her life. It is her anthem- her way of sharing with me her hopes dreams and fears.
