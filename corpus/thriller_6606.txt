Freely inspired from a historical event. In December 1981 American officer James Lee Dozier is kidnapped in Verona by a "Brigate Rosse" commando. The huge intelligence effort that followed the fact ends after 40 days in Padova with an action by Nocs (Italian special operation police) releasing the kidnapped. The political consequence of the fact was the major crisis of the military and logistic organization of "Brigate Rosse". In the fictional reconstruction there are some changes among which the introduction of the commissioner Vincenzo Masci actually never existed.
