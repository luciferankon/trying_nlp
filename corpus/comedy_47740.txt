Christian is a dreamer who cannot find his place in this world; for the past 10 years he's been living in London a city of a million opportunities and training to become a professional in martial arts. At 35 years old nothing he aspired to has become a reality. When he finds himself unemployed his girlfriend (tired of his endless excuses) kicks him to the curb. Now he will be forced back to his birthplace Genoa where he will have to rediscover himself reinvent himself and above all else adapt himself to a new reality of friends and family a reality far different from that which he imagined.
