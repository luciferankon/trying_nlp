A supermarket manageress from Ahlbeck on the island of Usedom is found dead in the neighboring Polish resort of Swinem√ºnde. Inspector Julia Thiel and her Polish colleague Marek investigate. The dead woman was planning to meet one of her employees to discuss a mysterious property swap. The case is a challenge for Julia Thiel because her mother of all people is a "legal adviser" to the main suspect. To cap it all her adolescent daughter is proving difficult having found out she's having an affair with her Polish colleague.
