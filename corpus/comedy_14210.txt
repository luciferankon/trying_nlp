Harry lives in a retirement home with a bunch of 'Off the wall' residents and staff. He has lived in Dorset all his life and jumps at any chance to regale visitors with stories of his early years and life in rural Dorset between the wars. But what is fact and what is fantasy or is it just Harry being mischievous with his 'tongue in cheek' tales of a village peopled by eccentrics and really strange folk? So when a writer looking for a home for his father tells Harry he'd like to write a book about him the 'floodgates' open.
