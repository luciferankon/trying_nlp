A young woman and her friends returning from helping with hurricane relief efforts in Florida stop in the town of Amityville to check in on her sickly grandmother. There they find all is not well as an ancient witch's spirit permeates the whole place. This evil curse threatens to destroy the descendants of the townsfolk who condemned the witch to death over 300 years ago.
