From within the woods a blood splattered young man named John Prescott (Chris Moore) is found on the side of the road... terrified and muttering gibberish. Enter Dr. Pamela Alley (Becca McIntyre) an esteemed psychologist and Morris West (J.K. Michaels) a detective from the local police force who have just been assigned the boy's case. As the teen begins telling his diabolical tale of a local weekend vacation gone horribly wrong it becomes clear that nothing is ever what it seems when a very troubled substitute teacher (Lynn Lowry) with a webbed past of nightmares emerges as the center of the proceedings. What keys does she hold to the nearly phantasmic events surrounding the area for the last several years? The more they attempt to uncover the truth the more they put themselves into grave danger. Perhaps some secrets are better left in...the House of Covered Mirrors. Featuring legendary indie scream queens Lynn Lowry and Debbie Rochon The House of Covered Mirrors guarantees you an authentic visceral yet surreal experience straight from the era where grindhouse slashers & Drive-in Horror relentlessly ruled the cinemas!
