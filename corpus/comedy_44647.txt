The classic tale of lust jealousy and vengeance takes on a lighter mischievously comic tone as two subsidiary female characters (the moralistic house concierge and a worldly-wise "actress") candidly discuss the melodramatic goings-on around them. The story - in which Tosca must save her unfaithful lover from execution by giving herself to the brutal chief of police - is told through an actual performance of Puccini's grand opera and takes on a contemporary ironically comic tone in the earthy gossiping conversations between the two eavesdropping women.
