Taking sauna is the Finnish people's national obsession so there are two of the per five Fins and they build theme everywhere even on military operations and aboard vessels but preferably near a lake to dive in even on ice days with trees to cut whisking birches from. Weekly usually on Saturday is considered a hygienic minimum daily the good life especially in summer and holidays. It's a family and/or social activity relaxing and removing social barriers but also linked to sports and all kinds of bonding.
