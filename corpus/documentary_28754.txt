Roger Buffham - formerly Head of Security at The Jockey Club - reveals serious race fixing and drug dealing in many of the UK's race meetings. Despite his submissions of evidence to the Jockey Club they chose to ignore his warnings - eventually sacking him. Buffham then brought his evidence to the BBC Panorama programme. The investigation took over a year and the final film received front page coverage in the British press and on the BBC news.
