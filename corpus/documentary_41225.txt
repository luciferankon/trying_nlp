2007 was the year Death by Audio transformed from a musician-run DIY loft into an underground music venue. John and Takako Tymkiw longtime friends of DBA recognized this pivotal moment and filmed it. The result You Were Here is a fly-on-the-wall portrait of one year at this beloved Brooklyn venue. Although it's less polished than _Goodnight Brooklyn - The Story of Death by Audio (2016)_ (qv) it's a more intimate perspective with plenty of candid footage interviews rehearsals and performances by musicians who lived there.
