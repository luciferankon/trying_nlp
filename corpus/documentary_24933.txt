A Lovely Day documents nine youths from Oakland California immersed in a six month Hip Hop music therapy workshop. The film chronicles the youth as they set out to make music that not only expresses their thoughts but also builds a stronger community through widespread change and hope. The resiliency upheld by these teens' voices shows that they cannot be dismissed that they are in fact some of our most important educators in a critical time of change.
