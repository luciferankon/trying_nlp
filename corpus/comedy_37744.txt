Baker Jan Racek ('Vladimír Repa' (qv)) is a very hard-working and sensible man. His great passion is pigeon-keeping and also for many years Ruzenka ('Ludmila Vostrcilová' (qv)). They are going to get married but Racek is busy waiting for the pigeons' return and misses the wedding. The engaged couple is already getting a little older so the otherwise kind Ruzenka gets very angry at this and gives Racek an ultimatum - it's going to be her or the pigeons.
