As part of British Film Year Thames Television asked three British film directors (Lindsay Anderson Alan Parker and Richard Attenborough) to each make a documentary on British Cinema. Lindsay Anderson's programme looked at the history of 'Free Cinema' which he argued started with the work of Humphrey Jennings and ended with Britannia Hospital . Anderson used the programme as an opportunity to criticise British Film Year (which he disagreed with) but the documentary is also a passionate retrospective of the films of Anderson and his 'Free Cinema' colleagues.
