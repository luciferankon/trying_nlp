Parfenov's documentary shot for Alexander Pushkin's 200th anniversary shows a full-scale picture of the places related to the poet's life historical materials and excerpts from other films. Some of the material looks like a silent feature film. Parfenov presents the poet's biography as a contemporary chronicler.
