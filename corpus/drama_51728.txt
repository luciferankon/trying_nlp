A series about a German public youth centre called "fabrixx" (for it is located in an old fabric) in Stuttgart Germany. The young people face the usual problems of getting older falling in love and other personal stuff but also German society's problems (racism nationalism ...) are reflected. We see the 10-16 year old people having fun solving problems and helping others.
