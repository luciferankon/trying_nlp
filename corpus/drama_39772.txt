In 1983 Oliver Nicholas at thirteen is well-poised to enter the precocious teenage world of first-sex vodka and possible-love in New York City when he is traumatized by the stroke of his housekeeper (and only true maternal figure) a sixty-five-year-old Chilean woman named Aida. What was supposed to be an exhilarating and somewhat fearful rite of passage - diving into the exciting fast-paced world of first experiences - quickly becomes skewed by an incomprehensible depression and a house of interior horrors. Surrounded by women - his untraditional Spanish photographer mother (more interested in the role of confidante than mother) his sister a comedic door-slamming tormentor marked by her parent's divorce; and Aida his silver-haired emotional focal point on the verge of death in Lenox Hill Hospital - Oliver struggles to maintain his role as "man of the house" and his sanity. With his best friends Valerio a chain-smoking nunchucking grandiose artist; and Nick a cynical foul-mouthed jokester Oliver struggles through attacks of mania drunkenness first love betrayal migraine-inducing masturbation virginity and the loss of an imaginary friend . . . hoping to survive this uniquely-New-York baptism by fire.
