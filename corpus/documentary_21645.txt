In 1976 British Rail introduced an iconic new train the HST (High Speed Train) 125 which was capable of travelling at up to 125 mph. A marketing campaign fronted by 'Jimmy Savile' (qv) using the slogan "This is the age of the train" helped revive the poor image and looming financial crisis of British Rail.
