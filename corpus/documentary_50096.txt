Born in former West Germany German Cash is our documentary's protagonist. inspired to help raise the quality of life for ill children he leans on the artistic and humanistic legacy of Johnny Cash. German Cash picks up his perfectly imperfect role model's mic--and to a remarkable degree of authenticity he makes his own the distinct sound of the late Man in Black. But German Cash not only reverberates the voice of a legend on behalf of the cause that chose him. He simultaneously sings to the one voice as shared by all who help(ed) ease the human journey through the ages.
