One February day in 2007 a man from the Department of Homeland Security arrived at Gloria Garza's house in South Texas. He asked her to sign a letter granting permission to build a 25 foot Wall on her property. She thought it was joke. A small town a border sheriff and two illegal immigrants all become intertwined by one 25-foot Wall. Filmed over two years along the Southwest The Wall is a documentary about the construction of a fence along the Mexican border. Congress had the blueprints but they never planned for human nature.
