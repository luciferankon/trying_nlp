In 1945 about 3 000 German soldiers and a 167 Baltic legionaries came as refugees to Sweden. Those who came via the island Gotland were first detained there in a camp next to Havdhem but later collaborated with those who came via Ystad to a camp in Ränneslätt outside Eksjö. In November the government announced that the Balts would be handed out causing a hunger strike and a number of suicides. The film has a lot of documentary features in the form of authentic movie clips and photos.
