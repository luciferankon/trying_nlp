Jane Young is summoned to the local police station to give her statement regarding an active homicide investigation. Although she is not deemed a person of interest detective Mike Morgans instincts compel him to dig deeper into the mind of a religious zealot. The course of the interview and ultimately the investigation of the truth leads them on a collision course where the laws of man and the laws of God will collide. My Experience is a taut highly intellectual character study in the mold of classic film noir and is punctuated by an unimaginable surprise ending that will leave you speechless.
