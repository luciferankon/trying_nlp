Saboot is a detective series with Anita Kanwar playing Inspector KC who is not your run of the mill detective. She appears confused and anxious but behind all this she is a very observant and intelligent person. This series redefined the detective genre in Indian television not just with the first female protagonist in any such series but also with a significant change in the format where the perpetrator is revealed in the beginning and the show is not about who did it but about how inspector KC will reach the culprit.
