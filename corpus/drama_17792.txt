Hirata and Kageyama are old friends from childhood. Now in their old age they have retired from the job and they made their mind up to hit the road for a change leaving all cares behind. On the road they're taking their time to relax. They're talking about old days just joking around or laughing. However there is one big problem: the food is poor for they're camping out along the way. Things seemed to get better dramatically when they happened to find Soba restaurant in some remote place. Of course they didn't know at the time that it's just the beginning of their strange dream-like experience that would follow.
