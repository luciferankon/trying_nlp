A journey into the world of up-cycling following two young art curators travelling on a vintage van and hitting the road from South to North of Italy. Their aim is to meet different artists and designers that put at the center of their creative process the ethical imperative of reusing wasted materials and discarded objects in order to give them a new life and a new function. The artists featured in the film belong to a world generation of creative practitioners that embraces the new consuming philosophy of reusing remixing and re-imagining our life against the proliferation and unsustainable logic of consumer society.
