La polvere di Morandi ("Giorgio Morandi's Dust") is an art-bio doc film about worldwide renowned Italian artist Giorgio Morandi (Bologna Italy 1890-1964). This is the very first biopic of this kind about him made with the patronage of Museo Morandi & Museum of Modern Art Bologna (MamBO). The film focuses on the three most crucial locations of his art to show us the secret places of his secluded life: his home-studio in via Fondazza (Bologna) recently restored and brought back to its original essence and finally open to the public; his monastic summer retreat on the hills of Grizzana (near Bologna) and 'Museum' as an abstract space where his life becomes art. His peculiar personality is shown in unprecedented ways thanks to memories anecdotes and emotions of friends and art-critics chosen among his few intimates. His sensibility as a painter and engraver is explored by the author through a poetic visual reinterpretation of his artwork.
