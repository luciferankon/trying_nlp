A loose Flemish TV comedy format in which Gaston Berghmans the surviving member of the popular Antwerp (dialect!) stand-up comedians duo with Leo Martin (which toured the theaters of Flanders as well as making occasional TV programs and even a few movies) presented and starred in most of the short widely varied comical sketches without much further structure rather just consecutive jokes.
