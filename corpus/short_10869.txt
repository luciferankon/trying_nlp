Meet Ken Depena the 80 year old volunteer with bite! Piously devoted to The Salvation Army since 1949 Ken currently serves as the receptionist at Salvo youth refuge Oasis where his old world philosophy of hard labour and abstinence clashes dramatically with the daily reality of the centre's wayward teens. At night Ken can be found in uniform and hat with his little wooden collection box trawling the establishments of the inner city raising money for the Army's good work. Transferred from suburbia to the Kings Cross corps as a chaste young man he has circulated in Sydney's wildest area for most of his adult life brushing uniformed shoulders with the drug addicts prostitutes and transvestites that make the area notorious. It was all in God's plan for him. These days Ken's march is more of a shuffle but his dedication to the cause is as fiery as ever.
