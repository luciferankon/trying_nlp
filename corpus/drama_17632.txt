College sophomore Riley Adams dreams of being a world class elite dancer believing her success can be a platform to share her Christian faith. Being raised in a single parent home she's replaced the absence of her mother with the illusion of control by learning to drive toward success by giving 150% all the time.. Victory in regional competition has gained her a coveted shot at the nationals but a horrific accident brings her dreams to a halt and her illusion of control to a standstill. For the first time in her life no amount of effort can affect change - at least not fast enough for Riley who still believes she can recover in time for nationals. Equine therapy may help Riley gain full mobility and true to character Riley throws herself headlong into the process (spurred along a bit by an attractive and charming therapist). Through the process Riley develops a bond with a beautiful horse named Grace and rediscovers her drive to succeed. Just when it seems the old Riley is back and her confidence in her own effort is returning disaster strikes and it seems everything Riley is working for is will come to naught. Through a moving spiritual odyssey Riley finally comes to understand that it's not about effort and control but surrender and sees that her real purpose in life will be discovered by seeing circumstances through His eyes. The point is driven home when a completely unexpected act of kindness comes from a most unexpected place. Healed By Grace is a charming and heart wrenching journey of faith that explores the place of surrender that clears the veil and allows Riley to see through God's eyes and discover His purpose for her life.
