This mockumentary shows us what would have happened if man wouldn't have reached the Moon. Everything takes place in Shepperton Studios (London); several days before Saturn V rocket launch from Kennedy Space Center Florida (USA). Recorded in making of style and mixed with the thoughts of professional technicians of "Agrupació Astronňmica de Sabadell".
