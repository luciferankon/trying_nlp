Beautiful socialite Madeline White travels to the Old World to be reunited with her fianc√©e Neil Bellamy with plans to marry. However on her voyage to the island she meets wealthy plantation owner Gilles Beaumonde who secretly falls in love with her. Upon her arrival Neil and Madeline seal their plans to marry unaware that Beaumonde already has his own intentions for Madeline. Beaumonde enlists the help of evil voodoo master Severin Devereaux who commands a crew of zombies with nefarious plans of his own. Although this remake adheres to many elements of the 1932 classic it also differs greatly in its fantasy steam punk approach. This "White Zombie" includes new characters that flesh out the idea of voodoo as a key element of zombie-lore. In addition to characters carried over from the original are Baron Samedi (the "loa" or guardian of cemeteries) guede (death spirits) voodoo witches (reminiscent of those in Shakespeare's "Macbeth") and powerful voodoo priestess Mambo Brigitte who fights to uncross the zombie curse.
