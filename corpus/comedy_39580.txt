In a sanitarium for injures of war some ghosts are waiting and wandering about but for different reasons. One of them is a well-looking ancient ghost who is appearing in the last moments of life. His apprentice is a ghost of a young soldier whose body was never found. He should accompany the recently passed away souls and deliver them to the gates of hell. It is a surreal story involving ghosts.
