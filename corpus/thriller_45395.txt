In this American-Italian co-production Carter an art conservator travels to the mountainous Abruzzo region of Italy. He has been commissioned to restore a fresco in a church in the small town of Secinaro on the slopes of Mount Sirente. When he arrives in the remote town Carter finds the local people strange and they seem to be hiding something from him. As his work progresses he begins to uncover a mystery - possibly related to the nearby lake. Legend has it that the lake was created by a meteorite and that the impact that created the lake could be related to the religious vision seen by the Roman Emperor Constantine I - that persuaded him to convert to Christianity on the eve of the historic Battle of the Milvian Bridge. Will Carter uncover the secrets that surround the ancient Mount Sirente?
