40 years of a cultural venue in the little village Lutterbek ( Schleswig-Holstein Germany ). A special place with a history - big art being performed on a small stage. The magic of the village pub the people in the house and around is being put together as a mosaic of film photography and music from 1975 to the present. Old sound and video recordings of events (that were made in-house) from the archive of Wolfgang Marx are being combined with interviews documenting exciting views from various perspectives on a place where art is pulling the strings.
