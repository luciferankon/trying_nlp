Confluence is an adventure water documentary that incorporates a 2014 science expedition and broader water issues presented as the miles flow downstream. The MRRE team canoed 2400 miles to collect water quality data along the Missouri River. Confluence will use the science survey of the Missouri River as a metaphor to further survey the universal water issues we face. From water pollution to fracking to GMO's to misguided politics to environmental degradation to profiteering companies to personal lifestyle choices no one is spared from the Confluence of participation in life and accountability in actions.
