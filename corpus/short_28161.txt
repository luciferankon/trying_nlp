'wired' is an investigation about the power of collective denial in one of the most overpopulated cities in Lebanon and the Middle-East. It questions the domination of denial in regards to the aesthetics of life and the connotation of living in a specific society. The idea of looking up into the wires connected to buildings on both sides and striping the open space brings out the history of the society woes and illustrate the background of people living in this particular space. Whether the cables are for Internet electricity power or satellite the question remains: are we connected or just wired?
