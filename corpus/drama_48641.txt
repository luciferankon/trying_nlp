Ramallah this decade. A free spirited woman dancer Kamar finds herself the wife of a prisoner Zaid and away from everything she loves until she returns to the dance defying society's taboos. At the dance Kamar is confronted with Kais a Palestinian returnee who has taken Kamar's role as the head choreographer. Sparks fly between Kamar and Kais creating more than a passionate emotional dance for the both of them. Matters become even more complicated when Zaid's sentence is extended. At the same time the family's legal case against the land confiscation faces one obstacle after another and the villagers from the nearby villages are unable to reach the family's olive groves placing the annual harvest and consequently the family's livelihood in danger. And Kamar's life is thrown into turmoil as she becomes increasingly attached to Kais and caught in the midst of her desire to dance and breaking the family and society taboos of the prisoner's wife's role while life under occupation rages on.
