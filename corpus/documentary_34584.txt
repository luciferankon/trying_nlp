A documentary that takes the viewer into the Patrick O'Hearn School in Dorchester Massachusetts a tough neighborhood of Boston - an inclusive school where one third of the students have disabilities of some kind. It is shot in the 'Direct Cinema' style with no narration or interviews and reveals that Inclusion as a choice in an urban school system can be successful for both the disabled children and everyone else. The surprise is that there is a waiting list to get in from both communities.
