An elderly man lives alone in a flat doing crossword puzzles. He has his radio on for the fishermen's report the weather and an exercise program but he always turns off the news. His breakfast is a cup of coffee his lunch a can of soup heated directly on the stove. At 9 a.m. at 2 p.m. and sometimes in the evening his doorbell rings: it's his neighbor asking for help with a word in her crossword puzzle. Her missing words seem to be clues to a relationship and one day when the doorbell doesn't ring he must decide if he wants to fill in the blanks in his life.
