A down on his luck wannabe journalist lands a sweet part time gig as a hotel security nightwatchman. There he discovers an onslaught of bizarre characters including his 'Die Hard' obsessed boss beautiful and damaged Adeline and a host of guests just as news breaks that someone has been killing hotel security guards in the area. Oh yeah and he also might have testicular cancer.
