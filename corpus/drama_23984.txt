Conflicted military wife Katie Donahue (Tina Schlapprizzi) fame-seeking sorority girl Hailey Kirsch (Lyndsey Doolen) and free-spirited mother of two Denise Jensen (Isabelle Giroux) have just one thing in common.

Each woman has her own reasons for accepting a reality show producer's invitation to chronicle the very personal journey toward a decision about her pregnancy; but no one including their physician Dr. Patterson (Andray Johnson) is prepared for what happens when the cameras start rolling.
