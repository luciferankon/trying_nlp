In this historical documentary series archaeologists Alex Langlands and Peter Ginn and domestic historian Ruth Goodman team up to re-create a working Edwardian farm. The farm located at Morwellham Quay in Devon becomes home for the trio for a full calendar year as they learn to live a simpler but harder life during the turn of the 20th century. They have access only to tools and materials that would have been available at the time and take up the crafts and responsibilities of the average Edwardian farmer from harvesting crops and raising livestock to mining and fishing.
