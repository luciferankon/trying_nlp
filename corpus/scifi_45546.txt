Fade up in a dark airplane hanger. Several people are standing frozen and isolated. Suddenly they begin to breathe as if being resuscitated. We see people of various ages and states of being from someone in camping gear to college students holding books to an accountant with a pen still in his hand. The people are bewildered having no idea how or why they are here. Panic sets in as the characters try to explain their circumstances. After setting themselves free from the hanger they find themselves in a holocaust area. In the distance loom two large deserted military hangers as well as several desolate buildings. As they explore their surroundings we find they are not alone and several mysterious characters state they were also transported and add clues that begin to unlock clues to the mystery. The questions will be why were they brought there for what purpose and is there any means of escape back to their old lives. Speculations include aliens mass insanity or perhaps a limbo they were sent to because of wrongful indiscretions. The six part episodic drama will conclude with an ending no one ever expected.
