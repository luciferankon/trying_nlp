A man is in the middle of an identity crisis somewhere in time trying to figure out whether he is a 30-year-old young man arguing with his own future self at 70 over the consequences of his decision to kill a baby or whether he has already left that young age behind four decades ago and is now reflecting upon what he had already done at 30 during a dialogue with his young self over how he took away the life of an unborn child. The two only know that only one of them is real and the other is a delusion. A young desperate woman shows up and changes the equation.
