Hollywood via Highland is raw and powerful new experimental web series. It makes you wonder as you watch and meet new characters. The images flash across the screen and you put the puzzle pieces together as you go. Nothing is laid out directly or plainly because that would simply be too easy. The eloquence of the madness is what makes it so raw. You are given all the tools and it is then your turn to build the story and your reaction. It's eerie as you watch the scene unfold and fear the worst for the characters that you meet.
