A normal East-German family leads a normal life until the father and the elder son in a car knacker come across a luxury car. It is the kind of vehicle that only important people like ministers or high-up members of the Party use. It had been standing there since it had met with an accident neglected by everybody. Father and son love it at first glance. So they buy it for little money because nobody wants to attract attention that way and have the small damage repaired. The life of that common family changes ad a glance. When they go somewhere on that car they are exchanged for high-up people and they are treated with deference: police-men lead them out of traffic jams and pretend they did not see if they commit an offense; if they end up in a village the mayor and the local Party head invite them to lunch and show them the last achievement's of the local economy; if they go to the stadium the guards let them in while the gates are still closed and the mob is impatiently waiting outside; at the hotel there is always a room for them even if the former guest has first to be thrown out - They do not cheat people they do not take advantage of this situation but these things happen all the same. Nobody discovers that they are only common citizens because they do not ask: they are afraid to offend some personality of the Party. This unwanted game goes on until the car one day is stolen and the whole matter comes to the knowledge of the police who tries to get things straight in some way.
