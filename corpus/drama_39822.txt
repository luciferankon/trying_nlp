In the Depression Pete and Sidney are good kids working hard giving money to their parents and engaged for three years while they save to get married. Each has a selfish mother: Sydney's is cold Pete's is clingy. Sidney's mother is looking for her own happiness no matter how much that search harms her daughter and long-suffering husband; and the longer the engagement lingers the more pressure Pete's mom puts on Sidney to break it off and set her son free. "After Tomorrow" is Pete and Sidney's favorite song but with illness poverty and temptation: will that good day ever come?
