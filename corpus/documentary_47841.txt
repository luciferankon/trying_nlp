Oscar Ismael Poltronieri is an ordinary man. He cannot read or write. He has no money. He does not even have a house. Nevertheless he is a hero. During the war he was the most heroic soldier. He saved his mates' lives and fought alone against an entire British platoon. In his own country he did not receive the welcome he expected. Politicians as well as society turned their backs on him as they did with all the veterans. Now he is returning to the islands for the first time since the war. He needs to visit his fallen mates and close a circle in his life.
