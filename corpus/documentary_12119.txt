On the occasion of the Second Edition of The Biennial of Valencia "La ciudad Ideal" we make a trip inside the SOLARES (or on Optimism). Lóránd Hegyi the curator of the project is the guiding thread of the documentary based on the latest tendencies of world contemporary art and on the various interviews released by the artists of the "SOLARES" such as Dennis Oppenheim Richard Nonas Marina Abramovic Ilya Kabakov Gloria Friedmann Michelangelo Pistoletto who tell about their particularly vision of the world and their peculiar approach to the reality. The video shows the concept of "Ideal city" and "chaos" seen by each one of these great artists. Valencia is an artistic laboratory where the essence of the modern urbanism and the globalization elements emerge from forgotten and dismissed corners of the city: Solares. Thanks to Lorand Hegyi expertise audience has the chance to discover the creative profile of the town stressed by the artists words. The ancient streets of the city center are the ideal venues for the reflections of its inhabitants about the possibility to get closer to contemporary art to interact with its creators. The concept of chaos and the idea of familiarity create a particular stressful situation for the spectator who realises the necessity of a coexistence of both aspects in a complex social system often based on individualism. The SOLARES are empty and forgotten spaces which come back to life thanks to the art works with their colours. Art makes them become privileged spaces for imagination.
