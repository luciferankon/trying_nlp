Joe eviscerates a poorly conceived and badly produced biker game that may have literally come from Hell simply known as Ride to Hell: Retribution. It makes every mistake in the book in terms of poor programming sloppy game-play bad controls bad story and misogyny. In short he doesn't much care for the game.
