Who is MUKESH? An outsider. A bureaucrat. A physician. An unsung hero. A humanitarian. A rebel..... Dr. Mukesh Kapila is a UN career diplomat sent to negotiate a peace deal in Sudan after a 25-year civil war. Instead he learns that the first genocide of the 21st century is happening on his watch. Having to come to terms with his own sense of humanity amidst atrocity MUKESH is the story of a solitary man who attempts to overcome the extraordinary alone only to reconcile his own universal truth - that to save one life is to save the world entire.
