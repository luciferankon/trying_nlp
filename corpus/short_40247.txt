'Tatahi Muna' in Maori (language of native inhabitants of New Zealand) means 'Mystery Beach'. The project is a new and unique audiovisual fusion by film composer Jo Blankenburg. The love for New Zealand's unspoiled nature and the challenges of combining visuals and audio were Jo Blankenburg's primary inspiration for this project. The short film that is accompanied by a lush orchestral soundtrack featuring large orchestra and various celtic instruments was shot on stunning 'Te Henga' (Bethells Beach) on the North Island West of Auckland New Zealand. Jo Blankenburg's score captures the joyous and tender energy of the child actors and are his free expression of the innocent elation of the infantile. The film supports the Child Cancer Foundation New Zealand.
