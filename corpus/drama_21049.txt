The action took place in the Rhodope Mountains in the early 20th c. Two young people are in love with each other and want to marry. The girl's father however objects to their plans and makes every effort to separate the couple. Without any grounds he accuses the boy of committing a theft and the young man is forced to become a fugitive and hide in the mountains. The girl is waiting for her lover but to no avail. When coming back in two years the boy gets to know that she is dead. He treats the entire village in local pub and then gets back to the mountains - this time to commit suicide.
