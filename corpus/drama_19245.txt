Sex. Betrayal. Seduction. Manipulation. Addiction. Love. Hate. Vanity. Obsession. Words that brand each of the 8 characters of SHADE. Linda Ty Aurora Delilah Cassius D-Low Sega and John. Each a master at presenting carefully woven personas and each orchestrating solitary gambits of depravity. SHADE transcends convention decorum and time plunging the viewer down to the abyss in which we all reside but few embrace. Between the darkness and the light exists the shade. In that shade lives our characters.
