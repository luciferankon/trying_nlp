There once was a poor miller who had no children but three boys to work for him. The two older and larger ones were lazy mean and stupid. The youngest was hard-working friendly and cheerful. When the miller decides that he is too old to work anymore he tells each of the boys to go out into the world and find a beautiful horse. He who brings back the most beautiful horse will inherit the mill and must care for the miller in his old age. When the two older boys leave the youngest behind he meets a magic cat who says she will give him a beautiful horse as long as he can complete three tasks: first he has to chop wood with a silver axe; then he must cut down all the grass in the field by the end of the day; finally he must chop down trees and build the cat a home. He returns to the mill to wait for his reward and not only does Hans receive the horse but some even better surprises as well!
