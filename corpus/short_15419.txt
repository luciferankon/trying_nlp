Of the thousand and more men who left New York for the Cuban Campaign scarcely three hundred were able to shoulder their rifles to march before the Biograph camera at Camp Wikoff. The picture shows many of the companies reduced to seven or eight men and the whole regiment rank and file is in a sad condition. The picture is remarkably fine in every respect.
