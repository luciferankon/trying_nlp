The scene of the story is laid at San Diego in the grounds of the Panama Exposition and centers about a young girl whose mother near death has sent her with her little sister to look up her aunt. The aunt who with her unscrupulous husband runs a show at the exposition figures as the human butterfly. The girl is persecuted for her beauty by her uncle takes refuge with the Hawaiian players and finally is taken to a good home by a rich family from Honolulu. The production has not much merit as a drama but is interesting partly because of the exposition scenes which it presents.
