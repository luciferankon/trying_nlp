Amores Gatos is an experimental tragicomedy about a wannabe-poet jack-of-all-trades dilettante that earns his living as a cat-sitter in NYC. On a raucous night on the job he manages to lose the same cat three times only to realize when the owners unexpectedly return that their cat has been replaced by another.
