Who knows? Maybe one day your name - or that of someone you know - will stand among the greatest entrepreneurs of all time - Or maybe you'll simply find out the world has no need for an inside-the-egg-shell yolk scrambler. You know the one some poor guy spent $30000 and six years developing. There's only one way to find out - "Project Pitch It" the show where local entrepreneurs and their ideas are put to the ultimate test. Each week three aspiring - and often inspiring - local entrepreneurs get the chance to pitch their innovative new ideas to a panel of area business moguls. These successful self-made millionaires then pepper the entrepreneurs with questions assess the potential of each idea and finally present awards with a total value of nearly $30000 designed to help each entrepreneur move their business to the next step. The awards range from free tuition for mentoring and office space at Cardinal Stritch University a business dinner with the Brightstar Foundation or $10000 cash. Whatever the outcome it all adds up to one of the most exciting and entertaining local shows on TV. And who knows? We may even uncover or inspire the next great American success story.
