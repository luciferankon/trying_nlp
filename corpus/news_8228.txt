Under the aegis of VP/GM Joseph Stamler WABC-TV established its news department in October 1959 with its first regularly scheduled weekday newscast in the 11pm time slot. It's success prompted the station to expand weekdays at 6:15p following ABC's network news broadcast and on weekends with Saturday News Final and Sunday News Final.
