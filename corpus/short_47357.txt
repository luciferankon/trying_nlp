A sensational detective story founded on the romance of Leon Sazie. The noted criminal who terrorized all Europe is shown in these three Zigomar reels in a dramatic and intense struggle for supremacy with Paulin Broquet the celebrated detective who takes the two in the most varied and finest resorts. It is literally a chase through the entire continent with Broquet now having the upper hand and again Zigomar in its possession. Zigomar is the leader of a band of men who persist in plundering rich and poor. They know Broquet is on their trail and set a trap for him. However he escapes and in the melee which follows when he nearly captures Zigomar the latter also flees. A wonderful feature of this production is the "Will o' the Wisp" dance which the noted dancer Esmée performs at a ball in the Moulin Rouge in Paris. The festival begins by a magnificent procession in which the dancer is carried in a litter bedecked with jewels. In the succeeding darkness tiny flames light up and Esmée appears clad in white veils. She appears in the semi-darkness as a white apparition. Then the dance becomes gayer the dancer turns faster like a flower with changing colors and finally sinks exhausted to the floor. There are effects of colored light in this picture that never have been seen before. Immediately following there is a scene of great contrast when Zigomar sets fire to the place and the scene ends in wild disorder.
