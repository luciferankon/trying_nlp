In this episode Gordon joins Dorset police as they arrest motorists driving under the influence of cocaine. He witnesses National Crime Agency officers intercepting drug couriers laden with tens of thousands of pounds on their way to a major deal and handles 30 kilos of freshly confiscated cocaine as it arrives at a forensics laboratory for testing. Heading to the source Gordon treks deep into the jungle of Colombia - the world's biggest producer of cocaine - to meet a coca farmer who risks everything to produce the drug and witnesses the illegal cooking process by which the plant is transformed. After watching his brother fight addiction and one of his best chefs overdose off of cocaine in 2003 Gordon Ramsay wants to learn more about the drug. He finds out that customers and staff at his restaurant are using cocaine in the bathrooms and investigates the situation further to come to the conclusion that many more people than we think are on cocaine. He continues to meet up with "special" individuals to find out more information while also spreading awareness.
