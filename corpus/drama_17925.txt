This film was improvised in New York City and tells the story of Omar Dazy a French-Algerian livery driver. The action takes place during the 2010 World Cup in a world shaken by the recent financial collapse. While driving his cab Omar listens to the stories of people who have been touched by the absurdity of a system based on greed and self-interest. In the background of the city a constant stream of media bombards Omar with pundits and words like 'fraud' and 'criminal behavior'. Amidst all these voices Omar looks at this world and wonders what his answers are to the questions 'How did we get into this mess' and 'Who is responsible?'
