Chris a hardened auto-mechanic hopes to inspire a resurgence of white supremacist activity in Grant County Indiana. He avoids conflict with his girlfriend by wasting his weeknights at the local bar (in spite of his AA meetings) where Chuck plays the village sage. Chuck lives a prematurely retired life in a little room above a bar in Fairmount Indiana. Hospital bills loom as does his need to borrow money from his estranged daughter living in Indianapolis. Every night he walks downstairs to drink with oldies and newbies alike such as Alexa a Christian-college student coming to terms with her gay identity. Alexa and her two friends want to get their music noticed but struggle to find an audience for rap at their predominantly white Christian college. This cross-generational portrait of life in the cornfields examines family faith doubt health race and the pursuit of music backdropped by the crackling soil of early spring-time Indiana.
