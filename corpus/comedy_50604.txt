Visits by women are strictly prohibited in Ms Mossie's English pension for bachelors. Nevertheless some of the younger tenants cannot resist the temptation and sometimes try to sneak a young lady to their room. The landlady however stands guard all night in the lodge which becomes fatal to O'Brien - he is caught the lady thrown out and he himself receives immediate notice. Bernard Mulligan ('Josef Abrhám' (qv)) however is better off managing to get his Andela ('Iva Janzurová' (qv)) both to his room and to his bed. But morning is coming and Halibut ('Jirí Hrzán' (qv)) Mulligan's roommate is soon to return home from a ball. Mulligan does his best to wake the girl up and get her out. The sleepy Andela however instantly grasps that all her lover's tenderness is gone and begins to torture him maliciously.
