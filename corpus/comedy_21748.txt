Fire Captain Buddy Krebs' 16-year-old daughter Jennie Lee begins getting show-business offers because of her singing talents in the country/pop genre. This scares Buddy because he does not want his daughter to grow up too fast. Adding to his troubles are (1) his wife runs off with a bellhop (2) his 17-year-old son has muscle instead of brains in his head (3) his crew down at the firehouse are "strange": Feldmand tells his mother he is a doctor instead of a fireman Rosetti has only sex on the brain and Max a Hispanic speaks fractured English. Finally his daughter signs with a manager named Moose; the name fits the description of the woman.
