A Filipina teacher Zheny Dimaguiba came across a Chinese man Chen Sy. The two fell in love and married. As Zheny delivered her child it was announced that her baby was a girl. According to Chinese customs the male child is much more preferred and to China's one child policy a couple must not give birth to another child or put up the first child for adoption to give birth to another one. Zheny decided to protect her daughter Jade Dimaguiba by taking her back to the Phillipines. She also had a son Yuan Dimaguiba which passed away due to a miscarriage without the knowledge of Chen. Chen and Zheny divorced. Chen later married a woman named Jean Zheny's ex-best friend in the Phillipines and had a son Chen Sy II but also died. Chen also had a daugher Amethyst with Jean. The two establised Chen Jean Int'l a corporation specializing in hotels and restaurants. Jade grew up in Binondo the world's first and Phillipine's largest Chinatown. She had a childhood friend Onyx which is also her neighbor. But when Jade grows up she longs for the attention and affection from her father but every try she makes Chen still disregards her as his daughter. She then has to borrow her brother Yuan's identity to follow her dreams.
