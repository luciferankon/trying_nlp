In the magical territory of Nudonia (a land of many kingdoms) resides a small band of warriors called Doraleous and Associates who challenge the forces of evil. Outnumbered and out-weaponed the small group of heroes seek the legendary Zephyr blade (guarded by the Lady of the Lake) to face the immortal Titanus and the Nanadoo Army. Together Doraleous and his noble warriors Neebs Drak Mirdon Broof and Sir Walken take on the most dangerous feats and support those who cannot defeat dark forces on their own...for a small fee.
