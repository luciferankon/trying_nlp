In America colonias "the Spanish word for neighborhoods" has come to describe rows of "ruddy crudely constructed shacks that are little more than a patchwork of old boards and cardboard" according to one resident. These single or double room dwellings were placed on land that was never registered with any city or county. As a result these communities exist without fundamental services such as water and electricity.
