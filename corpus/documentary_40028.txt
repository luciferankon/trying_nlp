The Apple Pushers narrated by Edward Norton follows the inspiring stories of five immigrant pushcart vendors who are rolling fresh fruits and vegetables into New York City's food deserts - neighborhoods where finding a ripe red apple is a serious challenge and where obesity rates are skyrocketing. These micro-entrepreneurs who hail from Ecuador Russia Mexico and Bangladesh are at the heart of a unique urban strategy the Green Cart Initiative which seeks to increase the availability of fresh produce in under-served communities in an effort to combat the obesity epidemic found in so many of America's cities.
