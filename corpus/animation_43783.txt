A Griffin (a beast that is half eagle/half lion) comes to a town that has his likeness above the church door. Having never seen himself he becomes fascinated with the statue. His presence frightens the villagers and they ask their Minor Canon to get rid of him. The Griffin only eats twice a year and he only eats those he likes. And he grows to like the Minor Canon thus causing a moral dilemma.
