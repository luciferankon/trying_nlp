Dan Bell Will Krupinsky and Brian Sterowski visit an ornate religious school that dates back to the 19th century. This structure is grand both is size and d√©cor and has somehow managed to escape many of the ravages of time and somehow of graffiti and vandalism. Taking this film tour is like taking a trip back to another architectural time.
