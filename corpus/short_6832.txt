Christmas morning in the Hardy family's living room. Andy is the first one down the stairs; he finds a small enthusiastic dog waiting for him under the tree. The rest of the family follows: Emily and her husband the judge Aunt Milly and Andy's sister Marian. She finds a tennis racquet and thanks her mother. Judge Hardy sits in his easy chair to open a gift while Andy runs to bring in a fishing rod wrapped up for his dad. As everyone's gathered around the patriarch he looks toward the camera and wishes happy holidays to the audience - and thanks them for keeping the Hardys going. The rest of the family including the dog join in.
