D.U.M.B.O. This small riverside pocket in Brooklyn is located near the Manhattan Bridge on the Brooklyn side of the East River. It's narrow streets and old warehouse buildings create the unique views. The Manhattan Bridge hovering over the neighborhood somewhat isolating it from the rest of the city. The appearance of construction and incoming businesses are signs of the fast growth and changing face of this neighborhood.
