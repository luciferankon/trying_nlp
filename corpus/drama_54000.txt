Blind People is about a man Ray who hates his life and will do anything to get back to the one thing he thinks will make his life better; his ex-fianc√© Jamie. To Ray Jamie represents the life he wants but is somehow unable to obtain. Blind People is about those times in our life when we're unable to see beyond our singular focus. Blind People shows the effects of someone not being able to see beyond the singular focus of their problems. Beyond the character driven plot is a deeper meaning though and an argument against a solution that many people choose to solve their problems: suicide. Blind People shows the results of reducing life's problems to their emotional end instead of their logical end.
