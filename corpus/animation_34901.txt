Steve's Quest tells the tale of Steve a young software engineer and his struggles with work love and writing a science fiction novel. Steve reluctantly works at a "cubicle farm" software engineering job only because of his obsession with lovely colleague Sabrina and to support his hobby of writing cyberpunk-themed sci-fi. Setbacks on all of these fronts send Steve on an epic and amusing journey of self-discovery through men's support groups online role-playing games and even the cyberpunk universe of his own creation.
