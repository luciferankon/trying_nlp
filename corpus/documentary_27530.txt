Over 2 millions Japanese have been infected by the Hepatitis C epidemic and each year over 30000 of them lose their lives to it. Through interviews with victims of this disease Fuji TV sheds a light on "fibrinogen" a blood-clotting agent that had been kept away in the dark. Both the Japanese government and pharmaceutical companies say that the Fibrinogen used in the 1980's no longer exists. But we discovered it in a hospital located in the country and tested its genetic level. The tests revealed for the first time that the drug in fact was contaminated with the hepatitis C virus. When this program was aired those infected with Hepatitis C by the blood-clotting agent filed a class action suit against both the government and pharmaceutical companies.
