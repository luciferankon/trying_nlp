Arnold Richter studies physics loves opera and writes novels. Not exactly the hobbies most women find attractive! Time for a change: Somehow it has to be possible to learn how to seduce any woman within a few days. Just like 'Don Giovanni' does in Mozart's opera! Luckily he finds an experienced teacher soon and with each successful seduction more and more 'Don Giovanni'-elements sneak into his world... A satire on today's 'Internet-Generation' and on a young man's flirting-problems mixed with lots of classical music. It allows to get an authentic yet satirical view on young people's lifes today.
