For centuries firefighters have acted as societies heroes. For one New York firefighter Don Eichin water has not only acted as his weapon of safety but also a source of recreation. In New York a strong community of surfers dwell underneath the ashes and uniforms. These warriors have risen about sea-level to conquer fire as well as submerge themselves to dominate water. The only element stronger than their honor and skill is the bond of their brotherhood. Much of the rare footage used in this movie has never been released publicly. It has been buried in a basement for nearly fifty years. It will surely excite historians from New York to Hawaii. With some of the biggest names in surfing history paying homage to these brave men and women. Fire and Water will ignite your heart.
