In a society where money means everything an old man has to avoid the arguments between his sons. They pester the life out of Costel by asking him to sell the house and give them the money. Even on his St. Constantine's day they do the same thing. The old man feels that he is unappreciated and he begins to think if it wouldn't be better for both sides if he was dead.
