Adyashanti delivering a talk in Santa Cruz California decides to break from his usual practice. Instead of telling his audience how to wake up to the truth he tells them what it is like to be awake what it is like to be enlightened. It's not what anyone expects. He delivers the frank news that it is both wonderful and terrible - and reveals some aspects about it that are usually not discussed as they aren't particularly good selling points. After the talk Adyashanti takes three questions from the audience. One is from a young mother who wants to know why she can't stop valuing what she values. The second is from a woman who feels spiritually bored. The last is from a man who asks Adya what he values. He also wants to know how it's possible that all is one when it seems clear to him that everyone is a separate person.
