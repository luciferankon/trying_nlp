A video documentary balancing the experiences of two individuals HIV-positive for two decades against the inspiring work of Phillip Ing and over 1000 volunteers as they prepare the twentieth anniversary of Canada's largest single-day AIDS fundraiser Fashion Cares. In the early 80's HIV/AIDS was labeled as 'the gay plague' quickly earning a chilling reputation as an unstoppable killer. Marginalized by many in mainstream society the gay community faced a choice: unite or suffer alone. This is the story of one of those unifying forces - a fashion fundraiser. It's flourished into something much more powerful that has changed the political landscape and how we see ourselves.
