Grace a young heroin addict and Jamie her alcoholic doctor imprisoned by the horror of addiction and sexual co-dependency take a powerful natural hallucinogenic in order to travel the spiritual road to recovery. Whilst seeking the truth to their present and past behaviour but driven by self-obsession and malevolent denial far from leading to salvation the road they actually travel leads them to a place from which they may never return. A place where the truth is more horrific than the lies they tell themselves. One person from a past that connects them both holds the key to their new place of captivity and that person is in no hurry to leave.
