Ernani was Verdi's fifth opera and is based on Victor Hugo's Hernani. It takes as its starting point the theme of vengeance in all its manifold aspects and received its first performance at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice in March 1844 its success proving Verdi's definite breakthrough as a composer. The fact that the work has been staged with increasing frequency in major opera houses in recent years is due to the renaissance of bel canto singing.
