A weekly reality based television show in which host 'Giel Beelen' (qv) experiences excruciating experiments. All of which are somewhat based on problems and fears in our society. What's it like to be tortured? How dangerous is driving without a good nights rest? Should professional boxing be forbidden? What does it feel like to be buried alive? How safe is a life hammer?
