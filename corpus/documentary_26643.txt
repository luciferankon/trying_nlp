Peruvian anthropologist and painter Ediberto Jiménez visits the villages of the Chungui people of the Peruvian highlands. During the 1980s these people suffered tremendously at the hands of both Maoist guerrillas of the Sendero Luminoso movement as well as Peruvian counter insurgency forces. Interviewing survivors and painting pictures in the style of Guaman Poma a famed 17th century Peruvian chronicler and defender of the indigenous peoples Jiménez gives voice to these people who feel both terribly victimized over the last 30 years and utterly forgotten.
