Asks the question why in the year when the UK celebrates the 50th anniversary of the legalisation of male homosexuality in England and Wales (and when GDS and dating apps have made meeting people easier than ever before) are so many young gay men in the UK struggling with issues such as depression chemsex bulimia homelessness bullying and suicide. Four young men attend a party where they feel safe and happy with each other but we soon see that other problems and issues lay just below the surface. 'Straight Jacket (We Can't Stop)' is a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the legalisation of male homosexuality in England and Wales. But it also questions whether in this current era of equal rights and gay marriage and when dating apps and GPS have given us the opportunity to instantly connect with each other are we actually happy?
