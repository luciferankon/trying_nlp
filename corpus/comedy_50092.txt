Three stoners sitting on a couch flip through the channels finding all sorts of absolutely ridiculous shows. Every once in awhile a catchy music video comes along and the ongoing saga of Gemberling (a cross between Star Wars and Tron) is a fun time. Great when you have the munchies but still funny when you don't.
