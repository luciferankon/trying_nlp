The Feature Film title"-Gutrun Gutargun" is social issue based film. The script was written based on lack of basic sanitation in villages and preference for open defecation a cultural issue in our society. This present movie depicts day to day challenges of women's life in village and also shows disgust and embarrassment women has go through due to lack of toilets at home. So to avoid embarrassment they usually go at dawn and late at night to the only public toilet in the village. To make a documentary on such topic is relatively easy but to make feature film with the mix of entertainment was a task. This is a very clean entertaining and social film. Censor board has given "U" certificate to it .Apart from above festivals we have arranged couple of private screenings and including all such screenings almost 2000-2500 patrons had viewed this film and we had received an outstanding response. I am quite upbeat that our film has the requisite humour (masala) in addition a social message.
