The program shows us the history of the National Action Party (PAN) and how its struggle for democracy and abandonment of its role as an opposition party was carried out upon winning the presidential elections in 2000 thus opening the possibility for political competition in our country. Through the testimony offered by directors militants and historians spectators can come to know the stories of the founders' lives and the internal struggles as well as PAN's victories and failures that they experienced as the party became the second leading political force in Mexico. PAN is a party that continues to give lessons in democracy and struggles to maintain governmental power but above all it sought to maintain the support of the citizens who brought their candidate to the republic's presidency six years earlier.
