Out-of-work cowboys Kansas Jones and Chito Rafferty are offered jobs at pretty Dusty Willis' ranch after saving her from a beating by saloon owner Clint Burrows. Dusty's good-hearted but weak-willed brother Harry adding to his $3000 gambling debt to Willis reluctantly agrees to pay it off by allowing the Ringo Kid Burrows' vicious hired gun to rustle cattle from his sister's ranch. Kansas intervenes deters the rustlers and persuades Harry to confess his involvement to Dusty. Kansas sent into town by Dusty to pay off Harry's debts suddenly finds himself on the wrong side of the law wrongly accused of murder and must rely on Dusty's belief in his innocence for his salvation.
