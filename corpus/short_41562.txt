Sven is 25 and lives in the small village of Altwarp on the German side of the Szczecin Lagoon. Together with a Polish ancillary worker he has to accept a job on a booze-cruise ship that sails several times a day to Neuwarp on the Polish side of the water. Sven soon realizes that his dealings with his friends influence him more than he thinks when he suddenly gets caught between two fronts. A comedy about prejudices and feelings.
