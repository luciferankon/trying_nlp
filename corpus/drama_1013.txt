The story begins in March of 1968 the days of students protests. A hot- headed student protests the Dean's decision to expell a fellow student on fake accusation charges upon which he drops out of university rather than make a compromise. He loses everything in the process: his girlfriend housing privileges - he becomes a coal deliverer. On the job he witnesses an accident that causes death of a fellow worker. He decides to write a story which is good and a publishing house wants to print it but only after some corrections are made. He refuses again and the story is not printed. Finally a story is commercialized and made into a succesful film and brings fame to the original author.
