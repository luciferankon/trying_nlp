Sci-fi. Set in a psychiatrist's office Dr. Wolf (played by Ruben Rabasa) is conversing with an affordability accumulator (AA) suspected of being a prostitute Megan McPherson (played by Josie Martineaux). The AA's name is anonymous because the controlling corporates -- banks and pharmaceuticals have stolen her identity and assigned her a number. 'anonymous (street meat)' is what people become when they drink Hellsy Sip and lose their identity to a small priestly caste of seers with access to the ultimate source of knowledge and the rest of humanity simply tools in their vast schemes. The future could be a digitally supercharged version of the distant past: ancient Egypt multiplied by the power of Facebook.
