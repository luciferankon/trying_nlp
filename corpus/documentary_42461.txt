The Day We Came Together is a revolutionary documentary about how the "impossible" was made possible one day in July. It's about a diverse group of American idealists and a young underdog nonprofit named Rebellious Truths that stood up to the partisanship paradigm the lack of empathy understanding the political misery mud slings and madness in this country. Amidst this often fabricated and misplaced anger in our people and political system these Americans decided to show everyone that we can come together and that WE MUST come together if we are to fix our nation. People from Occupy to Tea Party Republicans to Democrats Liberals to Conservatives Libertarians to Independents and everyone in between sat side by side and had a real raw and value-based conversation about who we really are what we believe in and how to fix our American plight. What happened was nothing less than beautiful. We invite you to create a day like this across the country for the benefit of us all.
