Mr. Zhunzaarrao Shirke (Mohan Agashe) a landlord who claims Veergadh a fort to be his ancestral property. He and many of his earlier generations thought that Veergadh was gifted to their ancestors a confusion that cost them 500 acres of land. Zhunzaarrao swears that until he claims Veergadh he wouldn't let Malhaar (Subodh Bhave) his only son to get married. This puts Malhaar in a fix as he is already engaged to a girl Devki (Hemangi Kavi). Casual meetings between an over excited Malhaar and Devki turn intimate leaving her pregnant. Malhaar goes berserk after knowing this and asks Devki to abort the child which she profoundly refuses. Now Malhaar just can't imagine what his father his highness Zhunzaarrao Shirke can do to him once he gets to know about this.
