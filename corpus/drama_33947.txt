In Rio de Janeiro the twenty year-old virgin dancer Zelinda Barbosa works at TV Globo dancing in TV shows produced by the director Borges. Her obsessive and ambitious mother Ms. Helena advises her daughter to seduce Borges to succeed in her career in television and invites Borges to have dinner with them. Then she proposes Borges who is married with children to ride with Zelinda in his car late night. A couple of days later Zelinda claims to her mother that she is still a virgin but has the symptoms of pregnancy. Ms. Helena takes Zelinda to the gynecologist for medical examination and when the doctor receives the results he tells that Zelinda is virgin and pregnant. He proposes an abortion but Zelinda tells her mother that she intends to lose her virginity with Borges first. While they travel to Cabo Frio the doctor realizes that he made a mistake and the result belongs to another client: Zelinda is not pregnant. Helena unsuccessfully tries to call Zelinda in Cabo Frio to tell her the news before she sleeps with Borges.
