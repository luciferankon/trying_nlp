'Chaiqian' (demolition) is a portrait of urban space migrant labor and ephemeral relationships in the centre of Chengdu the capital of Sichuan province in western China. Attending first to the formal dimensions of the transforming work-site - including the demands of physical labor and the relationship between human and machine - the film shifts focus to the social dynamics of a group of thirty people who have come from the countryside to work in this ever-changing urban landscape. In exploring the various banal yet striking interactions between these members of China's 'floating population' the city's residents and the film-maker 'Chaiqian' simultaneously expresses and resists the fleeting nature of urban experience.
