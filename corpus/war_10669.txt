Margery was with Hitler on his birthday when he was presented with the Tiger Tank. As a singer she was able to remember some critical technical data as a song which was sent back to Bletchley Park for decoding via her controller Hardy Amies and to the delight of Churchill who then ordered the capture of one. She had a narrow escape whilst hiding British airmen and was eventually caught by the Gestapo on the personal orders of Goering after being constantly shadowed by SS thug von MÃ¼ller who eventually tortured her.
