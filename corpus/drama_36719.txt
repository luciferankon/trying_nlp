Based on a true story it is about a struggling young father (Baldwin) who can no longer support his wife and family falling in with a beginning group of white supremacists led by a man (Gallagher) who is obsessed with the "takeover of the Country by whites." All goes well until the shooting starts and this moves Baldwin to turn against the group.
