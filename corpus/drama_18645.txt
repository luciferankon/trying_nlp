A young priest Father Chisholm is sent to China to establish a Catholic parish among the non-Christian Chinese. While his boyhood friend also a priest flourishes in his calling as a priest in a more Christian area of the world Father Chisholm struggles. He encounters hostility isolation disease poverty and a variety of set backs which humble him but make him more determined than ever to succeed. Over the span of many years he gains acceptance and a growing congregation among the Chinese through his quiet determination understanding and patience. In 1938 Father Francis Chisholm is an elderly priest whose sermons don't particularly conform to his Bishop's expectation and is asked to retire. The Monsignor who has delivered the message comes across Father Francis' journals which tell his life story. He is orphaned when his parents are swept down down river during a violent storm and taken in by his Aunt Polly. After the death of his childhood sweetheart he enters the priesthood and is sent by his mentor Bishop Hamish MacNabb as a missionary to China. He arrives to find that his church has burnt to the ground and that he has few adherents other than rice Christians a practice he puts to an immediate end. Establishing himself is a challenge but he is called to care for the son of the local Mandarin. As a thank you the Mandarin gives him a piece of land and pays all of the expenses to build a new compound with not only a church but a schoolhouse and a dispensary. The arrival of three nuns should have lightened his load but his inability to befriend the haughty Mother Superior weighs greatly on his conscience. They survive a war between Imperial and Nationalist troops but a close friend is killed. He returns to Scotland an old man whose view of the world shaped by his life's experience impresses the visiting Monsignor who has spent the night reading his journals.
