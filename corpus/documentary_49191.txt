It's like forcing two different species to fuck! And that's no exaggeration. The record label and music collective Bedroom Community is based in Iceland but draws creative genes from all corners of the world. The collective's multi-talented musicians mix Icelandic American and Australian blood. And it's not just blood but also sources of musical inspiration; a cacophony of classical folk punk electronic and experimental music. We meet four of them in Everything Everywhere All The Time; The modest and Icelandic Valgeir Sigursson both as a musician and the brains of the operation. The quirky and humorous Sam Amidon comes from the US where his Vermont folk-roots go far back. Also from the US Nico Muhly brings the classical side as an excellent pianist and composer. The rough-edged Australian/Icelandic Ben Frost delivers the noise aesthetic. Despite all their different backgrounds Bedroom Community's scattered artistry forms a coherent whole in a joint live-performance; The Whale Watching Tour. Along with a line-up of fantastic musicians this film follows Valgeir Sam Nico and Ben around their recording studio in Iceland and all over Europe and spotlights the challenging and sometimes difficult aspects of collaboration between these diverse individual talents.
