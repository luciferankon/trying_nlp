In the late nineteen-seventies and early eighties South Florida like many parts of the U.S. saw the birth of an explosive original rock scene. It was a time when music was reinventing itself to appeal to a younger more discriminating audience. New Wave Punk and other experimental genres were finding a ready audience and were changing the shape of music forever. Yet Miami's influential rock artists were one of the nation's best-kept secrets. Relegated to the southernmost tip of the state the scene was largely overlooked and eventually forgotten. Until now. On January 28 2007 The Kids Z-Cars Critical Mass Charlie Pickett The Cichlids Slyder Tight Squeeze and special guests The Romantics took the stage at Club Cinema in Pompano Beach Florida to the delight of nearly 3000 fans that came from around the world to see their favorite bands play together one more time. The event culminated in South Florida's biggest reunion concert. The film chronicles the remarkable true story of South Florida's influential rock music scene by combining dozens of exclusive interviews live performances by the bands and vintage video radio broadcasts and photographs. For the very first time this extraordinary untold story has been brought to the forefront and examines the compelling and often personal journey of eight original Miami bands and their quest to leave an indelible mark on the music they loved.
