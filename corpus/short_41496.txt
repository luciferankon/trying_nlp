On a Monday morning after a boring night out clubbing in Berlin-Mitte DJ Poge and his girlfriend Dani drive out of the city into the suburbs to the dormitory town of Marzahn. Mitte is out they are convinced; The future lies in the margins of the city. While searching for a suitable location for a new club they meet Mol an old friend of Poge's who has been living in Marzahn for quite a while now. Two pioneers is one too many.
