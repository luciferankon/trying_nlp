As family legend has it "Salty" Sam Stephenson Pamela Stephenson's great great grandfather was the owner and captain of the sailing ship Rosalie and in the 1820's he was abandoned by his crew and never heard from again. A chance encounter with the descendant of another crew member who had a different story to tell prompted Pamela to search out the fate of her ancestor. Delving into maritime archives she began to piece together his background--from Rotherhithe she retraced his journeys along the old spice route even renting a sailing boat with a heavily armed crew to continue her search in pirate-infested waters. A tale of genealogy and mystery this exploration will thrill history and adventure buffs alike.
