Jesus is kicked out of heaven by his father God after he gets too comfy with his life and slacks on his responsibilities. God thinks by sending Jesus back to earth it will help him learn more responsibility and will teach him how to take care of himself. On Jesus' journey to rediscovery he handles the hardships of being a socialite in Hollywood having a messy roommate and overall just trying to save all of our doomed souls.
