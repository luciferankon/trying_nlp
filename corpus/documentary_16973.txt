Filmmakers Shelly Kapadia and Peter Szijarto and Executive Producer Cyrus Kapadia (The Wages of Sin 2016) are taking on what's been missing from the stories of transgender people. This feature length documentary film will focus on stories of acceptance and non-acceptance for several transgender individuals and their families. In a time when the attempted suicide rate of transgender individuals is over 40% this film illuminates the importance for families to stay connected throughout their loved one's transition. Just as transgender youth and their families must confront their own turning points society is now presented with a similar challenge. Will the tide of acceptance turn and usher in a new era that can put an end to the discrimination? Shot in 4k and finished for theatrical release by Richmond VA production house PigsAlreadyFly TURNING POINT will explore how relationships can be pushed to their limits against the notion of unconditional love.
