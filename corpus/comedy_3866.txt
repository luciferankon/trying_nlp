Ahmet Murat and Sadi are actors who dream of shooting a movie and present a documentary called 'Meslek Hikayeleri' in order to make money. They are aiming to shoot a movie which would break some records after earning enough money. However they had to try harder to shoot a better one when the episode they produced was not issued. Ahmet misses the days he played a leading role in a TV series. He thinks that he is not a well-known actor currently and is always complaining about this situation. Murat is trying to do his best and also finds it difficult to work with his ex-girlfriend who left him several years ago. Sadi had given up working as a customs official before joining the cast of 'Meslek Hikayeleri'. He has to deal with some financial and family problems. Getting his wage is really important for him because he does not have a money source except the series in which he acts as a figurant. However the crew and the producer of the documentary makes it more difficult.
