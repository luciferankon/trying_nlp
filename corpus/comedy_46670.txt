Agoura Hills follows the life of Chief Meteorologist Everett Storm - a weatherman who's afraid to go outside. Everett's overt egotism is a thin veneer for the swirling fear and vulnerability of a man struggling to keep from hitting rock bottom resulting in an absurd and touching story about a man trapped by fear searching for meaning and relevance in a world that doesn't seem to need him.
