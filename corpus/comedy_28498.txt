Cindy is your average non-barbie doll female fighting for her self respect in a world where people pay more attention to her clothes make-up and her body than they do her personality. In order to document her fight against the status quo she enlists her brother Willie to video her wild macabre rants about aging beauty love and of course prescription medications--to vent--to inspire--to be good ol' insane Cindy. Welcome to hell pretty hell.
