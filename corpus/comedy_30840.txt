Grambo is a game in which you can steer an angry old lady through the streets on a quest to get her medication as soon as possible...if only these whipper snappers would just get out of the way. Use your cane as a weapon! Power up with prune juice! Beat your score as you steer your wheelchair away from obstacles and into the nightmares of those who oppose you. Just don't let your blood pressure get too high or it's game over Grambo.
