This film chronicles the director's (Mike Woods) 6 week road trip across the country to capture what happiness sounds like in America. Musicians all across the country and from many genres are asked to play what happiness sounds like to them. The production team records each musician's version of happiness on their respective instruments and joins them together into one fluid piece of music. The participants are given absolutely no limitation on what they can write for use in the film. This gives them full creative control to authentically channel their feeling of happiness and express it through their instrument. Through modern recording software we are able to mix and match these expressions into one seamless movement of sound. The sound of happiness in America.
