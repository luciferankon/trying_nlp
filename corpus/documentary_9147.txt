Documentary about the musical and social phenomenon of Brazilian funk (or Carioca Funk) a style derived from Miami Bass based on repetitive bass drum loops and lyrics full of sexual and violent overtones not directly related to American funk/soul music. This style emerged in the slums and poor neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro and is deeply associated with the lower social classes but is gradually being accepted on higher social circles. The film is specially interested in women's participation focusing on its major female stars.
