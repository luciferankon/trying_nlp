Randolph Spencer and Martin Brubaker were ex-Navy SEALS-turned-mercenaries who hired themselves out as soldiers of fortune for a very high fee. On their missions Spence and Bru relied heavily on Thunder which was a souped-up gadget-ridden speedboat originally built by Spence for the U.S. Government R. J. 'Hurricane' Spencer (Terry 'Hulk' Hogan) and Bru (Chris Lemon) are on a top secret mission to capture the notorious foreign drug lord Santiago. They race 'Thunder' their souped-up boat version of a muscle car at hyperspeed to the island where the dastardly felon lives. Bru & Spence outwit the guards blow open the heavily guarded bunker set in the face of the mountain and capture Santiago. They narrowly escape as 'Thunder' spews a river of flames blocking the path of Santiago's evil right hand man Lee (Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa). In order to force the release of Santiago from prison Lee and his men storm the school of Spence's daughter Jessica take everybody hostage and wire the school with high powered explosives. Spence & Bru's initial attempts at saving the school fail and 'Thunder' comes under the control of the sinister Lee. In a thrilling race against the clock Bru must use all of his superior martial arts skills to regain control of 'Thunder' while Spence must single-handedly battle the remaining terrorists to rescue Jessica before the building blows sky high!
