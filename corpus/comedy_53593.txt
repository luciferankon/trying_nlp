The time: World War II. Hitler and his heinous henchmen join forces with the Japanese and a mysterious evil leader to create a doomsday weapon that will end the war once and for all. The only thing that stands in their way is the brave (and bumbling) American heroes: Happy Charlie Steel and his brother Rex. Joined by the brave and beautiful Laura McShaunnesey a drunken Irish pilot and a pair of song and dance men the fate of the free world is in their hands.
