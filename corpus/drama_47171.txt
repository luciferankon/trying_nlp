Russ Evans A WWII veteran army pilot decides to check up on the widow of an old war buddy of his Elaine Graham. The logging company she inherited is doing poorly but Elaine gets an order in for a huge shipment of lumber. Russ and his friend Squirrel volunteer to help her cut the timber for the shipment along with her friends Smacksie Golden and his girlfriend Lil Boggs who are not used to doing physical labor. Russ pilots the plane to deliver the lumber before the company falls to a slimy businessman. An under-rated highly enjoyable film with a great cast and witty dialogue.
