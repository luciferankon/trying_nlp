One of Columbia's favorite and most-recycled plots involving a "disgraced" lawman crossing the border to clear his name which on five occasions (twice previously with Jones) involved a Texas Ranger crossing the Mexican border to accomplish his goal but this one and two other versions with Charles Starrett and later with Russell Hayden (who also had a Ranger version) has the lead as a Mountie turned bad to join the gang and stays on his side of the border. This one has the Northwest Mounties at Elkhorn failing to catch the perpetrators of a series of robberies and catching much heat from a citizens band of vigilantes headed by Morgan. After being discharged from the service for robbing a rancher Sergeant Tom McKenna ups and robs the Elkhorn bank and is followed by Pierre a member of the gang who takes him to the outlaws' hideout as a new gang member. The robberies and drummed-from-the-service discharge were part of a plan to capture the gang and its secret leader who is always the head of the vigilance committee protesting the loudest against the inability of the sometime Mounties and more-often Rangers to do their job. Caught committing robbery McKenna is kicked out of the Mounties. This lets him join the outlaw gang causing all the trouble. In the gang's next raid when only Pierre and Tom return Tom is in trouble when Pierre gives a letter to his boss identifying Tom as being on a secret mission to bring in the gang and it's leader.
