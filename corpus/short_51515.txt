Gary Gilmore is about to experience this new punishment. Having been found guilty of cold-bloodily killing 3 people in a bad crime goes worse having taken the lives of the innocent store clerk and that of John and Tyrone 2 young punks who had just made another poor judgement in their now short-lived lives. It's too late for Gary to change in this life but maybe not for his next. Thus: "If we can't teach the heart and mind through punishment then let's educate the soul."
