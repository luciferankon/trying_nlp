A visual ballet set to the music of Wagner's Liebestod. Exploration of two female identities (Bulleta/Hellchick). Men are amorphous bulbous creatures (Nella) only capable of experiencing joy through their female counterparts. A tentative resolution is suggested by distant gaze of an older wiser sadder figure (Rabbit) who perceives self doubt of the Bulletas destined through experience to become Hellchicks.
