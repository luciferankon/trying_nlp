25th August 1944;Parisfree at last !and it's my birthday says jailbird Maurice:he is released from the slammer by resistant fighters but he was actually arrested for stealing a bike five years before . When he returns home all is not so rosy.Mother is not prepared to feed him for free at a time when housewives stand in line with their ration card in their hands.So Maurice steals again this time a horse called Berlingot (=hard candy)so as to sell steaks on the black market.Helped by his schoolmate Rolandhe begins the task.He must first find potential customers :butdown on his luckhe meets policemen priests and nymphomaniacs and his future steaks sell poorly.And to kill the horse they have become friends with is too hard..
