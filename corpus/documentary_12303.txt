Suffering from Tunisia's ills a character in the film says: "This revolution is not the result of destitution but rather a cry of despair rising from a generation of graduates. It is neither the bread nor the jasmine revolution... Jasmine does not result in death does not give rise to martyrs. It's the revolution of a people's devotion. We shall never again have any fear for this new Tunisia!" This comment perfectly summarizes Tunisian's frame of mind. That of the youth who made the first revolution of the virtual era as well as the older people who always defied fear in order to resist the yoke of dictatorship.
