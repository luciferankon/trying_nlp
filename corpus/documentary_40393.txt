Follow Friday (#ff) is a documentary about the strangers we trust to help us make day-to-day decisions. What is it about online reviews and recommendations that encourages us to trust the opinions of someone we've never met? How many degrees of separation before we start to doubt the credibility of these people? And if we met these people in real life would we even like them? The film will follow Erin on an 11000-mile 42-day journey across the United States meeting and interviewing 140 of the strangers she listens to every day on Twitter. Will these people be who/what she expects them to be? How well can we really know someone we've only interacted with by tweet? Along the way Erin will make as many decisions as possible based on the recommendations of strangers via social media and web sites. Where to eat places to stop and things to see will all be determined by online interactions. She'll also seek out and speak with experts in the field of social media and discuss the power of online reviews as well as the way these interactions are changing how businesses and consumers communicate.
