A story borne out of independent and alternative author Franco's discomfort and creativity. An aversion to all that is of easy fruition makes Franco vulnerable and puts him against his alter egos: The Writer The Musician The Angry Man. Franco fights to establish himself in a narrative way made of metaphor that borders with the surreal. He is the Scriptwriter the Director the Actor (Franco and his 3 alter egos) the Sound Recordist and the Director of Photography the Gaffer and the Grip the Electrician the Art Designer the Line Producer the Costume Designer the Film Editor the Producer the Sound Designer the VFX Artist the Grader the Composer... on set it was 'always' (and only) him.
