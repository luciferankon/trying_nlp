Boston (Michael McNeill) seems to have his romantic wires crossed because he is forever winding up with screwy women and the girl of his dreams won't even look at him. In this independently made romantic drama the young man turns to women who are as needy as he is and wonders why he does so. Eventually he discovers that the women in his life are like that because he himself is. Even his dream girl has problems of her own as he discovers before the end of the film. ~ Clarke Fountain Rovi
