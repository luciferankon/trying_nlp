From llama costume contests to a giant sing-along to any food on a stick the Minnesota State Fair is juggernaut. Narrator Kevin Kling takes us on a journey to experience the Minnesota State Fair like an insider. We spend time with a young woman who is both a 4-Her and a Dairy Princess. She shows her heifer to skilled judges one day and then gets her head sculpted in a 90 pound block of butter on another. A master salesman takes us behind the scenes while hawking the latest greatest salsa maker to the crowds in the Grandstand. In the Fine Arts Building we encounter a sculptor doing a live demo for the folks who have come to view the winners of the Fine Arts competition. On the other end of the spectrum the Crop Art draws crowds who marvel at the patience it takes to make images out of seeds and grains. Not to be left out we get a little history of the Fair and how it has changed (and not changed) over the years. And of course food and the Midway get prominent placement since a day at the Fair would be sad indeed without these glories.
