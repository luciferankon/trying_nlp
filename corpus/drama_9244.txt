We share Mark's shock pain anger fear humor guilt grief and desire for vengeance and potential redemption and we watch how this all effects his troubled relationship with his wife. We also track the struggles Miguel has facing his responsibility for the shooting. After that hour of terror we discover these three characters 5 months later and experience how their lives have been turned upside down leading to a confrontation with the three of them when Miguel asks for forgiveness for what he did and Mark paralyzed and embittered considers revenge.
