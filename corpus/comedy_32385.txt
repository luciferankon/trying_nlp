When Hanky Pranky (alias Schucks) star of a candid camera TV show loses his job to affirmative action he applies for a job at a stress academy. It's not long before Schucks discovers his new boss Jack Paddaman is as crooked as they come but it's too late: the employment contract is signed and sealed.A year passes and Schucks is no better off. However his candid camera videos which poke fun at all sectors of post-1994 South Africa prove a big hit with stressed-out government ministers. When the president asks Paddaman to make a movie to benefit street children Schucks and his pals do all the hard work while Paddaman plans how he can get hold of the profits from the video sales. Add a scatterbrained secretary a lovelorn traffic cop and a cunning street child and you have a roll-in-the aisles comedy with a distinctly South African flavour.
