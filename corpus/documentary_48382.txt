This program provides the ancient history of Mexico's west and focuses on its cultural and political epicenter Jalisco. It is an intense and contradictory story. The fierce rebellion of ancient indigenous nations and the strong sense of pride shared by Spanish settlers and the American-born European descendants presented enormous obstacles for Mexico City's influence in the west. In spite of its cultural and political differences with the National Palace Jalisco and its gem of a capital Guadalajara would go on to head the majority of the battles which throughout the nineteenth century would give independent Mexico a well-defined face and sense of purpose.
