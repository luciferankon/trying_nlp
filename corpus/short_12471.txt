Being fascinated with psychology and the human mind this film is not a linear story but instead explores the subconscious thought processes of one individual. Often times we replay events or situations over and over in our mind. These 'replays' manifest both in our waking life and in dreams. In this film time and space are flexible as we explore the creation of thoughts memories and what we experience as the world around us.
