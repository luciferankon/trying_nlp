High school student Milad Talebi lacks a father's example and he's too much for his tired exasperated mother. Not even his teachers at school provide him with a role model that he can respect and on top of that they try to impose their authority on the rebellious student through repression and physical force. The young man first tries cigarettes and then drugs and after that he starts stealing in order to pay for them. He loses contact with his friends at school and despite interacting with a dubious street gang he falls ever deeper into isolation. But is he really an outsider who lost everything through his own actions?
