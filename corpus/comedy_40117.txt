'Hold your anger like a baby' advises bipolar psychologist Wilbur Waskowicks. He has just finished his first book 'Anger Vanquished' and hired exuberant temp Francesca to proofread. She has a thing for messy situations: she married her poetry professor Fernando who was fired as a result. Francesca and Wilbur grow intimate and when his book is published abscond to Lake Tahoe for his book launching. Their affair is a brief dysfunctional glimpse of heaven that collides with reality when Wilbur gets the book's dismal reviews. Two other couple's stories intertwine: Joe a screenwriter with three ex-wives four kids assorted between them and Stacey newly pregnant and hoping Joe will get her screenplay to his agent. And then there's Angie and Angelo: her a petite foul-mouthed waitress aspiring to be a vet and him a overly-sensitive boxer who has finally gotten that title fight in Vegas - but not without the juice. Wilbur finding himself separately offended by both Joe and Angelo concocts a plan to get retribution by anonymously setting up a fight between them. In riotous mayhem the fight draws all our characters into a denouement of furiously funny proportions as Wilbur reveals himself to be the biggest asshole of them all.
