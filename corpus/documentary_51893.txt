When the writer Vahé Oshagan died in 2000 the New York Times described him as "the most important poet of his generation." As a poet and fiction writer Oshagan wrote in Western Armenian liberating the language from some of its constraints opening it to larger existential questions but also to the energy of the Armenian vernacular. He also sought to ally his medium with the other arts painting music and in his last prose work photography. He collaborated with the Paris-based painter Archak whose work was included in almost all of Oshagan's works; and with the electronic music composer Ohannes Salibian who re-fashioned two of his poems into sound-text creations. Vahé Oshagan: A Portrait is in the spirit of Oshagan's own esthetic beliefs. Seventeen years after his death Oshagan continues to exert influence on the cultural life of the Armenian diaspora as well as the Republic of Armenia as a new generation of Armenians turns to literary texts that speak to the themes of displacement homeland-diaspora relations and to literary creation in general. Vahé Oshagan: Between Acts is a literary biography of the pre-eminent writer and public intellectual of the modern Armenian diaspora. The film infuses the traditional documentary with visual sound-text and scholarly interpretations of Oshagan's poetry and prose. It features readings and commentary by Oshagan of his own poetry as well as analyses by well-known literary critics Krikor Beledian Krikor Chahinian Marc Nichanian; and electronic compositions by Ohannes Salibian.
