Prisons. Why do we have such a dark fascination for them? Is it the fear of confinement? Sharing a cell with a serial killer? Or being tortured by sadistic guards? Whatever it is the drama of life behind bars has inspired some of the world's greatest movies - from award-winning thrillers to entertaining comedies. For most of us these films are as close as we'll get to experiencing this hidden world. So how accurate are these movies? What really goes on behind locked doors?
