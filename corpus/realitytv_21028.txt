Bar Rescue heads "Back to the Bar" to check up on some of Jon Taffer's most challenging rescues. This "where are they now" special features never before seen footage of what happened after the "Bar Rescue" cameras left town. Taffer and his team follow the revisited bars through an evening shift re-inspect the facilities for cleanliness and answer the question on every "Bar Rescue" fan's mind: "did they follow Jon's advice or not?"
