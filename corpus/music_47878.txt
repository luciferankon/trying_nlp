The classical music industry is changing. As lovers of classical music we are frightened. Our audiences and our funding are shrinking and as other forms of entertainment evolve to become more and more accessible classical music is falling behind. But our product--our music--is as amazing as ever. And so not only are we unwilling to accept the possibility that classical music audiences might continue to shrink--we feel strongly that in this age of internet and media our audiences should actually be growing. Despite its traditional (and often archaic) image classical music is relevant to all of us and we are convinced that exposure is all it really needs in order to thrive.
