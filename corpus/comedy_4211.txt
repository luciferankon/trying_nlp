In an attempt to meet the deadline Evelyn Michaels against Sandra Whitesides her managers and only friend/mother figure objections takes on six show kids ranging from the age of 4 to 17 years of age after flipping through channels and noticing that children's shows are very popular. She does this to help meet her one-year goal and does not intend to keep them on permanently. But as the show goes on her plans change when she grows fond of the children and she ends up committing herself to their careers. The adjustment is huge on both sides as the girls and boys acquire a manager with no managing experience and than each kid brings mamanger/dadanger drama to the table.
