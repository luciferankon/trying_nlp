Better Than Andy is a 'mockumentary' about a weird Finnish artist Mr. Tero Himanka who took the world by storm. The press loved the bad boy of contemporary art and women fell for this handsome blonde from the land of reindeer sauna "sisu" and - okay maybe some other great artists as well. New York documentarist Marian Finder arrives to Finland to meet the legendary artist who is known worldwide for such mind blowing art pieces such as "The Baccanal of The Black Sausage" and widely known (but rarely seen) "Solitude in the Park" performances. Finder soon finds out that there is a thin line between having extraordinary talent and just being a bit off the odd side.
