Jay is ordered to fly Cessna flight 30771 from the States to Sydney with stopovers at Honolulu Pago Pago and Norfolk Island. He's joined by Frank who flies another Cessna. Frank crashes while taking off at Pago Pago so Jay has to find Norfolk Island on his own. He gets lost and almost runs out of fuel. He contacts Gordon Vette by accident the pilot of the ANZ 308 a plane with 88 passengers on board. He and his crew are the only ones who can save Jay. But to save him they first have to find him... It's Christmastime. Jay and Frank must urgently deliver two Cessna crop duster planes on a hop-and-scotch route all the way from San Francisco to Sydney. After Frank crashes on takeoff from Pago Pago Jay decides to resume his journey to the next stop: Norfolk Island. 14 hours later he should be over the island but he gets no reply from the control tower. He then realizes his navigational instruments misguided him. He's therefore lost in the middle of the South Pacific and low on fuel. The only plane in the area is an Air New Zealand flight from Nadi to Auckland. Its veteran Captain is determined to find and guide the lost pilot no matter what it takes.
