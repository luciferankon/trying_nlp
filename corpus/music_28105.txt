A 60 minute Music Video show that aired in Indianapolis on it's PBS station. Collin the Host and Dylan the Director constantly battling with the new station manager Anwell. The format was changed to be less time-intensive and reborn as a studio-only show. Retaining much of the funniness of the older episodes but in a much simpler format.
