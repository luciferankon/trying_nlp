One singer from Paris one singer from Bern two incredibly different characters. These voice artists aim to do more than just sing "nicely". They want to explore and experiment testing their vocal boundaries. Ranging from the deepest abysses to exquisite tones they leave no stone unturned in the quest to express themselves each in their own individual way and always with a generous dose of humour zest and tongue-in-cheek. A chance meeting in 2014 brought the two singers together and they were surprised to discover how much they had in common.
