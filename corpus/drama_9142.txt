Although this movie is about the Playboy magazine there are no erotic scenes. Instead it tells the story of three women who seem to have nothing in common: Abigail is college student at Yale and daughter of one of the professors; Meredith is a married mother and owner of a bowling alley; Janet is a successful broker -- yet all of them decide to pose for the Playboy adult magazine shocking their peers friends and co-workers. They have to suffer the consequences but manage to turn it into a precious experience of life.
