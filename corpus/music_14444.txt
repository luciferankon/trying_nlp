For the rebellious Rockero whose library includes everything from Caf√© Tacvba to System of a Down Mun2 highly recommends a weekly dose of Se Habla Rock hosted by "Renato." An alternative to the overrated trend; On Se Habla Rock you get the best of English/Spanish alternative punk-rock and eclectic music video play. Se Habla Rock reaches all rockeros from hard-core rockers to emo/teenyboppers every Sunday at 11pm ET only on Mun2.
