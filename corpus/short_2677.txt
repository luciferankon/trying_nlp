Money malnourishment royalty and rage. Decadence destruction pride and pain. This is the Sport of Kings. The Sprint King is the creation of brothers Benjamin and James Ducker (BRUVA films). A brutally honest short that exposes the dark and gritty underworld to 'the sport of kings'. The film aims to make the sport accessible and interesting to a new audience the same way 'Black Sawn' did for ballet. To the backdrop of racing this is a story about class prejudice and sheer dedication.
