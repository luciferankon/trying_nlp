After years of jet-setting stylist and entrepreneur Fabio "Fab" Jenkins settles in his father's hometown of Cleveland Ohio with a mission: to help people with their personal style. Assisting him is his Fab Squad consisting of Craig an easygoing sculptor turned hair stylist and Bianca Fab's high-strung younger cousin who traded the business world for a career in skincare and makeup. The team is tested when basketball star Kieron Aimes becomes a spokesperson for new retailer Eternally 16. The store takes the city by storm and changes fashion for the worse with its tacky look-alike clothing. Fab becomes determined to take back the city and goes on a journey to track down Kieron in order to discover who's behind Eternally 16. Can Fab find out before the store takes over the globe?
