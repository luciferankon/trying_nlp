Stony makes a deal with Nye to get the wild horse Cylone for his rodeo circuit. The horse brings in big crowds as no one is able to ride him and collect Nye's prize money. Finally Stony rides him but takes the horse instead of the money. This leads to trouble when Cyclone is set free and Nye and his men go after him.
