In an age before Rogernomics well before The Office there was the afternoon tea fund Golden Kiwi and four o'clock closing: welcome to the early 80s world of the New Zealand Public Service. Gliding On (1981 - 1985) was the first locally-made sitcom to become a bona-fide classic. Inspired by Roger Hall's hit play Glide Time the award-winning series satirised a paper-pushing working life familiar to many Kiwis.
