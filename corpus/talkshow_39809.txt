Captain's Log with Captain Mark Gray (Mark Graves) is a boating safety TV series consisting of twenty 1/2 hour episodes which aired on TLC - The Learning Channel - from 1987 to 1990. Filmed on location in the beautiful Santa Barbara / Channel Islands California area Captain's Log was shot in groups of five (1/2 hour shows) per day with 1 2 or 3 guests per show and with a 3 camera live edit to tape remote studio. The series highlighted "expert boating information / safety guests" and a segment called "Sea Tales" (true stories of bad situations at sea with a safety message ie: How to be better prepared for emergencies or how to avoid a bad situation altogether). "Captain's Log" was the nation's first network prime-time "boating TV series". It was designed to bring new people safely into boating but most importantly Captain's Log was the vehicle and Captain Mark Gray was the first person to merge the billion dollar TV industry with the billion dollar boating industry - which until then had never been brought together in spite of their obvious potential mutual benefit. Captain's Log was the highest compensated show on TLC earning 30 times more than any other TLC series due to its outreach to the previously untapped boating community and it's high ratings (between 4.5 to 6). Captain Mark Gray was also allowed to sign his contracts with TLC yearly vs quarterly. Captain's Log ended it's 3 year run in 1990 when The Discovery Channel bought TLC moved it from the east coast to Denver CO and changed its format from educational to Discovery's brand of "reality" entertainment.
