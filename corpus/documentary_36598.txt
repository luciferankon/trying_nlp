True North: The Sean Swarner Story is an unflinching documentary about one man's relentless quest to prove that nothing is stronger than the human spirit. As a teenager Sean Swarner was diagnosed with two lethal forms of cancer. Both times he was given only weeks to live and both times he fought back and survived but not before the disease claimed one of his lungs. Now he's trekking to the brutal and unforgiving North Pole where temperatures hover around minus 40 degrees. If he makes it he will have completed The Explorers' Grand Slam - climbing the highest peaks on all seven continents and then trekking to the South and North Poles. His feat is daunting but Sean is on a mission- a Mission of Hope. Swarner has dedicated each one of his climbs to the cancer patients he hope to inspire- symbolized by a flag he carries with him to each peak. His exploration to the North Pole is no different. With the help of Vern Yip television personality and interior designer Sean designs the Flag of Hope. Months leading up to his final endeavor Sean takes the Flag of Hope across the country. One by one those affected by cancer put their names and loved ones on the flag. United by one purpose Sean hopes to cover the world in hope. True North: The Sean Swarner Story is a jaw-dropping look at how far a man will go to feel alive and to bring hope to millions of people touched by cancer around the world.
