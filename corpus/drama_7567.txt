Between 1949 and 1975 more than 800 000 German orphans have lived their post-war years in Church Institutions. They have endured terrible abuses. Everyone knew but no one spoke. In 2012 the Church admitted her wrongdoings. The movie tells the story of a German woman (Senta Berger) living in New York coming back to Germany to bear witness in front of a board of enquiry. During her stay she remembers her traumatic experience.
