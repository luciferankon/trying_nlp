Joy to the World ang Prosesyon (Foot Parade is a Joy to the World) a canvass of thirteen short stories weaved together is an unlikely unconscious contemplation of Filipinos on Man's stages of existence - birth life death and resurrection. Because most Filipinos are strongly bounded by Cathocism they usually re-enact these stages in lieu to the life of Jesus Christ in a passion play and a procession or foot parade called the "Via Crucis" during the Holy Week. "Joy to the World ang Prosesyon" is a film of muffled births small lives unknown deaths and unrecognized resurrections of Man.
