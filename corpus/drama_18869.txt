The cargo ship "El Levante" is in a terrible storm. The commander of the ship Captain Alonso studies the situation on the bridge with his helpers officers Esteban Montano and Julio Ruiz. Finally the commander decides to make a stop at a nearby port: Punta Brava. Anchored "El Levante" in the still waters of the port Alonso and Ruiz prepare to spend quietly the evening with a pack of cards and a bottle. Of course they invite Montano although he always a little lonely and dreamy prefers to stay on the deck.
