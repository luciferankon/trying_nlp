Amazon: "It looks like it's going to be a typical 24th December day for suave Creative Director Reggie and perhaps a slightly more memorable one. As Reggie's mind goes into overdrive events unfold into very hilarious circumstances and it seems the day may just end in heartbreak and a gun to Reggie's head." Rotten Tomatoes: "It looks like it's going to be a typical 24th December day for suave Reggie. Things however take an exciting turn for him when his office colleague and the girl he's lusted after for a long time gives him a Christmas present he finds impossible to refuse."
