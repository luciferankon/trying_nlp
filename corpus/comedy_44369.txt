At a job interview she meets Hyuga Toru billionaire CEO of a software firm and head of 'Next Innovation' company but he dismisses her early on because she doesn't meet the requirements: to have job offers from two other companies. Frustrated about the situation and the way she's been treated she snaps at him and starts ranting off all the information she's learned about his company. Not very impressed at her memorization skills her name the same name of a woman he's been looking for years does leave an impression with him. So while he's trying to get a government contract on a population census and information project that he feels quite deeply about he contacts Chihiro and offers her a one day job as he needs someone to memorize the project data and help convince the government official he's never seen eye to eye with but that he hopes will be more inclined to listen to a fellow Tokyo University graduate like Chihiro.
