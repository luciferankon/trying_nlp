An Oceanic Airlines flight loaded with a bevy of beautiful women and studly men including the crew is 'lightly booked' and all are 'bumped up' to first class. Real life married couple Troy and Holly Halston making their screen debut are the first of the entire plane's occupants to join the mile high club in the luxury airliner's lavatory but then get 'interrupted' due to forgetting the lock on the door and 'unexpecting' male passenger catches them only to join the mile 'bi' club in a threesome. The action continues from there in pairs/trios of every combination possible (even the pilots in the cockpit and stewardesses in the galley) including a mind-blowing orgy in the main cabin... which leads us to ask... who's flying the plane?
