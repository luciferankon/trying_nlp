One Bullet Away is a very personal documentary. At its centre is a story that points up the difference between ideals and reality in combat; how Nate Fick chose to defy orders rather than walk away from civilians living under the threat of unexploded bombs. The story underscores his hard-won message - that war is human and demands humanity from its leaders.
