A wide-eyed sister missionary arrives in Austria to begin her 18-month-long mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Despite having to make a few cultural adjustments Sister Taylor meets every challenge with optimism. Her enthusiasm to share the Gospel makes her indomitable until she finds herself with an abrasive companion whom she doesn't understand and doesn't particularly like. This challenge along with the ordinary vicissitudes of missionary life begin to wear on her and thus in the process of sharing the Gospel Sister Taylor finds herself gaining a better understanding of its key precepts: faith repentance forgiveness and charity.
