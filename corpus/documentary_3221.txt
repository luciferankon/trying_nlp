Human Trafficking in the Heartland: It is a sad fact that young people in the Midwest are being abducted and sold for sex. The target ages for these abductions are 11 to 14 years and Iowa has seen an abduction case with a victim as young as age 5. Human trafficking is the second largest criminal industry in the world behind the drug trade and generates $32 billion each year. Interstate highways enable traffickers to move their victims quickly to isolate and disorient them and also to evade detection. This documentary covers human trafficking in four states: Iowa Kansas Missouri and Oklahoma.
