The story of the U.S. effort to build up the Afghan Army the only real exit strategy. A chronicle of the war through the portrait of two Afghans and an American soldier on the volatile Pakistan border. The two cinematographers-directors Tim Grucza and Yuri Maldavski spent one month with the soldiers on a tiny Combat Outpost. Ultimately the film is a look at the absurdity of the war and the impossibility of the fight. It will also explore the psychology motivation and identity of two people fighting a common enemy but radically opposed in their cultures and ways of life.
