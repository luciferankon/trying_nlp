Not That Kind of Christian!! is a feature documentary that explores gay and lesbian Christians' struggle for acceptance in the Episcopal Church the "schism" their defiant activism threatens to bring to worldwide Anglicanism and the ways in which activists such as these can profoundly shape our personal liberties at the highest institutional levels. While the film celebrates the achievements made by queer Anglicans as they fight to transform an oppressive Christian tradition into a modern force of liberation it never excuses the prejudices and abuses of organized religion particularly in an era when the word "faith" is merely code for the nationalistic and homophobic violence organized religion often fosters. As the film's devoutly Christian (and male) interviewees offer an internal critique of Christian patriarchy the film ultimately implies that our best cure for homophobia should come from within the Church the institution most responsible for propagating homophobia.
