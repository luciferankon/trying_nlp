This is the Australian edition of the weakest link where Cornelia Frances keeps contestants on their toes in the same style as Anne Robinson in both the USA and UK versions of the show. Cornelia Frances hosts this Australian adaptation of the UK quiz show sharing the same title where contestants battle for a possible AU$100000 over 8 rounds comprised of 7 rounds where AU$10000 is on offer and a second last round where $30000 is on offer. The game starts off with 9 contestants with one eliminated at the end of each round of general knowledge questions. The 2 remaining players then have one further round where the money is trebled after which they battle it out for the accumulated total bank built up over the previous 8 rounds. At the end of each round the player voted as 'the weakest link' by contestants leave the show via the humilation of 'the walk of shame'. The added interest lies in the host making the experience of less than $10000 per round humiliating to contestants always saying that they can do better the less they bank the meaner she is. Cornelia Frances suits this host role perfectly.
