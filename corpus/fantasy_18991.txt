LARP: The Crow Blade Chronicles is a fantasy parody aimed squarely at the world of Live Action Roleplaying. It follows the adventures of The Crowblades a courageous (sort of... some would say ridiculous) band of "Vikings" as they face everything from elves to ninjas in their quest for The Silver Skull. Join Novice the Noob their newest member (the poor sod) and witness the uncomfortable hilarity as he is dragged from one horrible situation to the next learning first-hand the thrill (and the danger... again sorta) of unleashing his inner nerd. The thrill of LARP!
