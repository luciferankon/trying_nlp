As almost every night Tito is the last one leaving the bar. And as almost every night he has drunk a little bit too much. Don Aquilino as usual is the one who sends him home aware that the routine will be the same the following evening. But tonight is not like any other night. Tonight between insomnia and alcohol not noticing the difference between what's real and what's hallucination or dream Tito will be visited by ghosts from the past. A distant past which remains like an open wound. A wound that he will try to heal the following evening with another visit to the bar.
