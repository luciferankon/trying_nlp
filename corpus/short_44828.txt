Kids are like parrots they absorb hear and watch everything we do and say around them and spit it back in the worst ways possible. In a culture fueled by divorce custody agreements and reality TV it can really have an affect on how the next generations view the 'family unit'. This is the story of a young boy named Randy who is told a bedtime story by his optimistic and old-fashioned grandfather. But before his grandfather can finish the magical stereotypical bedtime story with a 'happily ever after' ending Randy cuts in. Randy declares the story unrealistic leaving his grandfather to ask for Randy's 'realistic' ending. As Randy takes over the bedtime story we're lead down a very cynical and frustrating journey watching as the Prince tries to win over the beautiful Princess. Ultimately Randy ends the story with a terrifying twist leaving his grandfather shocked and worried. The grandfather screams for his daughter Helen declaring that he will never read his grandson another bedtime story.
