June 1989. The comfortable monotony of smalltown life in rural Co. Cavan is thrown into chaos with the suspicious death of a 6-year-old child. At the centre of the rumour mill is Neil Brady a young man with an appetite for the occult or what locals call 'dark stuff'. Twenty years later a floundering TV documentary crew on their final assignment renew interest in the scandal. A young family are being terrorised in their own home by a force they cannot see. Locals are reluctant to talk about the darkest day in their history - as is the presumed-dead Brady when they track him down and coerce him into co-operating with their investigation. Both parties have their own agendas but something is drawing them back to the house. Something sinister lingers.
