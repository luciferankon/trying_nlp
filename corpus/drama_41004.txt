Nino is back in Canada after years of struggle in Hollywood. He's got his big break: leading man in a new film by a very important American director starring opposite the international star Vanessa Luna - and it shoots back in his hometown Toronto. Mario owner of "Il Gatto Nero" - the heart of Little Italy - is throwing a small private after-hours party to celebrate the success of the homecoming immigrant kid making good. Lots of wine and Italian food is on the menu. The guest list is a cross-section of Italian Immigrant life: Leo the contractor who just found out his wife's cheating on him; Frankie who published a tell-all novel about the community; Alberto whose family runs the multicultural radio & television network; Eddie who just had his restaurant foreclosed; Bruno who left a life in the mob to become a chef; Michael a desperate salesman who just might be the guy screwing Leo's wife. And Vince an aging film director recovering from heart surgery who is - through the manipulations of Vanessa Luna - offered the chance to finally make his dream movie. Everybody at the party knows they've blown their first crack at life's game. Over the course of the night buried emotions erupt and old wounds bleed again and everybody gets a second chance. But the big question is "Are they willing to pay the price?" A comedy-drama about life love community and being Italian in a place where the earth is never warm enough for transplanted roots.
