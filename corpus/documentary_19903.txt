The Greatest Fakes are the top acts that bring back Elvis The Beatles Stones T-Rex and more for us and then disappear into anonymity until the next performance. Or do they? Maybe they've grown to look like the originals and live their lives like them. After all it must be confusing to perform as a legend at a sold-out Albert Hall to thousands of adoring fans and not let the adulation rub off on you a bit. We look at the top 'tribute' acts in performance and behind the scenes as they reveal the reality of being a famous fake. This is a programme for all lovers of the music of the 60s and 70s.
