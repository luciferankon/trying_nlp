Human Safari is a wildlife documentary series only the subjects are not animals they're humans. Delivering on the very best of award winning animal films we use the language science and objective lenses of wildlife analysis to explore the fascinating and comedic behavior of amazing humans from all over the globe. We prove that the playing fighting courtship diet rituals and survival tactics among humans is equally if not more mysterious than that of animals. Using the combined methods of an anthropologist and a zoologist British host Jim Piddock travels to incredible destinations around the globe to explore the habitat classify unique human species and reveal insights on how to survive each amazing location. This is a safari like no other welcome to Human Safari. Each episode features the exploration of an extraordinary event or destination. On location our intrepid guide uncovers a wealth of information through the objective format of social and behavioral observation. Through careful interaction and experimentation our guide will identify the dominant species in each habitat and explain the physical adaptations and complex interdependent relationships the species has produced in order to survive and thrive. After these revelations each show climaxes during the apex of the event bringing together everything learned and revealing new astonishing discoveries about these amazing locations. Human Safari expeditions include the desert oasis of Las Vegas Nevada where we hunt down the habitat's most dangerous predators and track a pack of Bachelorettes on their last night running free. We also journey to Sturgis South Dakota to engage the North American Leather Back Hog rider or biker to learn how to survive the greatest motosapien migration in the world. From Urban jungles to the wildest secluded celebrations we will stop at nothing to learn about these wondrous creatures in the name of science.
