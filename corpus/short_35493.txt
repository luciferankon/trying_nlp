The Movie is a short film on Domestic Violence written and produced by Judith Audu. The story throws light on how deep the domestic violence menace has eaten into our society and emphasizes the need for women to speak up and refuse to allow themselves to be put through the agony. There are two families in this short film. While one's home is filled with love the other battles on how to live in peace with a husband that is always battering her. It is tells the story of consistent denial of violence by Kunnbi (Omowunmi Dada) and how a concerned couple Tade (Ani Iyoho) and Funmi (Judith Audu) tried helping their neighbor Kumbi to seek help from her abusive husband Kola (Philip Festus). Directed by Uduak-Ubong Patrick this short film shows the flat refusal of a victim of domestic violence to accept her reality seek help as her neighbors kept on advising and the repercussion of her insistence on saving her face from a society which would rather have women suffer in silence.
