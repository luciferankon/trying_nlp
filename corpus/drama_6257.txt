After a seven year absence Dr. Ram Singh returns to his village intending to sell his land and go back to the city. He finds that the peasants are being mistreated by the local landlord and the landlord's sister Sushma. The doctor and Sushma were once in love but in his absence she has become an embittered widow. Unwilling to see the peasants suffer further Ram decides not to sell and opens a school and a hospital instead. When plague breaks out the doctor saves Sushma's son and the flames of love are rekindled. However social mores prevent any opening of hearts and (unable to express her feelings in any other way) Sushma resorts to further acts of cruelty in order to prevent Ram from leaving. Meanwhile her brother stirs up hostility against the pair by spreading malicious rumours which excite the superstitious villagers leading to a trial and a watery climax.
