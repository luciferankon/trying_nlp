Re-issued in 1964 as "Trouble At Sixteen" by Cinema Associates as part of a double-bill with "Girls Town" (now called "The Innocent and the Damned" and a rather descriptive title considering the cast) this film takes place at an exclusive military academy on Sabre Island (played by Catalina Island) attended by rich young delinquents who think money puts them above the law. Enter Steve Conway there to investigate the death of his son whom he has been told died in an accident. The Mick is quickly in five feet of trouble (over his eyebrows) when he is met with hostility by the school's commandant Major Redfern Kelly and the latter's sweetheart-secretary Jennifer Evans; intimidated by the cadet drill instructor Vince Perley and the P.E. instructor Hack Marlow; attempts are made on his life by a cadet trio known as "The Three Beasts" and he is trapped in a three-against-one fight with rifles although memory fails as to just where Rooney came up with his rifle. Just to keep him tested there is a big-speedboat vs. small-motor boat (Rooney's craft of course) chase in shark-infested waters. That comes right after he makes a startling discovery when he talks to his son's former roommate Chip Hastings.
