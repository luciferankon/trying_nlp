REVRY's first original series "Gayborhood" is a full-length mock-reality series set in Chicago's LGBTQ neighborhood. Using satire and over-the-top humor "Gayborhood" provides an irreverent commentary on the current state of reality TV and queer culture - all seen through the lens of a wacky and outrageous band of friends living in this vibrant neighborhood. Narcissistic drag queens sex addicts "fish out of water" Midwest gay folk and - of course - everyone's favorite love-starved gal pal all make up the Gayborhood.
