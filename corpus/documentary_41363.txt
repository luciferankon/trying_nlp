Documentary which examines the influence of the Bizarre and Straight record labels set up by the musician Frank Zappa. Though the initial idea behind the imprints was to provide Zappa with artistic independence by freeing him from his present record contract the label founder poured every bit as much energy and enthusiasm into the records released by other artists as he did his own. The labels provided a home to Alice Cooper Captain Beefheart and Tim Buckley among others and have become an integral part of rock music history.
