See My Dreams Come True is a poetic work exploring the relationship between Black youth and the liberating potential of an unshackled body and imagination. Particularly it is the tale of two Ancestor Spirit Children from 19th and 20th century America who visit a Young Artist in his dreams; and through their own warping of time through their own joys push the Young Artist to confront his art.
