Twincest tells the story of identical twins Dominic and Daniel who are separated from their adulterous lesbian mother shortly after their birth in 1950. While Dominic has the good fortune to be raised by loving grandparents in Quebec City Daniel is raised in a monastery by a depraved priest. Twenty-one years later unaware of each other's existence the two young men are brought together and are soon engulfed in a tempestuous mix of sex revenge and redemption. The project is inspired by the works of Hitchcock Brian De Palma Jean Cocteau and Ingmar Bergman.
