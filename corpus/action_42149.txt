On August 2nd 1980 in the beautiful Italian city of Bologna a young 19 year old man by the name of Francis Raleigh was witness to a horrifying event when the town railway station was blown up by alleged communist terrorists killing 85 men women and children and leaving more than 200 injured many impaired for life. Raleigh's intention was to elicit from the survivors and some of the men responsible for planting the bomb how the events of that day effected and changed their lives and what was their perspective with the passing of the years. So began a dangerous game of cat and mouse that took Raleigh and his companion backward and forward across the European continent in a desperate attempt to stay ahead of their hunters whose mission was to silence them before the truth was out.
