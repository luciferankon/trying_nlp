A poor medical student Petros works as a waiter to make ends meet. So he accepts the enticing proposal of Kostas Fragkopoulos a well-off customer to marry his sister Liza with the promise of a "scholarship" to continue his studies in London. While there Petros finds out that his wife has died and immediately returns to Athens but her relatives don't want to have anything to do with him anymore. He starts working in a hospital and one day sees his wife again learning that her supposed death was part of a plot by her brother to misappropriate the inheritance of a relative of theirs. Disappointed and deeply embittered he devotes himself to his work and becomes very successful without knowing however that he has a daughter. Several years later after Petros has become a famous heart surgeon the sick Mr. Fragkopoulos dies in his care and his wife Efi accuses him of murder by malpractice. As a result Petros is arrested. In court he is defended by a young lawyer Anna and is supported by those who hold him in high esteem including the director of the hospital and his friend Fotis. While celebrating his acquittal Petros learns that Anna is his daughter. Next comes his reunion with Liza who has never stopped loving him. Happiness and rewards - but also rather exaggerated melodrama.
