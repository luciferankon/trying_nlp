During the 1930's the Mexican film industry was consolidated as a productive industry. Nevertheless from that first moment there were actors and producers of the motion picture industry who worked on the margins of the studios and production companies. Films that have been made and continue to be made by these directors who work outside of the main channels of production have shown over the course of seven decades the aesthetic tendencies or political concerns of their authors who opted to makes films which are different and independent: the other cinema.
