The documentary is a road-boat movie in 6 typical cities of Zhejiang Province in South Eastern China. The journey starts from Hangzhou a modern city and ends in Xitang an ancient water town in a hide and seek game between the camera and Chin-Chin a little girl who prefers to take a walk to the old town rather than going to school. The camera becomes the spectator's eye aiming to hypnotize in such a way that you don't really know if people are traveling in the picture or the picture is moving in their heart.
