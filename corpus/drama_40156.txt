Yuto Kobayashi stars as a down-on-his-luck 16-year-old named Ryo Kawai. Ryo grew up fatherless and has been trying to make a living by working at a local convenience store ever since his mother was hospitalized with a prolonged illness. Unable to support himself on his meager earnings he has to resort to sneaking money from the cash register and stealing rice balls to get by-a habit which eventually gets him fired. Just when it seems things can't get any worse his mother dies and he's stuck with a hefty bill for the hospital and funeral expenses. Obviously unable to pay but determined to send his mother off himself Ryo steals her corpse and places it in a small rowboat. After the makeshift funeral ceremony Ryo heads off to Tokyo on a journey to meet his absentee father.
