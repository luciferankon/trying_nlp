Birth of the Sun is a short documentary about Grady Alexis an unknown artist in the East Village who inspired many struggled to develop a unique vision and finally died in a street scuffle with an off-duty policeman. True to the kind of hand-made and found-object paintings and sculpture that Grady created his story is told through the art and music of people who knew and were influenced by him. The film also documents the recreation of a signature work by Grady the mural called "Birth of the Sun" which originally hung at El Taller Latino Americano where he was artist in residence until his death.
