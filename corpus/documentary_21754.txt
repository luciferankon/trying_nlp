Civil War reenactors gather on the original battlefield at Sayler's Creek Virginia to recreate this historic battle. This is the story of not only the history of Battle of Little Sayler's Creek but the fierce allegiance held by the reenactors on each side of the battle to this day. Sayler's Creek - April 6th 1865 - was one of the last battles of the American Civil War culminating three days later in General Lee's surrender at Appomattox. This was the largest surrender without terms in American military history.
