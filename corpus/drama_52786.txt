Anna Blume a girl in her early 20s is absolutly fed up with her job at a supermarket is offered a strange job by dentist Dr. Thal. For 2500 DM a month she shall live at his big house and shall do absolutely nothing. She can quit at any time with her salary continuing for six months. At first she rejects but finally accepts. She can not understand Dr. Thal's motive and soon notices that he does not show (and probably doesn't have) any emotions. Inspite of this she falls in love with him and finally lands in his bed. Yet his emotionless behaviour drives her away the same night. But she can not get over her feelings for him. To get back to him she fakes pregnancy and that leads to personal disaster for several people.
