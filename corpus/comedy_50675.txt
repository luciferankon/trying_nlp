Joe and Baggy are two misfit English film school students whose first movie goes awry. Desperate to finance their flick they turn to a porn producer who agrees to give them the money needed in exchanges for the guys to cast a semi-retired adult film star named Candy (Carmen Electra). Though Candy agrees to the deal but Joe and Baggy's efforts to make their own movie morphs into a raunchy show which they use Joe's suburban parents house as their set.
