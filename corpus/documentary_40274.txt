Covering nearly half a century of Dale Chihuly's work Chihuly Outside documents his career as an installation artist in particular his work done out in the landscape. The film begins with Chihuly's early experiments with floating glass on water and using ice and neon in large-scale installations as well as projects done at Artpark in upstate New York. It culminates with Chihuly's decade-long cycle of exhibitions at twelve preeminent gardens. This in-depth documentary encompasses one of the most vital and long-lasting aspects of Chihuly's career with interviews by Kiki Smith Barbara Rose and Chihuly among others which places this work within the broader context of contemporary art. What emerges is a portrait of an artist who is continually searching for new possibilities and innovative ways in which his art can respond to natural spaces and glass can be used to move provoke and inspire.
