A family friend intervened and recommended Johnny Carson for a staff announcer job at KNXT-TV in L.A. This opportunity was parlayed into a Sunday afternoon broadcast budgeted at 25 dollars per show called Carson's Cellar. Among the Cellar's avid fans was a fellow named Red Skelton who hired the witty young man as a writer and supporting player on his CBS-TV program. While still writing for Skelton Cason had a few other on air adventures at KNXT including the five minute 'Carson's Coffee Break'. Carson had invited Red as a guest for several weeks in a row and Red came but was never allowed to speak as they always ran out of time. Finally Skelton tied Johnny up and took over. There used to be a standard practice in the TV industry for a Non-Speaking talent anyone who appeared but did not speak. They were paid far less than scale which was mandated for anyone appearing on TV having lines. Johnny convinced ButterNut he could get Red on the show as a regular however by not allowing Red to say any lines. Thus he did not have to pay Red very much money and ButterNut sponsored Johnny's Show agreeing that Red was going to appear.
