Perry and crew visit Seaworld in San Diego where he duets with guest Debby Boone and we learn that she is his real-life goddaughter. Kenny Rodgers also joins the fun along with music director Nick Perito. We get to see Perry being kissed by Shamu the killer whale and sprayed by Flo the walrus. He also presides over a performance by Seamore the sea lion. Como ends this Easter special by singing The Lord'd Prayer.
