Down-on-their-luck best friends Ashley and Madison struggle with their attempt to find a home... that doesn't get parking tickets. When they can no longer handle the perils of living in Wanda (Madison's crappy car) Ashley and Madison search for decent dwellings encountering a parade of Los Angeles' "unique" individuals along the way. Finally they arrive at what looks like a promising prospect at the home of the lonely 80-something widow Edna Harboth.
