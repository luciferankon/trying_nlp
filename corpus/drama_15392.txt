Phillip is thrown into a moral crisis by his friend Chuck when the two go to a party together in search of female companionship. While Chuck strikes out Phillip seems to have luck with flirtatious Jessica. When Chuck convinces Phillip to push things further than Jessica is comfortable with the guys abruptly leave the party much to Phillip's embarrassment and growing sense of guilt. This is further complicated when the two stumble upon a seemingly overdosed girl Amber. From there on the question arises: what to do with the 'body' of a girl who may be alive but is being ignored by Chuck's callousness or may be dead and keeps popping up as the voice of Phillip's ever-evaporating conscience.
