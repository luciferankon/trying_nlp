A documentary about the legendary and notorious Starck Club in Dallas TX. The Starck Club was world renowned designer Philippe Starck's first major design in North America. In addition it was ground zero for the popularization of the dance drug MDMA aka ecstasy. 1984! The year of the famous Orwell novel the year Apple introduced Mac computers via the famous Ridley Scott commercial and the year Ronald Reagan won in a Presidential landslide. In fact the Republican National Convention was hosted in Dallas Texas. Also in Dallas the seeds were sown for the beginning of the entire rave/ecstasy scene in a night club on the northwest edge of downtown. That place was the notorious Starck Club (so-called because it was the first major project designed by Philippe Starck; it put him on the map in the United States). The Starck Club opened in Dallas on May 12 1984 and not long after hosted the GOP in the form of a "Starcktari" party complete with a baby elephant! Ironically it was actually legal to buy MDMA (aka ecstasy) there; people would put it on their credit cards. However the DEA stepped in and made it a 'category 1' drug on July 1 1985. Aside from being ground-zero for the popularization of the designer drug the club was so much more. Philippe Starck is now a world renowned designer but until his foray in Dallas he was only an up-and-coming Parisian designer virtually unknown outside of France. After the club he went on to design the Hotel Royalton in New York as well as the SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills in which he currently has an exclusive ten year contract. In addition the mid '80s brought about a new second British invasion and the birth of new wave music: Dead or Alive Book of Love Prince Grace Jones Karen Finley and a whole slew of new bands and artists performed there. Dallas in the 1980s was fast becoming a world-class city.
