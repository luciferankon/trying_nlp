Tom O'Halloran's Christchurch-shot silent Super 8 film One Way to the Sea posits a dystopian nightmare in the earthquake-struck city. Featuring a man enslaved to a depressingly quotidian routine who is haunted by dark and disturbing images O'Halloran's film combines the malevolent and the mundane in a style reminiscent of the early works of David Lynch.
