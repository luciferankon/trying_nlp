This film explores a theory that has shaped international and military law for hundreds of years and examines whether the current war in Afghanistan which has gone on for nearly as long as both world wars combined is a 'just war'. A film described by General Lord Guthrie Former Head of the British Army as "a skillful timely and succinct exposition of the challenges faced by those who have the terrible responsibility of engaging in a war and how those who are engaged should behave".
