To the rhythm of music that sounds a bit like a Busby Berkeley tune lines and circles appear against a black background. Then triangles in groups. Black and white squares move in tandem. Sparkling forms turn in kaleidoscopic patterns. Then cubes appear white against the background bouncing; a ying and yang rotate a few times before the film ends with an quick burst of scattering light.
