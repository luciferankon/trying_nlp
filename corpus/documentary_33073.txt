They said it was too cold that it was only for the hardcore elites and the insane. Winter cycling they declared just isn't something you do in Calgary. Despite the naysayers hundreds of Calgarians put on their mittens and toques and pedal off to work every winter. From old to young riding clunkers or high-end road bikes cyclists in Calgary keep the bike lanes busy all year round. "Bicicles" is a film celebrating those people who refuse to stop biking in the face of snow and sleet. Filmed during the winters of 2014 - 2016 the documentary follows four "brave" souls on their typical winter commute. Along with interviews with city councillors business organizations and everyday cyclists "Bicicles" explores how winter cycling is becoming mainstream in a city full of drivers.
