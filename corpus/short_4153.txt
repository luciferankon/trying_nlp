Skinside Out -- by Bill Brand and Katy Martin -- features paint on skin carried out in an expressionist mode on both of the filmmakers' bodies. The emphasis is on the pleasure of looking -- at the edge of repulsion -- and the implications of making public an essentially private gesture. The film posits painting as a gendered bodily act whose location shifts continually within a context that's always changing. Images filmed in the studio are juxtaposed with footage of a construction barge along the Hudson. By examining both in relation to surface the work paradoxically looks for what lies within while questioning who and where we take ourselves to be.
