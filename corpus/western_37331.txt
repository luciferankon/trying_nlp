Big Robert Hundar plays a gunman but with a heart though. Turns down a job to kill a doctor when he finds out he is working for the poor people of the revolution. Fernando Sancho is on cheeky clever form who lives with his mother who likes to smoke a mean cigar. Chirpy upbeat score. Mixes lone gunman themes with Zapata elements in a nice simple way and it works.
