Neurotic interior designer Bridget heads out to meet her eclectic best friend from yesteryear Sophie. Now a moderately famous 'vlogger' Sophie has invited Bridget to meet for the first time in a long time to celebrate the imminent publication of her book 'She's Just a Girl and So Am I'. It would've been a typically awkward reunion but when Sophie reveals a truth that means Bridget can no longer see her again the day takes on more significance than each woman expected.
