Canada's Tamil community is said to constitute the largest outside of Sri Lanka -300000- (three hundred thousand) and like most immigrants the majority of Sri Lankan Tamils are peace loving hard working and are interested in their kids getting a better education. Lalita Krishna uses a multi layered approach to tell the full story. In all the rhetoric around wars and rights the price paid by innocent commoners is often missed out. Lalita Krishna uses the stories of Ranjana a hard working housewife who left all her belongings and walked with small kids in tow to seek refuge and to raise her children in a peaceful society. Bhaskaran has a harrowing tale of escape through many illegal boats and being left to die in a small dingy in the Atlantic ocean. Were it not for the kindness of Gus Dalton and his crew in New Foundland the 150 Tamils would have drowned. The third thread of the documentary follows a play Not by our Tears by noted Tamil poet R.Cheran. We get the history and anecdotal events by which Tamils were systematically marginalized through political legislation and government bias which led to bloody conflict and loss of innocent human lives. The documentary is well summed up by Ranjana's mother; 'God turned his eyes he couldn't bare to see the destruction."
