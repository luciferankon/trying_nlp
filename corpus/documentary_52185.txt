When Moors murderer Myra Hindley died on 15 November she was Britain's longest serving woman prisoner - spending 36 years in jail. Hindley was jailed for life in 1966 for murdering two children with her lover Ian Brady. Their bodies were buried on Saddleworth Moor where she later confessed to killing two more. In Hattersley and across Greater Manchester there is little or no sympathy for Hindley who has been branded the 'personification of evil. Some say her crimes were so heinous that a whole life sentence was the only suitable punishment. Others say Hindley had repented of her crimes and as a reformed character should have been released.
