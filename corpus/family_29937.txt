Schoolboy Jordi has to work two jobs as hospital cleaner and car-wash attendant. Still he bends over backwards to help his classmates especially utter ingrate Melissa. The spoiled but emotional daughter of a snobbish pa who looks down on 'common horny' Jordi by her own admission has only one talent: dancing. When she gets a chance to dance in a video she shamelessly abuses and ignores Jordi. Instead she hooks up with other dancers who drag her along in ecstasy abuse 'to dance better'. Soon she's such a social and medical mess even dad comes beg Jordi to help find and cure her.
