The true story of Otomo a Black man seeking work and asylum in the German city of Stuttgart. However all he finds is racism police trouble and his final destiny. His one-day journey leads him to a run-down temporary employment agency where he is being rejected because he doesn't own an ID and proper shoes. Downcast he continues his purposeless trip. In a streetcar he encounters a racist trolley controller who wrongfully accuses him of having an invalid ticket. As the situation escalates Otomo head-butts the controller and flees. With the police on his heels Otomo decides to leave the country. He runs into a truck driver who is inclined to take Otomo to the Netherlands if he pays him 400 Deutsche Mark in advance - a load of money he doesn't have. His need of money leads to desperate measures but also to a new love. However Otomo's bloody final encounter with the police is not too far away. Inspired by an illegal Black African immigrant named Otomo who struck a train conductor in Stuttgart in the morning after an argument about the validity of a train pass in a certain zone. Uncertainty about the pass and his past & future haunt the audience. He was caught on a bridge a few hours later. In this tale we first see him not get a temporary job because he does not have proper shoes. He moves on rather aimlessly when he encounters a train conductor who accuses him of having a ticket that is not valid past the next stop. They argue and Otomo head butts the conductor and runs away. We never know if the ticket was valid. Now that the police are looking for him he hides out for a while then tries to make his way to Holland. He stumbles across a trucker who will take him there for 400 Deutsche Mark. He has little time to come up with that kind of money but as luck would have it his desperation leads to an opportunity which then leads him to the known end of the real story.
