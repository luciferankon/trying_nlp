The film tells of faithful devotion to spiritual ideals. It is based on Riga St. Anna Stocken's Life Story of the Cistercian Monastery of Mary Magdalene. She lived in the 16th century when the wave of reformation was cold before Riga and questions about true values and conformism were just as actual as it may be today.
