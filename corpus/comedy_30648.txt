Swiss family man Marcel Huber is off with his wife and two kids to a nice vacation in the hotel Amsterdam in Rome. Too late they realise their travel agency has made a booking error. Instead to Italy the four are sent to the hotel Roma in Amsterdam: a sleazy establishment where rooms are rent by the hour. Their suitcases misplaced by the airline and stuck in a hotel in the Red Light District the family is at the point of total despair. Then the strangely attentive Swiss/Dutch Playboy Jaap steps in to help. He makes a business offer Marcel can hardly refuse. More trouble follows and family Huber must stand united to overcome all obstacles or it will break apart.
