This delightful Christmas story is of an old actor and his little daughter. They have fallen upon evil days and Christmas is approaching. The little girl begs her dad to write to Santa Claus for some presents. The old man goes into the street to hide his grief from his little daughter over his inability to provide for her. Outside he meets some of his old-time friends and tells his story. They quickly arrange a benefit and on Christmas Eve when the little girl is dreaming that Santa Claus is coming down the chimney with his pack loaded with gifts her father and his friends are rapidly getting ready to play Santa Clans to his little girl when she awakes.
