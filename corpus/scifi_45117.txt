In the near future a team is sent on a dangerous mission to Europa to retrieve and bring water back to a dying Earth. Their operation unexpectedly goes awry jeopardizing not only the lives of those on board but also on earth resulting in the possible extinction of the human race. This movie starts out with a plausible enough plot but as things continue they get progressively weirder. In what I would call the middle part of the movie the situation degrees into a more or less expected eventuality. Towards the end the situation is not ideal but there is still some hope of a good ending. In the last minute of the film everything goes completely whacko and ends with a few seconds of difficult or impossible to understand audio and visuals. In my opinion a very unsatisfying ending. Overall I do not recommend this movie as it has very little of no redeeming value and can be called nothing but a HORROR MOVIE in retrospect. I am very sorry I purchased the movie from iTunes.
