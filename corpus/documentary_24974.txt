The filmed diary of a filmmaker on a journey through Ecuador Peru and Bolivia. With an essay-like composition 'Into the Blue' revolves around two basic hubs Man and Nature and the relationship between the two. The film is a critical reflection on the increasingly more pronounced distance between Man and Nature and the negative consequences of today's current model of development which is highly unsustainable and antagonistic. 'Into the Blue' is an intimist and contemplative film; a poem dedicated to nature and to life free of artificiality and a portrayal of an excluded and marginalized humanity.
