Ellen Pearson directs a collaborative project exploring the everyday experiences of Tilly Lawless a sex worker in Sydney's decriminalised sex industry understood within the context of society's taboos and an ever increasing call for international decriminalisation of the profession. Unlike previous documentation of sex work it welcomes the viewer into Tilly's world as a confidant rather than as a voyeur.
