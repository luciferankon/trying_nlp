At the funeral of his schoolmate the nearly-fifty-year old architect Jirí Mánek ('Václav Voska' (qv)) meets his former close acquaintance - physician Jarmila ('Blanka Bohdanová' (qv)). They both are still single. Jarmila has recently returned to Prague after years of work on the frontier. Jirí leaves for a business trip. As a conservationist he is to grant permission for an adaptation of a Baroque château to office spaces. On the road a pretty young hitchhiker named Eva ('Ida Rapaicová' (qv)) stops him. Eva is Slovak and her spontaneous behavior enchants Jirí. He thus does not mind making a short detour and takes Eva all the way to the luxurious cottage of her parents. A romance develops between the two people so different in age and temperament.
