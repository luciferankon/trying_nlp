Gruesome story of five people who took part in the war in Ukraine. Thirty pieces of silver for the death of a brother. An artificial limb thrown on the judge's desk instead of documents. Separatists in charge and rampant local corruption. Rape in captivity. Imprisonment for false accusations and hunger strike to the point of death. A wheelchair-bound survivor brings a manifesto to Kyiv-a manifesto written in blood-to recite it at the Maidan and lay it on the President's desk.
