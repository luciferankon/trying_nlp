The Universal Fight Game League (UFGL) is the latest brain child of MMA pioneer and innovator Frederico Lapenda the first person to hold a Youtube Pay-Per-View and who spearheaded the worldwide growth of the sport throughout the '90s. The UFGL's goal based on Lapenda's original and groundbreaking World Vale Tudo Championships (WVC) is to give unknown but deserving fighters the opportunity to gain experience and get exposure in order to attract sponsors and help build their careers. Just as in the WVC which built the names of such mega-stars as Mark Kerr Pedro Rizzo Igor Vovchanchin Heath Herring and many others the UFGL cage is the place to see the superstars of the future today.
