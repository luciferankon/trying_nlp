This is one of the cleverest trick pictures which has ever been put on the market and as a means of entertainment it is without a peer for it shows all the rulers of the world in caricature embracing the pet hobby for which each one has become famous. In the first picture we see an old conjurer appear upon the stage accompanied by two assistants who place a large frame in the foreground. Then they take some boiling fluid from a pan and by the aid of magic they form the bodies of each one of the rulers in characteristic attire. This accomplished they next proceed to make the heads and out of the pan come the funny pictures of each ruler. The heads are then placed upon the shoulders of their owner and the grotesque group forms a very amusing sight.
