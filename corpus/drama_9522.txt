Inspired by the masterpiece of concrete music "Symphony for one man" Pierre Henry (1950) the film tells the story of a common man leaving the interior of Brazil to try life in SÄƒo Paulo. The city in its perpetual process of construction and deconstruction view from the microcosm of a construction site its workers and a profusion of machines in full swing. The metaphysical revolt of this character is the revolt against his condition and against everything that humiliates him.
