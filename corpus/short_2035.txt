POSTCARD FROM THE EDGE is a short but intimate portrait of the Dutch painter MARCELLE HANSELAAR directed by German filmmaker and artist Thomas VÃ¶lker. The film was made on the occasion of Hanselaar's Solo Show "Walking The Line" which took place at Kings Place Gallery London between May and June 2013. From the exhibition catalogue: Marcelle Hanselaar's familiar theme the conflicting awareness and subsequent struggle with the balance of how we see ourselves and how we appear to others has now found a bigger arena. Her gripping paintings of a solitary figure with or without props are still there but now for the first time she takes this theme into the public realm something she has freely explored in her large etchings but never before in her paintings. The result is a Breughel-esque tableau vivant. Hanselaar says "I am fascinated by the phenomena of crowds how the shift from private to collective behavior creates a shift of inner boundaries as well. Our familiar sense of inner and outer or personal and social responsibilities and its subsequent behavior shrinks and expands simultaneously and creates temporarily a different set of references from which we then function." Marcelle Hanselaar has won many awards both for her prints and her paintings. Her work is in important public collections including the British Museum the Victoria & Albert Museum the National Art Library and the Ruth Borchard Self-Portrait Collection.
