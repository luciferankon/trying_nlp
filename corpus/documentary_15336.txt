In Manipur in northeast India the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA has been in force for more than half a century. The Act gives Indian armed forces special emergency powers including the sanction to kill people with impunity in the name of 'national security'. Thousands of women have lost their husbands and sons as a result of this out-dated colonial Act while the perpetrators of these grave human rights violations are rewarded with promotions and gallantry awards. Some of these grieving women formed an organisation EEVFAM to find support in each other and become stronger as a group. This film follows a group of members as they are assisted through a trauma workshop towards healing and empowerment to find a stronger voice as human rights defenders and peace builders in their troubled state.
