The project is inspired by an ancient tradition linked to marriage which still lives on in the collective memory of the South of Italy although no longer practiced. The tradition was to display the blood-stained bed sheet from the window after the wedding night in order to demonstrate the woman's virginity. The story of the bed sheet is not a real story but rather a tale only a few sentences long which never did really explain anything but generated somewhat unsettling images about the wedding night and the end of virginity. This lack of stories surrounding the custom led us on one hand to go and meet the oldest women to gather their testimonies and on the other to invite them to take part in a liberating and iconoclastic gesture to be undertaken all together in the square. In the main town square for this is the public space par excellence where traditionally women have always been given precious little visibility. Instead in this case the women actually become performing artists for a brief time. Just to have fun like those American artists who consecrated gesturing in contemporary art while these women were out breaking their backs in the countryside or to transcend like Oriental masters capable in a single move of shifting... a few kilos of tradition.
