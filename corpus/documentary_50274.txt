There isn't a man who in certain life circumstances won't have some mental problem. People who are mentally ill are often too conscentious hypersensitive always available to others prone to doing good deeds solving other people's problems... These are our children relatives and friends who at one point had a point of breakdown. After that point life totally changes. Society rejects the person and then it is necessary to build everything from scratch. If you are alone you will fail but if you have someone with whom to share the same problems everthing changes.
