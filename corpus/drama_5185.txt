The reason there are such glaring continuity problems is that the film was shot originally WITHOUT sexual content. It was evaluated by the producer and it was suggested that sexual content be added. Scenes were shot and simply plugged in. One glaring example is where two of the leads are conversing at a bar. Damiano added a fully nude dancer supposedly dancing on the bar - neither character ever even glance in her direction - because she wasn't there originally. I was there with the score composer and Damiano as work was being combined on the Moviola.
