In this series viewers sent in questions about science and a regular panel of scientists like the manically enthusiastic Magnus Pyke stepped up to the challenge to supply the answers. However rather than simply telling the answers this series went the extra mile with wild demonstrations of the scientific facts in question. Whether it was shooting a woman out of a cannon to see she could be squashed shorter or putting water soluble foam rabbits into a hat this series made science education a fun experience.
