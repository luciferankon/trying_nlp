CIA analyst Sidney Porter is a man living two lives. One as a powerful operative of the agency's clandestine Special Activities Division. The other as an elusive policy obsessed former patriot whose fury at the widening gap between his government's policies and his own political ideals has him siphoning millions of dollars of the agency's money in order to fund his personal political agenda. As the very agency that employs him begins to investigate the missing funds the walls start closing in. It's too late for Sidney to reverse course; he's come too far. He is now a political Robin Hood. He is his own Commander-In-Chief and he's addicted to the influence he wields. Sid has to stay one step ahead of his colleagues and two steps ahead of his own demons as he becomes a nation of one.
