Grandpa why did they try to kill you? The documentary addresses the animic changes that the filmmaker experiences while he tries to understand the participation that his grandfather played as a civil associate during the last military dictatorship in Argentina. The role that he played as the Dean of the Architecture Faculty at the University of Buenos Aires as a link with the concentration camp ESMA is one of the multiple topics that grandpa "Pico" narrates in camera.
