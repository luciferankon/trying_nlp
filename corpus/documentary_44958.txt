'The Area' is an intimate odyssey of one neighborhood on Chicago's South Side where more than 400 African-American families are being displaced to make way for an intermodal freight yard. The film follows homeowner-turned-activist Deborah Payne who vows to be "the last house standing" and the RowRow Boys teen friends who must start a new life across gang lines.
