The English seaside town of Brighton in all its festive bohemian campaigning glory has inspired a remarkable fusion of silent film and music by filmmaker Lizzie Thynne and composer Ed Hughes. Drawing on such precedents as Walter Ruttmann's 1927 silent classic Berlin: Symphony of a Great City this new film depicts a day in the life of the city darting back and forth through time to encompass archive of the forgotten histories and contemporary events that have defined this raffish town on the English seaside. A kaleidoscope of local identities from is accompanied by a sumptuous symphonic score performed by principal players from the Orchestra of Sound and Light.
