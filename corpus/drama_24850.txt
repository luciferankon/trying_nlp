Jewel and Adam are two totally different Los Angeles teenagers who meet and fall in love with one another at first sight. But their sudden romance is threatened by the different feuding families they come from. Jewel's liberal Jewish father Larry Goldman is an entrepreneur who specializes with pornography as well as some not-entirely-legal ties while Adam's conservative Catholic father Tom Roam a city district attorney is obsessed with bringing Goldman down in any way possible. The only thing both men have in common is a personal vow to halt the 'Romeo and Juliet-type' romantic union between their teenage children at all costs.
