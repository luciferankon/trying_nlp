Perceptive Faculty 2 is the second part of a trilogy attempting to create or portray an instrument which can influence perception of a situation through time scaling. the video image itself is divided into four windows. corresponding to the four dimensions the windows show an overhead side and frontal view and a temporal window (represented by an image in motion). Perceptive Faculty 2 is an upward progression from one level of perception to the next. simulated changes in the tape speed permit varying interpretations of a situation: the level of perception is altered when the speed is reduced doubled or tripled. when the maximum speed is reached the viewer enters a temporal level which opens up new spatial perceptions. in this state the various windows detach from the background to form a new independent space which has been liberated from customary dimensions. similar to photographic effects in which over- or underexposure is employed to create new impressions of perception the "time scale" is manipulated in this work so that the world is portrayed in new "temporal perspectives".
