The Santa Monica office of dating app Boink'r isn't your typical work environment. These hipster app gurus seem to know everything about relationships - except their own. The characters range from desperately co-dependent to nauseously narcissistic as they attempt to find meaningful connections of their own. It's what would happen if "Girls" integrated with "Workaholics." The series starts by following Summer Davis an event planner on her first day of work at Boink'r. Soon Summer finds herself in a love triangle planning a large-scale mixer for the app's users and possibly jobless when someone blackmails the company.
