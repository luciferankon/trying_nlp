Ben finally gets his big chance to impress his real-estate mogul father-in-law by acquiring a beautiful piece of land for a new riverfront condo development. The catch? The land is the home of the Renaissance Faire. All he has to do is return as 'Sir Benedict' and convince the owner a senile woman who believes she really is Queen Elizabeth to sell. But when Ben's old nemesis Sir Cuthbert Codswallow returns with his own plans to destroy it Ben realizes the "Code of a Knight" even applies to a modern-day dad. Even if that modern-day dad is wearing a pair of saggy medieval tights.
