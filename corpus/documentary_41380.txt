At first filmmaker Staffan Jul√©n wanted to make a traditional writer portrait on Nobel Prize laureate Svetlana Alexievich which she was not interested in. Her suggestion was instead that he would tag along with her in her ongoing projects and follow her when she talks to people about love. The preparatory work for one of a book includes thousands of interviews which Svetlana then compiles in literally formatted form. It is a slow and labor-intensive process. Like other visual artists she also have an assistant who helps her with the difficult task of transcribing the interviews word-by-word.
