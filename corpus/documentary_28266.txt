In the Shadow of the Crow is a timely documentary about the difficulties of preserving tribal traditions in contemporary America. The disturbing July 14th 2003 Smoke Shop incident that took place on Narragansett land which was broadcast on national news stations punctuates the heart of the film as the story of a longstanding dispute between the Narragansett Tribe and the state of Rhode Island unfolds and the true meaning and impact of tribal sovereignty is explored.
