A young man who is married and settled down in the city unknown to his rich relations whom he has never had the pleasure of meeting receives a letter from the latter stating that they are coming to the city to pay him a visit and also saying that they are bringing their daughter whom he must marry otherwise he must forfeit the fortune which they are about to give him. He is in a terrible quandary for if they know that he is already married they will cut him off entirely so he hits upon a scheme whereby he can retain their good will and gain the desired fortune in the end. He changes places with his servant and hides his dear wife in a room till the storm is passed. When the country folks arrive they are greeted by the man servant and are delighted to see him and immediately start to make the match with the young girl. The servant carries out the joke in good shape assuming the part of master of the house and compelling the real master to wait on him and the guests without a word of protest. They have the best in the house and the master sorely supplies them but he must keep up the hoax otherwise he is lost. Things reach such a state that the man of the house remonstrates but is soon put in his place by hard glances from all and when they sit down to dine he is compelled to wait on them without a murmur. Finally the old lady hears the wife screaming in the room and they start to investigate and when they find her she admits that she is a friend of the acting servant and is treated accordingly by all hands. Things reach such a pitch that the police are called in to quell the trouble and the man of the house tries to explain but has no voice in the affair and he becomes so infuriated that the officers are compelled to arrest him while the real servant passes off as the master and lets them take him away.
