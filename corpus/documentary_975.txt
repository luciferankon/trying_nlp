Barbara Cesare and Claudio have seen and heard them outside the body during traumatic events: due to cerebral malaria from the bite of a rattlesnake to be crushed by a ceiling that has collapsed. They remember having lived elsewhere for a period of time not measurable. What they saw and heard exactly? One thing is certain: they had a so-called near-death experience. Three witnesses like thousands of others that director Andrea Canetta collected between Switzerland Mozambique and the United States and shows us in his documentary "The Glance of The Soul". Their stories are interwoven with writings experiences and visions of famous people of our culture: the philosopher Plato visionary artist Hieronymus Bosch by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung to Elisabeth KÃ¼bler-Ross also her psychiatrist of Swiss origin who stands next to the dying is convinced that the existence of a life of the soul leaves the body and extends beyond the biological level. This belief leads her to spend time with Robert Monroe radio entrepreneur who had spontaneous out-of-body experience without having lived any traumatic event specifically. The Monroe Institute in Faber VA as he explains Andrea Canetta in "The Glance of The Soul" continues to teach the method used by its founder to be able to project his soul out-of-body state on a voluntary basis.
