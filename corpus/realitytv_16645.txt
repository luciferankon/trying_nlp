The South Asian Spelling Bee is a platform that gives all South Asian students the opportunity to test their skills within their core peer group. It is the effort of this unique national spelling bee to encourage and promote South Asian academic talent across the US and to bring this aspect of a South Asian student's life into the foreground by broadcasting the spelling contest as a series on Sony Entertainment Television (SET) Asia.
