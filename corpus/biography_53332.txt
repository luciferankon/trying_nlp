A girl with her lower limbs paralyzed meets a handsome boy Jung when she sits at the window reading. From then on when she hears bell ringing she knows it is Jung sending her books and they become bosom friends. Later she goes to the countryside with her parents. She teaches the village children to read and write under a big tree and learns acupuncture to treat villagers. In the spring the children carry her in a wooden wheelchair across rivers to treat patients and in the winter the children push her forward in the snowstorm to save the heavy patients. One day the girl falls ill and Jung comes to her bedside with unexpected news.
