Wild West Online is a buy to play open world PvP MMO developed and published by 612 Games. This video was recorded in the game's Closed Alpha Technical Test and shows some in-game shenanigans with the game's local voice chat. I had a lot of fun with this for sure. The core game as-is is definitely lacking in content but it is an alpha after all.
