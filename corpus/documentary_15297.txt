Based on the real life story of Ken Ken and Gold-D the documentary examines the cat landscape of Singapore. Ken Ken is an abused FIV+ cat while Gold-D who is also FIV+ was abandoned. They were both rescued by Mettacats and dogs shelter at different times. However their lives crossed path when they were both adopted months apart by Animal Human Alliance (AHA). Ken Ken and Gold-D went on to found their own brand of Gold-D cat food named after Gold-D. As cats are culled for being a nuisance the documentary looks at the cat situation in Taiwan and Italy to gain insights into how humans and cats (all animals for that matter) can co exist peacefully and beneficially.
