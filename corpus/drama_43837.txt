Robin lives in Glasgow in a room with a view of the park. This park becomes a no-go area during the night but even Robin doesn't get out of her house at all because she's too scared. She has everything delivered to her and doesn't open the door to anyone not for the delivery man not for her mother. But she has a task: she watches the park through her photo camera and takes photographs of everything she sees especially 'Rod' a man she gets obsessed with. One day she sees 'Rod' being kidnaped and she wants to save him but she will have to overcome her fear to do this.
