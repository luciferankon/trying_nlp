In the early hours of a cold winter night the police are called to a house on a quiet suburban street. There they find one of the most horrific crime scenes in the town's history - a family of five brutally massacred in an apparent home invasion. Just when the police have given up hope of finding any survivors they discover the family's 8 year old daughter Alice hiding inside a cupboard injured and terrified. After helping police with their investigation and healing from her wounds Alice is placed into a care home and adopted a year later by Michael and Jessica Mills a loving couple with three young boys. But shy Alice who spends most of the time crafting handmade dolls struggles to fit in with classmates at school and her new brothers resent her. Then a series of tragic accidents befall the school children. Soon the mysterious accidents spread to the family home beginning with the death of Michael and Jessica's eldest son. As the horrific incidents mount up Michael and Jessica start to suspect that Alice may not be as shy and innocent as she appears to be.
