When a member of the military sustains life-changing injuries and a medical retirement is forced upon us we have often wondered do I still have it? Do I still have what it takes to be a soldier regardless of the injuries I have sustained? This is where "Back to Basic" comes in. "Back to Basic" answers the same question that men and women have tried to answer years after their glory days have passed. Can I get back some part of my youth through sheer force of will? If any group of people can it's former members of the military. "Back to Basic" takes ten groups of three former military members with medical discharges for injuries sustained during combat and starts them at "Day Zero" of basic training and follows them all the way through as they are forced to reintegrate back into the military family. There are multiple ways to make it through this competition. If all three members of the group make it through together then the prize money is multiplied by three. If only two members make it through then it's only two times the prize money etc. During each assessment phase of basic training (There are three phases: Red White and Blue). If one member doesn't qualify during one of the multitudes of tests or phases and are recycled back to an earlier class. Then the whole group has a choice to make. Be recycled back with their partner or go forward without them. The former service members get the chance to keep the teams they were initially assigned trade team members or go at it alone. Only one group of former service members or individual can win. As in war there is no second place.
