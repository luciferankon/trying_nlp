An American airline firm plan to buy a new British passenger plane but the deal hits trouble when the plane's designer Jack Hopkins and Kathy Fisher the daughter of the Airline owner take an instant dislike to each other after crashing into each other in a quiet country lane. With each blaming the other for the accident the arrangement looks in trouble unless nature takes a hand. Delightful comedy showing a totally British way of doing things when hit by the American visitor to England. Wonderfully funny with superb shots of England in 1962.Charm is the central point from a bygone age. Watching time just fly's by with charm which explores a forgotten age.
