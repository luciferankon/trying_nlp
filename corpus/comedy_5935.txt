Created by Courtney Zito and based on her real life experiences in Los Angeles Hollywood Girl follows the comically blundering yet inspirationally uplifting life of celebrity hopeful and beautiful disaster Quinn Monroe. A self-proclaimed clich√© (aspiring actress by day and waitress by night) Quinn feels her dreams of silver screen stardom actualizing as a waking nightmare of never-ending obstacles and roadblocks. Broke tired confused and constantly tripping over her mark she's literally bruised at times self-deprecating but delightfully determined and never defeated. With life heart spirit and the carefree fun-loving support of her three best friends Quinn looks past the setbacks and black-and-blues to see her shining star on the walk of fame which to her isn't too far ahead. Or maybe it is. She is determined to conquer Hollywood but the road to stardom is full of missteps. "Two steps forward and ten steps back" like the show's original theme song says "She's there for life: She's a Hollywood Girl."
