It is said there is a pigeon for every person in New York City. That would be about 8400000 pigeons. Perhaps because of their large numbers--causing us to interact with them on a daily basis--or maybe because of the misinformation surrounding them pigeons are one of New York's most hated animals arguably as much as the common rat. However three people have decided to take it upon themselves to stand up and protect a flock of pigeons in Washington Square Park to inform people of the inherent value of a small creature that is usually the object of scorn and to stop pigeon nettings throughout the entire city which leads to a bizarre existential threat looming over every flock that ends with death in Pennsylvania. Three people have decided to become a voice for the birds.
