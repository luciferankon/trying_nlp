On April 1st 1986 Jean-Guy Lavigueur an unemployed blue-collar worker and his family won 7.6 million dollars. At the time it was the largest amount ever won at Loto-Quebec's 6/49 weekly draws. What should have been the beginning of a fairytale for the family turned rapidly into a nightmare... and their story is the stuff of amazing television drama.
