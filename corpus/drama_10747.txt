Three young men endure an impoverished existence in Southwest Sydney Australia. Van is a homeless young man living in a car park. When he encounters a free-spirited Carla he senses the opportunity for friendship and connection. Des is homeless as well but faces different issues: a pregnant girlfriend and trouble with a neighborhood gangster. Tommy is a junkie trying get his life on track and get a job after personal tragedy.
