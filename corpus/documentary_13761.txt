The film examines the background to the two global television broadcasts that were staged in the name of Nelson Mandela in 1988 (while he was still in prison on Robben Island) and 1990 (less than two months after his release) as well as the role they played in the struggle to end the Apartheid system and illustrates how they were possible only because they could build on the 40-year work of the international solidarity movement.
