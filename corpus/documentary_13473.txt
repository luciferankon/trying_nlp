Inspired by the discrimination suffered by his uncle Ram√≥n because of his sexual condition John Petrizzelli uses the screen to narrate the life of different people who have something in common: sexual-diversity. The stories feature from the anecdotal to the transcendental looking for the intimate world of old age without losing sight of the life of each character with different ways of looking at aging loneliness and death.
