A look at the advanced water safety techniques taught by the American Red Cross with comic interludes included of an ancient Roman who attempts to save a drowning man. The Red Cross techniques are demonstrated by a combination of underwater and surface footage and most demonstrate the defensive posture of the rescuer who must guard against the terrified victim pulling him or her under. Several of the vignettes include a male in trouble and a female rescuer. The narration except for the Roman interludes is straightforward. The Red Cross provides courses in both functional swimming to non-swimmers and water safety and rescue to experienced swimmers. Paddleboards can be a lifesaving tool both in quickly getting to distressed swimmers quickly as well as as a vessel on which to carry the distressed swimmer back to shore. Inexperienced swimmers who get caught in water too deep should stay calm face shore and bounce off the bottom if possible. Swimmers who experience muscle cramps in their legs while in the water should flex their foot and massage the muscle while still in the water. Those who unexpectedly find themselves in water while fully clothed should remove their clothing especially the shoes. If the distressed swimmer is reachable from shore it best to remain on shore to conduct the rescue. If one needs to swim out to reach the victim one should keep their head up to see where they're going and once at the victim keep his head up so that he can take in some air. The maneuvers differ to get the victim under control depending on the situation. This MGM short part of the Pete Smith Specialty Series gives examples of Red Cross water safety training and techniques. Describing water safety as a modern science the short then veers off into an ancient Roman setting with comedic overtones. The various life saving techniques care quite serious however and show what needs to be done in various life saving situations.
