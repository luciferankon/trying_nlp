Following his success with a new form of TV - 'The Family' (in which personal and wider social issues were raised within the confines of the daily life of a family) Paul Watson sought to extend how television could deal more broadly with such material. He came up with the idea of extended local production. To do this he created a production unit in the Lancashire town of Darwen - once a thriving industrial centre but at the time of the series had entered its years of decline - here he and the team lived and worked among groups of the town's citizens recording how local national and international events affected them and how they regarded the governance of the Town the County and the Country.
