Viktor Sundvall is a guard of a little channel in the Finnish countryside. He is an unsuccessful playwright who is frustrated with his marriage and his life and therefore he has became an alcoholic. One Saturday-morning in august he is waiting for a visit of an old family-friend Maija LÃ¤nsilehto with whom he has had a relationship in his youth. But Sundvall does not know that the Saturday will be the last day of his life.
