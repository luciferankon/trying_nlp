Patrick Glover's brother who is living in Australia has to leave home suddenly in connection with his work. Worried about leaving his two teenage daughters alone to fend for themselves during his absence he makes an urgent telephone call to Patrick in England to ask for his help. Patrick agrees to come to the rescue - and he and Nanny travel to Australia where they find Patrick's stunning brunette-haired nieces are very similar in nature to Patrick's own daughters - and that they even have the same breed of dog as their own 'H.G.' as a pet. The girls are not at first impressed with having their uncle staying in the house with them as they had been looking forward to the freedom of being left to their own devices without any adult supervision.
