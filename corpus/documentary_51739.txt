A team of scientists search for new species of insets and animals to a island just north of Australia. This is a place where no one has been to known as the lost land while on the there searches they enter a cave and witness a live volcanic eruption. A must see documentary! Disappointing that the BBC's intrepid explorers think it acceptable to disturb pristine caves never seen before by humankind and put in fixings for rope and cameras etc. Surely we should accept that future generations will scowl on this destruction and wait for better technology
