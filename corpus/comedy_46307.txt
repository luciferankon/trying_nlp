When the straight-laced mild-mannered Andrew (Andrew Rosas) is approached by his quick-witted slow-witted friend Matt (Matt Ryan) and asked to co-pilot an internet comedy series- Andrew finds himself at a crossroads. On the one hand Andrew can remain in his practical mediocre existence with his controlling and short girlfriend Whitney (Alicia Barone) or he can throw caution to the wind and embark on a journey through the very fabric of the human condition with Matt new love Audrey (Brooke Friesen) and their rag tag production team (some other people) as they attempt to make internet gold in hopes that it will net them fame and riches longer than this sentence could ever dream of being. But when it is uncovered that Matt may be using less than ethical means to fund the show it becomes a race against time to save the project the friendship and maybe (but not really) the universe itself.
