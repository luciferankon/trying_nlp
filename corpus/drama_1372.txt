Somewhere in rural Louisiana on the banks of Mississippi River four disparate characters end up living in a house together. Louise is a frustrated painter who inherited a house when her grandfather died a year ago. Pascale a geomorphologist from France came to study global warming but now cannot return home because of a newly acquired fear of flying. E.A. an old friend of Louise's grandfather came to visit and is left without a backup plan once he learns of his friend's passing. Luke also a painter takes Louise up on an offer to set up in her studio soon moving into her life as well. The story of these four unlikely housemates wanders between documentary and fantasy clarity and ambiguity and builds a sense of mood from the awkward moments and seamless flow of everyday life.
