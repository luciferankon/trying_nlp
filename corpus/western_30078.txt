While trying to discover who is rustling cattle from the ranch owned by his father Hair-Trigger Strong (Henry Roquemore) Bob Strong (Art Mix) meets and falls in love with Celia de la Costa (Fontaine LaRue) the daughter of Hair-Trigger's long-time enemy who was apparently killed by Strong. Bob goes in pursuit of Juan Escabar (Bud Osborne) whom he suspects is the rustler chief and finds himself out-numbered and in trouble. Celia warns the elder Strong who gets the Sheriff (Pete Crawford) and they ride to his rescue.
