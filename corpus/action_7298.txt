Choudhary Amar Singh is a farmer in rural India and lives a modest lifestyle with his wife Sharda and son Vikraanta. He excels in sugar cane production and is presented an award and a tractor by the State Government. He has named his farm after his son and expects him to continue farming. Amar's efforts are to remove the debts that he and other farmers have incurred from Zamindars. This does not auger well with Thakur Pratap Singh who arranges Amar's demise. This incident turns the lives of Vikraanta and Sharda upside down compelling Vikraanta to make a commitment to avenge his father's death - not knowing that he himself is placing his very life in jeopardy. Vikraanta is the only son of an honest village Mukhia Alok Nath. The Zamindars killed the Mukjia for being too honest. Vikraanta takes revenge and killed them. Vikraanta has shades of modern day Robin Hood. His love interest is also a victim of circumstances and finally 'TRUTH PREVAILS IN THE END'.
