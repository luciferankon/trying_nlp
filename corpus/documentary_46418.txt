The oldest and longest pilgrimage path in Japan. Over 1000km on foot. Young female Buddhist priest Maruko follows the path for the first time. Her goal: To seek experience and enable her to open her own Buddhist temple for people in need. The old path leads her through magnificent woods over mountains along modern day mega cities and ancient temples and provides a deep insight into the harmony of opposites that are so deeply woven into the Japanese culture.
