In a Haitian town Samuel's peaceful life is brutally shattered when the army kidnaps his journalist father. Forced to flee to the countryside the arrival of the army there sends him running again. He perilously flees to the United States in hopes of finding his mother whom he's been told is dead. From Miami to Montreal via New York his trail is littered by encounters with many living on North American society's fringe. To try and make sense of these experiences Samuel draws on the unconditional love he feels for the mother he's never known.
