FORCED CHANGE is a feature documentary taking an intimate look at four characters who were scattered around the country after the disastrous effects of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and never returned to their home of New Orleans. Over the next decade filmmaker Rennik Soholt photographed these journeys of displacement as they re-build their lives and grapple with the life-changing decisions that were forced upon them.
