So we have the kernel of the old story reworked a little and made a bit complex with the use of flashbacks. Raju (Siddharath himself) who was in Germany to do some research was not informed of his mother's demise and has a nervous breakdown when he gets the news. He takes a couple of years to recover and after that he marries his childhood sweetheart Ashwathy (Rima Kallingal) who is the family chauffeur's daughter. But his near and dear ones look at every action of his through the prism of his past illness which frustrates him. It does not help that he has a rather short temper. To add to the oddities he has converted his bedroom into a space research lab and dreams of building an organically self-sustainable world for himself and his wife in the middle of the family's rubber estate. But his elder brother Vishwan (Jishnu) has plans to build a resort catering to foreign clients. All this makes Raju very angry and violent and people begin to think that his illness has resurfaced.
