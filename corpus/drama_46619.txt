THE DREAMERS is a series for those of us who have been through that scary time post-graduation where you are trying to find your footing you are trying to find where you belong who is willing to listen to you and what you even have to say. It's about a group of six artists- a writer a singer a graphic designer an actress an actor and a photographer. They've all recently graduated from college from a conservatory from art school and are now making their way in the big wide world.
