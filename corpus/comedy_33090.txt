Two musicians brothers buy an old house where sometime ago the "rockers from hell" rehearsed. They were a legendary heavy metal band of the '80s who reportedly made a pact with the devil for success. Two girls joined to the band and began rehearsing for the new album. But the leader group steals some letters of the "rockers from hell" that he discover in a hidden place in the house. From here an evil force seems to wake up every time they start playing.
