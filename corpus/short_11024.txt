Pre-teen Tyrone lives in poverty. He's fascinated by a candy machine and asks his mother for money but she refuses. He tries other legal approaches which also fail. When the machine's serviceman is particularly rude to him he gets revenge by having his double-parked truck ticketed; the serviceman runs out and leaves his cart behind. Tyrone gets two men to lift the machine onto the cart and starts a trek through the city streets to the cemetery where the machine (stripped of its candy and money by street thugs) acts as a birthday present to his dead brother.
