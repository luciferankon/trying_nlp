She is maintaining she is able to fly drawing him into her half real world when miracles are worked. It turns out that Dorotea has the supernatural gift of divining and forecasting people thoughts and intentions.

Embarrassed as he is he leaves on a short trip and when finally resolved to come back to her it is too late. Why is it that Dorotea is found dead apparently having fallen after one of her flights?
