It takes the Earth 24 hours to rotate around its axis 7 rotations in a week and 365 spins to make a ski film. The making of a ski film is not a hobby for Rage Films but a way of life. Their talented group of athletes train year round works odd jobs and dream throughout the off season of what the upcoming season will bring. The filming season begins at the first sighting of snowflakes in November and comes to conclusion with the summer heat waves mid June.
