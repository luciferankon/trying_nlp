The story of Jairaj and Ratna two Bharat Natyam dancers past their prime is contrasted with that of their daughter Lata who is on the brink of establishing herself as a brilliant dancer. Her imminent success creates tension and jealousy and the audience is drawn into the dark secrets of family relationships and conflicts between generations. The play probes the surface of the characters to question their deeper motivations but the mode is comic rather than tragic even though the concerns are serious and you are never sure whether to laugh or cry.
