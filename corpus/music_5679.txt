This show never aired do to a legal battle between John Densmore and Ray Manzarak and Robbie Kreiger when they were performing as The Doors Of The 21st Century when this show was taped. The ruling was that the band was no longer able to perform under D21c and during the concert taping they announced the new name Riders On The Storm. This was the first episode in the Decades Rock Live Series. The show features Janes Addictions' Perry Farrell Macy Gray Vanilla Fudge John Sabastian Antigone Rising and Pat Travers and during the stormy night the power blew out each time Jim Morrison was paid homage...very weird indeed...When the producers submitted for sync licensing clearance John Densmore blocked the sync clearance and as a result the show never aired on TV..A Tribute To The Doors "Lost Episode" will find it's way to the airwaves eventually...this concert special will amaze everyone..
