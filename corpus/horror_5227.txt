Slaughter is the feature film debut of writer and director Juno Jakob and takes horror back to its nasty gritty and often tongue in cheek roots of the 1970's and 80's. The film follows escaped mental patient David Ward as he hides in his derelict caravan spending his days hiding from the police and doctors and filming himself raping and murdering while police slowly discover his crimes and get closer to him. The film is told from two view points. The traditional third person camera and David's own Hi8 camcorder.
