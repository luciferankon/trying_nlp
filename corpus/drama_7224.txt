A hot summer in the middle of the 50's. A pioneer's camp. 12 years old Dimana and Todor while being on a guard of honor at a giant monument of Stalin experience their first kiss. Literally Stalin's shadow shelters them but figuratively it separates them. They face their first moral disillusionment. 10 years later they meet in the same place. Todor is now a promising party functionary sent to crush a students' riot at a summer working brigade. Dimana has managed to preserve her beliefs and integrity. This time their love has no inhibitions. But following his assignment Todor succeeds in cheating the rebels and detaining them forcibly in the camp. The only one who refuses to obey is Dimana. The only path for her in a world like this is now to escape in search for freedom but she has to burn all bridges behind her in the process.
