Resiko is the term used by folks in Mauban a coastal town in the province of Quezon wherein a portion of one's salary earned by wine-makers is set aside for a treat. A family in Cagbalete Island ekes out their living through wine-making fishing and charcoal-making. Susan moonlights as a resort masseuse. Her second son Junior is into lapu-lapu fish-raising while her daughter Lota and husband Dudut are into wine-making. A daily fare resiko treat has become a threat to the family's fight for survival.
