For fifty years the young men and women of the Troopers Drum and Bugle Corps traveled the nation entertaining six Presidents and celebrities including John Wayne Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan. Not to mention audiences that range into the millions. They have won eleven National Championships and are a founding member of Drum Corps International. They are one of the most respected drum corps in the history of the activity. In 2006 severe financial problems paralyzed the organization forcing them to dissipate possibly forever... Or so we thought. After one full year of restructuring and immense support throughout the country the Troopers returned to the competitive field in 2007 with it's most successful season in over twenty years. This is the story of what Honor Loyalty and Dedication truly mean.
