With abortion as the central issue in this political melodrama from Albania viewers will react strongly for or against the heroine depending on their own convictions. After an accomplished concert pianist discovers she is pregnant with her second child she is dismayed and realizes that she will not be able to continue in her career and take care of a new baby as well. So she asks a committee of doctors for permission to have an abortion and is roundly taken to task for being a pampered intellectual. When asked if he would support an abortion her husband says he "does not want to become a criminal." In the end the concert pianist realizes that motherhood is after all more noble a calling than the concert stage.
