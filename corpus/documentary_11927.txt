An experimental community intended to address the ills of income disparity during the Gilded Age Fairhope Alabama was founded by mid-westerners in 1894 on the shores of Mobile Bay. It attracted artists eccentrics and reformers including Marietta Johnson who along with Maria Montessori was a pioneer of non-traditional education. The community's founding organization and the school are both still there. But as the town has evolved into a nationally known resort and retirement community it has struggled to reconcile its present with its past.
