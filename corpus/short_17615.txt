The script follows two parallel stories. One in Rome is the story of a young girl who has to deal with her pregnancy on her own and considers giving her child up for adoption. The other in India revolves around a young woman traveling to India for a job who as we find out was given up for adoption herself. Asha our protagonist in India meets with her guide to the country Aditi and more by chance than by design is brought a little closer to a part of her that she had always perceived as just a dark shadow in her life. As a part of Asha's job we have her interviewing Janani an older woman who once had to give one of her own children up for adoption. The objective is not to judge the decisions of any of our characters but to explore their feelings and their situations allowing the viewer to form his/her own opinion and leaving the question of how our characters will continue their path in life open to interpretation.
