With their monastery nestled in the jungle mountains of Myanmar life cycles peacefully for four young Buddhist monks. One day the abbot (Sayadaw) learns he must depart on a journey through the mountain pass - a journey that may never see his return. Alone and exposed the four young boys led by the courageous Ko Yin Witazara must now fend for themselves. Strange days filled with ghostly phenomena and jarring events shake the boys to the core dramatically influencing their understanding of this world and beyond as Witazara must choose whether to follow the master into the pass.
