Based on true events that happened in 1985 "Fixing Rhonda" tells the story of two childhood friends who run into each other after a long separation to find that they've grown in different directions. Rhonda has become a compulsive gambler while Lily is a "down on her luck" actress. Their history and past love for one another fuels their dysfunctional relationship. Lily puts everything else in her life on hold as she desperately tries to help Rhonda turn her life around and in the process risks losing Jonathan the man she is falling for. Rhonda continues to become more entangled in her gambling addiction and the debts she owes others as a result. Rhonda's addiction eventually ends with her own murder and Lily is left to pick up the pieces and fix her own life.
