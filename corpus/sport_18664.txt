When Indie film director Michael de Avila hooked his passion for story telling onto his love of bass fishing he spawned an award-winning reality television show Lunkerville. While other fishing shows rely on fast-paced pro-tournament competition host "Mike D" casts his line at everyday recreational bass fishermen traveling to their secret spots and sharing their special techniques. In his signature laid-back manner he reels in the camaraderie the banter and the bass. Now in its fifth season there's never a dull moment on Lunkerville the show that catches real people with real fish stories -- maybe even you! Lunkerville was voted "Favorite Fishing Show" three years in a row by viewers of The Sportsman Channel and recently was awarded a CINE Golden Eagle; one of the most prestigious awards in television.
