Death by noose. A nasty way to die if you're not dropped from a length but instead just had the support kicked from beneath you. A series of murders like this is taking place linked to a net-based game of 'Hangman' the words of which are linked somehow. Detective Roos (LDP) is on the case. He finds himself drawn to Grace Mitchell (Madchen Amick) who is somehow connected to all of the victims. Hangman is a story of pure vengeance against everyone who burdened the killer's mind.
