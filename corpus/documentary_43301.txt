Charles Chaplin became the greatest movie talent of his time after years of nurturing his film making artistry and his Tramp character. This film explores Chaplin's early film career where we see that growth period through his work in the Keystone and Essanay Studios from an awkward outsider to an accomplished cinematic artist. In addition the film also features the early result of that maturation with the fully reassembled version of his most ambitious film of that time _Police (1916)_ (qv).
