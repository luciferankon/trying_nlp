Mathiazhagan ( Nandaa) and Vasuki ( Ananya) are couples whose life is turned upside down in a single day when a stranger ( Nikesh Ram somewhat wooden) comes into their life. This guy tells them that he has their daughter and orders them to do the strangest of tasks if they want to see their daughter alive.
