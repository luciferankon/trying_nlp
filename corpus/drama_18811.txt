They Shoot Movies Don't They? is a voyeuristic look at first time director Tom Paulson and the movie he wrote called Mirage. Frank Gallagher is the documentarian whose camera waits and watches as Paulson navigates through a jungle of investors colleagues friends and family searching for money to finish his film. They Shoot Movies Don't They? offers a line-blurring examination of what one might give up in order to succeed.
