W.W. is a happy-go-lucky crook who makes his living robbing gas stations through the drive-up windows. The Dixie Dancekings are a country music band trying to get their first big break. W.W. crosses paths with the Dixie Dancekings when he hijacks their car (and them) to help him rob a bank. At first the band resists. However when they discover how much money they make they begin helping out voluntarily in order to finance their big break. At the same time W.W. takes a liking to them and uses his natural charm and smooth-talking ways to help them start down the road to stardom.
