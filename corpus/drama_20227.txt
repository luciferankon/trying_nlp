Merts and Selin live two lives one at daytime and one at night imprisoned in a monotonous everyday life where they each in their own way are observers of the world around them. Melts uses his days to photograph incidental passers-by while Selin is a withdrawn businesswoman. But slowly the outside world crowds in on them first when someone breaks into their apartment while they sleep and later when they decide to take the important step of entering the world daring to go on a car trip to the south.
