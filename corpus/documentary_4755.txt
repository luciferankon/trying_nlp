The film shows us the unknown face of TV world through a very popular show in Turkey called "Marriage with Esra Erol" aiming to marry people in front of the camera. It focuses on the people looking for a glimpse hope in the hallways of a huge TV studio: a popular presenter who feels at ease on stage but prays for good luck in the backstage; a director whispering in her earphone to guide her in order to make the show more exciting; a peculiar spectator whose job is to criticize; audience clapping when ordered; and a young man dancing to hip hop music without ever being in a disco all his life.
