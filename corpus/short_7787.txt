The unique story of Wyoming man Bob Taylor and the spirit and struggles of his life's journey. From teaching in the city to being a Cowboy in Wyoming to raising his family without electricity in the cabin he built by hand and of course baseball. Above all this film is about life and holding on to those memories that make us who we are. Good or bad everyone has their own Summer of '81.
