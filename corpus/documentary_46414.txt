A documentary about Margaret Cho's homeless outreach campaign inspired by the philanthropy of Robin Williams. After the death of her friend Robin Williams Margaret Cho took to the streets of San Francisco with the mantra "Don't grieve Robin BE Robin." What started as Margaret busking on the corner with a bag of socks and a guitar case rapidly turned into hundreds of musicians comedians and homeless advocates spreading food clothes money and awareness in an amazing humanitarian street theater experience. The film that captured these events is not only entertaining but deeply moving and above all else inspiring.
