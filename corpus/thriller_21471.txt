After receiving an invitation online Jessie Kailanni and Xander head off on a road trip to the biggest social media party of the year; "Our Social Playground". Sex Drugs and Alcohol fuel the bikini-clad babes and muscled up guys as they gather together striving to achieve their socialite status but Jessie isn't convinced as she struggles with the faux reality of social media. Xander introduces Jessie to Bodhi an old childhood friend that shares her views on social media but as a sadistic serial killer starts executing people at the party; they soon realise they share a lot more than just their views. Jessie is captured and taken to an abandoned cabin where she is forced to confront her troubled past and she learns that not all debts are paid with money; some are paid in blood.
