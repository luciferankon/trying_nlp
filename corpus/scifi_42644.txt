THE STAIRWELL is an absurd Orwellian study of the modern corporate caste system which follows the confusion created in the lives of a business when their computer mainframe seizes. Further chaos ensues when the elevator ceases to function and news is learned about the death of Richard's (the CEO) wife. As everything turns topsy-turvy a lowly office assistant Brian must overcome the laws set upon him by society and force himself to rise to his full potential and save this corporation before it pummels to its inevitable demise.
