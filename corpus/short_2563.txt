Satellites must like all of us eventually come down to earth - the question is where and when. A visual interpretation of a poem by Rick Webster this short but evocative film (with music by Julian Forsyth) takes viewers on an unusual orbit around the earth - with a satellite's eye view of a voyage of "decay" that could end anywhere - perhaps with a spiral into an ocean or a plummet into the vast Russian forest: "a flame and a wisp of smoke that will be all I leave behind."
