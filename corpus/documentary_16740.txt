In the 19th century Henry Smith took the first 3D pictures of the French capital and its inhabitants documenting life as it was then. A countless number of these pictures were kept in archives to be forgotten by all. After their restoration these treasures of the past have become part of a film that shows the evolution of the city using the original 3D pictures and 3D images of contemporary Paris. The fictional narrator is the descendant of Henry Smith who discovers her ancestor's legacy as the past and the evolution of the city unfolds before our eyes.
