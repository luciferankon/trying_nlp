Charlie Grant was a Canadian in Germany who became a successful diamond merchant with the help of a elderly jewish couple who are his patrons. When the Nazi's come to power Charlie cannot ignore the fact his Jewish friend's lives are becoming more intolerable. Despite the growing danger Charlie vows to help as many Jews as possible escape the country using his merchandise for the necessary bribes and connections. However he gets no help from the Canadian Government which took a bigoted "none is too many" attitude to Jewish immigration.
