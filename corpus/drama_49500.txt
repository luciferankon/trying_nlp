Surrounded by the sea and the mountains Mantas Village was about to hold a summer festival. In the village there was a welfare institute for the handicapped called Mencken where everyone practiced their drums and dancing in anticipation of the festival. As the day of the festival was approaching something happened. The sky in which the clouds were drifting slowly has turned dark and suddenly the air becomes disquieting from the bracing wind of the sea.
