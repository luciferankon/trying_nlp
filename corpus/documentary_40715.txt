This is a documentary covering Queen Elizabeth's World Tour (just as the title indicates) or at least the portion through the Fiji Islands the Friendly Islands and New Zealand. The Queen attends some festivals in her honor in Fiji and in the Friendly Islands where she is entertained by Queen Salotte---oops add another queen to the cast---and in New Zealand where she attends some Maori rituals.
