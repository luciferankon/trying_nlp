Terranean tells the story of Trevor Belmont (Tom Slater) a highly respected member of a secret society of young people called Terraneans. Having turned eighteen the time has come for Trevor to leave the group. But during his final confrontation with the Resistors - a breakaway faction bent on thwarting the Terraneans - something goes terribly wrong. Unjustly scapegoated for a deadly mistake Trevor finds himself on the run. Pitted against him are ruthless thugs called Contractors under the employ of his rival and former friend David (Sam Morehouse). Along the way Trevor allies with Claire (Justine Reanne) a rouge Contractor and Clint (Jason Lewis) an old friend and jaded ex-Terranean. Trevor must not only come to terms with David's betrayal he must confront his own spotted history as well. And he has to do it all while caught in the crossfire of a conspiracy at the highest level.
