A heroin-addicted couple struggling with a work habit. Leslie early 40's has an optimistic outlook and friendly demeanor-- for a man ravaged by drugs. He holds a steady job making baby seats for Prius and is admired by his younger co-workers for what they think is a "righteous commitment to the drink". June late 30's pale haggard has a relatively important job as an aquatic chemist. She looks like all of the other unkempt scientists at the lab so her appearance is a non-issue. She loves Leslie but can never remember what he does for a living or that they are married. They live in the trailer parked in front of their beautiful home which is permanently under construction.
