Green Advocate Peter Ormond is an average guy who has made lifestyle choices to reject consumer culture and reduce his carbon footprint. Peter is an every day hero because the choices he makes though often small collectively make a huge impact on the environment. Peter's neighbor Peter Potential is a composite character who reflects a large segment of the population - those who need to become self-aware of the negative impact their choices are having on the planet. "A Tale of Two Peters" is a light-hearted look at the way we consume resources offering up some solutions along the way.
