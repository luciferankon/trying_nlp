The series follows the dating adventures and misadventures of three L.A. girls who prove that just because a girl is hot it doesn't necessarily follow that she has a man or even that she'd know what to do with one if she got one. Jessica the Star Trek/comic book geeky girl seems to always say and do just the wrong thing at the wrong time to the wrong guy proving that well "Nerdy girls need love too." Her friends' awkward attempts to help her generally backfire and though their luck with men is a little better than hers it's still not enough to keep from being face-aching funny.
