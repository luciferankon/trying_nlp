Two dockersboth deaf and dumb live in London 's East end in the fifties .Together they stand by each other and their camaraderie helps them to carry on their sad life on a wharf where cranes are more important than human beings and in a boarding-house where their landlady feeds them without any compassion .Besides all the brats on the block laugh at themcall them names .They try to make the best of ithaving a drink in a pubor going to the fair.
