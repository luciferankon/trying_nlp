Who are the two prophets in Revelation 11? The two messengers who lie dead in the great city? The two prophets have generally been shrouded in mystery . . . until now. The result of 8+ years of research Unlocking the Mystery of the Two Prophets: Revelation 11 is part 1 in a series exploring connections between the two prophets in Revelation 11 and two of the greatest prophets to ever live on this earth. Did Joseph and Hyrum Smith perform a specific ministry within the period of three and one half years that triggered the fulfillment of thousands of years of ancient Biblical prophecy? Why was Joseph Smith crowned King of Israel in Nauvoo? Why did John reference the ark in Heaven when describing the mission of the Two Prophets? Did you know that there are two joint heads for this last and final dispensation? How were Joseph and Hyrum Smith "clothed in sackcloth" in Nauvoo? Is the ark of the covenant a similitude or foreshadowing of the Latter-days?
