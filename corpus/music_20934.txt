In the'60s a new sound came across the Atlantic from England a musical invasion unlike anything America had ever experienced. In February 1964 The Beatles landed on Ed Sullivan's stage and our world changed forever. The so-called "British Invasion" took America by storm and bands such as The Rolling Stones The Hollies Herman's Hermits and The Animals were crawling all over the record charts. They were cutting edge and far different from what we'd come to expect from rock 'n roll in the States. They had long hair dressed in narrow lapel suits and looked scruffy but they had a unique charm. Their beat- a newly reinvigorated brand of rock 'n roll was coming back to America and kids couldn't get enough of it.
