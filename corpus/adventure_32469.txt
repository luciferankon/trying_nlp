One dark and stormy evening the civic-minded Professor Stinkbaum was working in his lab where he was secretly building a machine that would save the world from pollution by transporting it to a place he called Dimension X-Crement. That same evening eccentric millionaire Snotty Ragsdale paid a visit to the lab to investigate this project and find out how such a thing was possible. He was not too sure about the machine's purpose. After activating the machine Ragsdale inhaled a cloud of pepper through his nose causing him to let out a mighty sneeze. The power of the sneeze broke the machine opening a portal. Just then a mysterious giant arm popped out of the portal and stole the machine's main power source. In response to this danger Snotty rushed into the men's room to change into his alter ego the mighty Boogerman and jumped into the portal to pursue the arm to learn the reason for the theft it had committed.
