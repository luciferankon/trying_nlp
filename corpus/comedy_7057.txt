Fail tells a story of an inexperienced but extremely passionate film director who makes her first micro budget feature film. The struggle is real: most of the cast members are flaky and unstable the boom operator is an unreliable pothead and the director of photography always feels unappreciated. A fling between the lead actress and the lead actor escalates the tension on set. The supporting actress comes out of the closet making everything worse. When one of the cast members quits unexpectedly and the producers run out of money the film never gets finished.
