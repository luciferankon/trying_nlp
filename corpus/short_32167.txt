This is a tale made by the people of Kurokawa hot-spring village deep in rural Mt. Aso Japan. We decided to depict the most fascinating 'person' in Kurokawa using the legends and folklore of Japan and Kurokawa that had passed down from ancient times as a base. The Japanese cast is comprised entirely of people actually living in Aso. We would be delighted to share Kurokawa's outlook and Japan with the people of the world.
