This is a personal documentary about the influence of Rumble Fish the 1983 film directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is also about Tulsa Oklahoma (where Coppola's movie was shot) and about how that movie was a milestone on Alberto Fuguet's creative work as a writer and filmmaker but also on several film-related people from Chile Argentina and Uruguay.
