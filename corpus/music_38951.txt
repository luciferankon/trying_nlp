Summer replacement comedy/variety show hosted by the eponymous Washington D.C.-based folk-rock group (Bill and Taffy Danoff Jon Carroll and Margot Chapman) one-hit wonders ("Afternoon Delight" a number-one hit the previous year) who'd started out as John Denver's backup group. The comedy was provided primarily by veteran D.C.-based satirist Mark Russell and David Letterman who got his first national exposure with this program.
