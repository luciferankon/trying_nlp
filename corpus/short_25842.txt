This is a look at the very beginning phase of the production of 'Tron.' It features some early concept art test footage and a television short entitled "Computers are People Too." It consists of interviews with writer/director Steven Lisberger and producer Donald Kushner. Lisberger discusses his inspirations and his insistence on the use of computer animation while Kushner tells us how they ended up working with Disney. Also it provides a snippet from a May 1982 TV program of that name. The piece looked at that era's top-of-the-line computer work and we hear from Lisberger and co-supervisor of special effects Richard Taylor in this Tron-centered segment.
