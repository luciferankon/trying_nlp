In the very oldfashioned town of Ostend suddenly 13 suitcases are delivered to the hotel with a note that O.F. will be here soon and needs 6 rooms (the hotel just has five). This event probably the biggest in 300 years starts a small wave of modernisation yet everybody is wondering who O.F. is. Journalist Stix and architect Stark have an idea how to use this event. They proclaim that O.F. is a former citizen of the town who became a millionaire abroad. They tell their fellow citizens that the town still needs modernisation like better hotels nightclubs shops etc. And soon Ostend is a boomtown then a capital. The architect responsible for the new buildings is finaly allowed to marry the mayor's daughter while Stix marries the cabaret star and the widowed mayor his new secretary. The only problem is O.F. hasn't shown up while finance experts from all over the world are trying to solve the depression problem that is non-existant in Ostend this soon lets the people forget about O.F.
