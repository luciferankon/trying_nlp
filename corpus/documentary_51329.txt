Lost. Above all lost. In a land that is no longer theirs running away from violence and confusion they arrive in a small country with no room for them a country they had heard about but never known: Portugal. Twenty years after the end of the colonization they have a new life in other countries and speak about their memories and the love for the African lands they dream to go back to. Exceptional archives footage. They were called "Os Retornados" (The ones that came back).
