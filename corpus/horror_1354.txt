Survivors of a feral flesh-eating clan are chowing their way through the locals. Amy Halbard and Claire Carey strive to survive their abduction by the cannibals and save their children. A subplot involving Claire's despicable husband Steven gives an opportunity to cleverly compare predatory civilized folk to the appetite-driven primitives. On February 27th 1858 in Bangor's Dead River the family of Daniel Cook keeper of the Barnet Lighthouse vanished mysteriously. Later on in 1902 a great-granddaughter went missing too in the same area where several incidents of grisly murders and child abductions were reported ever since. Who could be the culprit? Nowadays the Halbards and their baby girl are living peacefully in the region unbeknownst to them that Cook's descendants and their clan of cannibalistic inbred savages who keep moving in the mainland have alarmingly approached their house. As the local Police with the aid of seasoned ex-cop George Chandler comb the lush woods to find the flesh-eaters' cave the clan while still on the loose craving the innocent Halbard baby for its powers will hunt down each and every one of them until there is no one left in the way. Is the Halbards' will to survive strong enough against the feral primitives' brutal acts of carnage?
