Our Journey Home follows three families and examines how their relationship to home has shaped them. Growing up in public housing Byron Ellis felt judgment from others about the place he called home. He knew people thought he would never amount to anything coming from behind the tall gates of the projects where his family lived. But the doubters lit a fire under him. Stephanie Graham's safety and stability crumbled at the hands of an abusive ex husband. She moved home with her handicapped dad who was later killed in a hit and run. That was the beginning of the avalanche. She ended up in a Skid Row shelter with her children. Stephanie's story shows us that homelessness can happen to anyone. When Rosalio Galaviz was a baby his family immigrated to the US from Mexico for a new life. But shortly after arriving a tragic incident sent his father to prison and left his mother alone to care for five children. Her minimum wage jobs could barely make ends meet. Public housing saved his family from living on the streets and afforded all of them the stability to thrive. Our Journey Home challenges our perceptions about people in need of supportive housing. The film examines the role we all play in supporting those who struggle in having a stable place from where they can grow and dream. A place to call their own.
