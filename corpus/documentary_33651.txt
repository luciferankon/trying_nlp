Months after Hosni Mubarak stepped down Egyptians country-wide seem determined to maintain the insurgency until their demands are met. It is therefore too premature to expect filmmakers to imagine fictions that convey the unimaginable experience of the uprising. A different predicament hangs over documentary cinema and Tahrir 2011 is a laudable attempt to steer away from reportage and reflect on what historians will index as the first chapter of the uprising. Structured in three chapters the film playfully debunks misconceptions and stereotypes.
