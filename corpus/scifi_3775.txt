Set in a remote part of the Himalayas Sonchidi is about two travelers who are in search of a flying-craft which one of them thinks is made by a mad engineer whom he recollects from his childhood. They believe that if they can find the craft it could possibly take them to the ultimate escape from the cycle of births. On their way to find this machine they record their memories dreams and fears in a sound-recorder and a notebook.
