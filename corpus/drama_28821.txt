The files of Rear Admiral Ellis M. Zacharias were the basis of this series based on American counterespionage from 25 years in naval intelligence. The stories were connected with the Cold War which required frequent updates supplied by Admiral Zacharias who served as technical consultant for the series. Bruce Gordon played Commander Matson who hosted the program and was occasionally featured in several episodes.
