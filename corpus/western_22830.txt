The Camp and Larkin families are neighboring ranchers and young Rod Camp ('Bob Steele (I)' (qv) is in love with Joe Larkin's ('William Farnum' (qv))daughter Margie ('Lucile Browne' (qv).) But from out of nowhere Joe's outlaw brother Bill Larkins ('George 'Gabby' Hayes' (qv)) and his two worthless sons Holt ('James Flavin' (qv)) and "Slim" ('Archie Ricks' (qv) and move in with the peaceful and law-abiding branch of the family. In addition to rustling cattle from the neighboring ranchers Hold and "Slim" decide they have kissing-rights to cousin Margie and this leads to Rod having a fight with them at a barn-dance. When his father ('Charles K. French (I)' (qv) catches the renegade Larkins rustling and changing brands on his cattle he is shot. Rod sets out to prove they are the culprits.
