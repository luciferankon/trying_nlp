Survival Strategies for the New Millennium critically engages with the future development of world history. Based in the present we are looking out until the year 2040. The ongoing presence of apocalyptic prophecies and fear-mongering statistics in the media is taking up ever more space in both politics and the public sphere. The film covers these controversial issues in the form of a classical documentary on the one hand and an exceptional sensitively staged drama on the other hand. We make the acquaintance of Monika who actively engages with and participates in the world's historical developments. Through her observations on world affairs we are gaining insight into the "world of tomorrow". She is an independent photo journalist working on her book "2040 - The End of Humanity". Inspired by her profound knowledge of the far-reaching connections in the "engine of the world" she dares to address the delicate idea of a new world order. The documentary part of the film is based on captivating interviews with experts in the area of globalization and peace politics. These talks provide an overview of the interrelations between our political past and the direct future.
