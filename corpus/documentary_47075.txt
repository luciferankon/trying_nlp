An exploration of the life of the University of Chicago community. Among the subjects are classroom situations (with taped interviews juxtaposed to provide commentary) group activities student and faculty discussions a folk festival the "Wash Prom" a demonstration by the Congress of Racial Equality a "twist night" alumni reminiscences and a Humanities Committee tea. Newsreel footage of the old intercollegiate football team and years later of scientists working on the clandestine Manhattan Project at Stagg Field contrast with views of Stagg Field as it is today.
