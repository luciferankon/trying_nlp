The 'One Day In VeNICE' project is a video collaboration designed to explore our diversity and celebrate our similarities and differences as a community. Most of us would agree the community we live in plays a vital part in how we perceive the world and interact with it. With this film we hope to see how the modern day community can give us the tools we need to better understand the world around us as we move forward.
