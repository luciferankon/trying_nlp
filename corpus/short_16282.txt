In one of those suburbs where everything is made to look safe the silhouette of a woman wanders around clicking her heels. A young man is about to experience a strange night half way between fantasy and reality. Two sexual intercourses firstly with oneself and then with someone else another one... possibly an alter ego his alter ego conjured up to put an end to loneliness... Caught between his own double and an evanescent woman he is confronted with two opposite ways out of his isolation. This duality will push him in a deceptive triangular love affair which becomes impossible with this unbalanced equation as the third person is relentlessly missing.
