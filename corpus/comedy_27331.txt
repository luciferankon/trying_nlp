In a Swiss Alpine resort shortly after the War an army officer and upper-class Humpy Miller both set their sights on Mary the landlord's daughter. When the two come down with chicken pox they are put in the charge of fellow guest Miss Cartwright who turns out to be Humpy's old nanny. The two Englishmen unite not only against her tyranny but against a dense Greek who is also after Mary.
