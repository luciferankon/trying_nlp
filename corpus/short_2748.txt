This experimental 4 screen juxtaposition of simple life moments (non-human) that combined create an attentiveness to the very simple. Unlike Life Collage #1 where humans are explored in Life Collage #2 explores other life forms. Both Life Collages are silent creating a type of self-consciousness that has an audience member even more attuned to the life moments being shown.
