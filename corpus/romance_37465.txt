A British writer finds love down two different and equally surprising avenues while on a fact-finding trip to Spain. Both are life changing; one emotionally and the other without question physically but the lines couldn't be more blurred. A series of serendipitous events and one's very own mortal curiosity lead man to discover beast in the most lucid sense in la plaza de toros but his true fight is with romance passion and his own conscience. Oh and a girl called Cynthia.
