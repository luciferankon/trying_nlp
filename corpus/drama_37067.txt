A depiction of the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth on the day of his crucifixion in Jerusalem. The story opens in the Garden of Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot the controversial Jesus--who has performed 'miracles' and has publicly announced that he is 'the Son of God'--is arrested and taken back within the city walls of Jerusalem. There the leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy; subsequently his trial results with the leaders condemning him to his death. Jesus is brought before Pontius Pilate the prefect of the Roman province of Judaea for his sentencing. Pilate listens to the accusations leveled at Jesus by the Pharisees. Realizing that his own decision will cause him to become embroiled in a political conflict Pilate defers to King Herod in deciding the matter of how to persecute Jesus. However Herod returns Jesus to Pilate who in turn gives the crowd a choice between which prisoner they would rather to see set free--Jesus or Barrabas. The crowd chooses to have Barrabas set free. Thus Jesus is handed over to the Roman soldiers and is brutally flagellated. Bloody and unrecognizable he is brought back before Pilate who once again presents him to the thirsty crowd--assuming they will see that Jesus has been punished enough. The crowd however is not satisfied. Thus Pilate washes his hands of the entire dilemma ordering his men to do as the crowd wishes. Whipped and weakened Jesus is presented with the cross and is ordered to carry it through the streets of Jerusalem all the way up to Golgotha. There more corporal cruelty takes place as Jesus is nailed to the cross--suffering he hangs there left to die. Initially in his dazed suffering Jesus is alarmed that he has been abandoned by God his father. He then beseeches God. At the moment of his death nature itself over-turns. The Passion of The Christ focusses on the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life. The film begins in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus has gone to pray after sitting the Last Supper. Jesus must resist the temptations of Satan. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot Jesus is then arrested and taken within the city walls of Jerusalem where leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his trial results in a condemnation to death. This film depicts the final hours of Jesus Christ starting from His prayers in the Garden of Gethsemane and His betrayal at the hands of Judas Iscariot. It goes on to show the trials He endured under Pontius Pilate and King Herod as well as the torture and ridicule He suffered in between. Once the death sentence is pronounced He carries a heavy wooden cross to Golgotha amidst throngs of jeering citizens and horrendous beatings while a few citizens do what they can to help Him. Throughout this time we are shown memories from His past with His mother and Disciples where He gives His teachings. Finally He is crucified dies and is buried but resurrects from the dead on the third day.
