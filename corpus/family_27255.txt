Imagine a group of very young Top Gear presenters in a Sesame Street/Panto style with strong British accents and lots of rock and roll! The show is designed to show people lots of free and low-cost adventures and activities for children. It also encourages viewers to get involved in a local Brilliant Book Club meet-up at a local library art and crafts store or bookshop. The show has an interactive website to encourage viewers to share their Brilliant artwork/photos and other stuff.
