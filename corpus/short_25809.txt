The mystery of a burnt-out car abandoned off Long Street in the heart of Cape Town's CBD sparked the imagination and commentary of passers by. In this short film we encounter as we do in everyday life: members of secret societies ex-cons betrayed girlfriends and recreational forensic experts. Through the tapestry of their narratives and theories a social portrait of colloquial rationale evolves at times both comical and surprising in content. Yudelman returned to the car periodically always expecting to find it gone - but thanks to the inefficiency of local authorities was able to continue filming over a period of three weeks. On each visit he met up with characters willing to mediate the spaces between fact and fiction - thereby offering the structure for this film with anecdotes ranging from plausible to the down-right absurd. In this piece Yudelman examines the ambivalent nature of personal truth and shared reality by scrutinizing the paradoxes and ironies of daily life.
