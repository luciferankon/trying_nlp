Hans Von Bulow stated "He who cannot read between the lines who does not possess a certain quantum of ingenuity who brings with him no fantasy himself remains a respectable distance from Bach's 'Chromatic Fantasy'." World-class violist Rozanna enters an empty stage and plays the 'Chromatic Fantasy.' She grows more and more intimate with the music her environment slowly leaves her as she slips deep into her mind. In her fantasy Rozanna clutching her silent white viola pursues her musical Red self from a courtyard and to a garden. Finally in the forest Rozanna in White finds her Red self and approaches to the final passionate measures. White creeps closer and closer to her Red self and summoning up the courage plays the final conclusive note.
