Although better known for its chocolate tight-lipped banks and picturesque Alps Switzerland is also home to some of the oldest and strangest Carnival traditions in the world. When the late winter Carnival spirit erupts in the cities and remote mountain villages the normally reserved Swiss don their masks and re-encounter each other in surprisingly earthy ways. In this film participants of all ages reflect on the importance of Carnival to themselves and their communities as well as on its future.
