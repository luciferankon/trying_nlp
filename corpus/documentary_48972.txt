Doris DÃ¶rrie's camera greets Edward Espe Brown when he arrives in Australia to give a class on cooking Zen and meditation. We see him back home in Northern California as well. Brown for forty years a Zen cook demonstrates cooking as well as commenting on topics including anger quiet gleaning and waste battered pots and how he found his vocation. A focus of his is to demonstrate how to bring one's self to cooking and to others simultaneously. He quotes often from two masters with several examples of Zen wit. The camera takes the occasional trip to fast food restaurants to provide contrast to Brown's approach and results.
