The Danes are in the middle of an election campaign where they are facing a very difficult choice. Which animal is to be elected the national Danish mammal? They can choose between the fox the fallow deer the squirrel the common dormouse and the pig. The main character of the movie Jens Bonde is not particularly interested in the election but one thing is for sure. He does not like the pig despite he is the son of a pig farmer. In general he disowns everything that has to do with pigs - just the mere thought of meat balls makes him ill in bed. Jens' wife Gitte is very concerned about her husband and his inexplicable symptoms that get worse day by day. When she finds out that Jens only can be cured by getting in contact with the animal he disowns - namely the pig - she decides to take action and do something about the matter. Soon after wards Jens is a member of the Danish Pig Association who fights for the election of the pig as the national Danish mammal. The Huma-Porcellone Syndrome is a satirical short film concerning the Danes' relationship to the many millions of pigs living and dying in Denmark.
