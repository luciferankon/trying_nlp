An ancient European Legend comes alive with the story of La Befana-a mythical character who rewards the good children...and punishes the bad. The children of the village dismiss the legend as an old wives tale but as the slaughters continue their doubts begin to wane. Are the murders the work of a local resident hiding behind the story of La Befana or does the fable really exist?
