Tarantula is an animated half hour comedy written by Carson Mell (Silicon Valley Eastbound and Down) and executive produced by Danny McBride and Rough House Pictures. Set at the Tierra Chula Resident Hotel aka the Tarantula it centers on Echo Johnson a respected but uncertified tattoo artist who delivers absurd yet introspective monologues. Echo's poetic ramblings tell tales of misadventures with the other residents including Lucas the sci-fi writer and bread truck driver Booty the sensitive lead singer and Bess a lady whose toughness was forged in the local honky-tonks as they partake in party crashing dumpster diving and other socially dubious acts of mischief.
