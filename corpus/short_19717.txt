Since 1994 when Klaus Koch discovered the soft silent and clean energy of the "Sterling" engine he built above all machines that work with nothing more than hot air. Portrait of Klaus Koch shot against his will. Sometimes- Klaus Koch likes to provoke and let you see the dangerous side of technology.So he exaggerates bringing up the situation to an extreme. It is satire and it is not necessary to take it too serious. He does not criticize technology only the way of using it leading it to absurdity. The art of Klaus Koch is to have fun besides he his able to laugh about himself. He transforms garbage into something unexpected that surprises and stimulates with a type of vicious satiric and sometimes kind sense of humour. He amuses himself working without being focused in the result or the advantage of his machines. It is the game who finds his sense in itself. For the construction of his machines he uses the silent and clean energy of the "Sterling motor" which functions with nothing more than hot air. In recent years the advantages of Sterling engines have become significant which underlines also the actuality of the work of Klaus Koch.
