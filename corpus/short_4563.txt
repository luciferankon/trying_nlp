It's late in the evening. Felix drives his old Citroen DS. He breaks down. He pushes his vehicle to a very sordid garage. Very tired he supplies the night watchman to give him "two or three liters of gasoline". Music is coming from a feast done in the rosa home just on the other side of the street. Jacky and Elsa are getting married. Elsa and Felix see each others. They are going to spend the night together. Elsa is a wild girl. Felix should never break down this night.
