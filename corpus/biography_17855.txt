My Strange Little Art Film uniquely combines art photography and film to create a cute funny and sweetly authentic movie. Exploring his artistic side filmmaker Michael Benatar creates a pollack-esque abstract painting using two female friends as targets. In the process Kristen Baranano and Kirby Farah are transformed into pieces of art themselves and use a handheld camera and expressive commentary to document the experience from a a rarely seen perspective. Dynamic camera angels and the characters' interactions keep the viewer fully engaged in the subtle but charming story and friendship art and what happens when you fling paint at your friends.
