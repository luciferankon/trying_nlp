The bodies of over 900000 World War One soldiers were never found or identified. In an astonishing discovery 250 of these men were recently unearthed in six unmarked mass graves in Fromelles a tiny village in Northern France. DSP has been granted exclusive access by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to document the exhumation of these soldiers' remains and their subsequent burial in the new Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery - the first to be built for 50 years. This documentary shows the search to reveal the identities of the soldiers; using historical records and modern DNA science the Commonwealth War Graves team will attempt to give names to the dead and offer their surviving relatives the chance to learn what happened to them.
