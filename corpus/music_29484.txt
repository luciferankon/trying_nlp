In July 2007 Daniel Johnston made a highly acclaimed appearance at London's Union Chapel described by the Evening Standard as "...nothing short of breathtaking". Adjustable Productions now present the greatly anticipated film of this concert: 'The Angel and Daniel Johnston - Live at the Union Chapel'. Supported by a selection of friends including the notable talents of James Yorkston and Adem early collaborator Brett Hartenbach and a specially assembled group of underground British musicians Daniel delivers definitive renditions of favorites from the breadth of his career such as 'True Love Will Find You in the End' 'Walking the Cow' and 'Some Things Last a Long Time'. New songs such as 'Mean Girls...' and 'Try to Love' are introduced and a fresh shine is brought to some hitherto overlooked gems such as "Go" and "Living Life".
