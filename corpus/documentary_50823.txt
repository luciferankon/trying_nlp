This NZBC religious programme goes where TV cameras had never gone before: behind the walls of the Carmelite monastery in Christchurch. There it finds a community of 16 Catholic nuns members of a 400-year-old order who have shut themselves off from the outside world to lead lives devoted to prayer contemplation and simple manual work. Despite their seclusion the sisters are unphased by the intrusion and happy to discuss their lives and their beliefs; while the simplicity and ceremony of their world provides fertile ground for the monochrome camerawork.
