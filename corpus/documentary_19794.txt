MY PLAYGROUND explores the way Parkour and Freerunning is changing the perception of urban space and how the spaces and buildings they are moving on are changing them. Mainly set in Copenhagen the film follows Team JiYo as they explore the city and encounter the obstacles it presents. Award winning architect Bjarke Ingels founder of BIG Architects is fascinated by the way Team JiYo convey architecture and takes the team to his buildings to explore and unfold their skills that may be just as groundbreaking as the architecture itself. The film travels around the world from Denmark to Japan United States United Kingdom and China to explore where the urban mobility is heading. Team JiYo has a dream of making the biggest dedicated parkour park in the world but isn't parkour and freerunning supposed to be in the city and not in a fixed environment? Kaspar Astrup Schr√∂der set out to more closely examine the way that traceurs interact with architecture - honing in on parkour and urban mobilty in modern cities spaces via Team JiYo and the people that determine how the space is shaped within our cities.
