See what happens to a misplaced genius when he stumbles into a career as a very special very discreet detective to a vulnerable minority(aka The Stoner Nation). Whom after all is a pothead to turn to when he has lost his stash or misplaced his purse? The police? A crime lab? CSI? No - not any of them. They turn to Aaron Krumm a former MIT genius in String Theory now blackballed with a felony drug conviction. Without a science lab in sight and using only his wits humor and intuition Aaron solves the mysteries before him. That is if his own Mother or his Probation Officer don't get to him first.
