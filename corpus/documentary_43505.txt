Every month an estimated 200000 Australians deliberately hurt themselves. They cut scratch burn and sometimes even break bones. It's called self-harm and it peaks in teenagers and young people. The Silent Epidemic explores this dark and often secret behaviour asking why more and more people are turning to self-harm as a way to cope with life. Interweaving their personal stories with scientific enquiry The Silent Epidemic casts a unique lens onto what is fast becoming a problem that can no longer remain hidden. In response to the growing numbers a group of Melbourne scientists are hunting for a radical solution to self-harm with a world-first experiment. The Silent Epidemic charts their progress: it is both a wake-up call and ultimately a story of hope.
