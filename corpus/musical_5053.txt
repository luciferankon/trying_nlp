This fantastic interactive DVD brings the magic of babyballet alive and is a must for all little dancers! Children of all ages love to watch sing along and join in with the dancing with all the babyballet characters - Flutterby the Fairy Chuck the Cowboy and of course Twinkle & Teddy the babyballet bears. The DVD includes a selection of class favourite songs & dances plus the live show 'Twinkle's Surprise Birthday Party' which stars Neil Hurst as Grandad Jack the King of the Castle (as seen on ITV's Family Fortunes) and all the wonderful babyballet characters live on stage!
