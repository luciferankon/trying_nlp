Raul and Saul work at the same office. Raul outgoing and good-natured comes from a broken marriage. Saul is shy with a critical and bitter disposition. He comes from a broken engagement and a failed suicide attempt. In spite of their differences they become quite good friends. But their colleagues begin to wonder whether there's something beyond friendship between them.
