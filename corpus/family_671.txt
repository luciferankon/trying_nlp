In a Byelorussian village the German soldiers massacred all the family except for a small boy who was shut in a metal barrel and sent down the river. Fortunately his moaning is overheard by soldiers of the Red Army and soldier Aljosa in a heavy firing draws the barrel near to the bank. Miserable Borisek after recovery becomes a regular member of the medical military service and attains the rank of younger sergeant.
