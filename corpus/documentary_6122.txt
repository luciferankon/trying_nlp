Children with autism need early intervention programs in education and health care so they can catch up to their peers and reach their full potential. What happens when states fail to adequately fund them? Now that the autism rates are rising all over America and around the world the costs for autism-related programs are too especially in: education health care and long term adult care services. This film goes in depth about these costs. There is a lack of national strategic planning by the American government and elected officials to address these issues over the last thirty years and now our ability to support this growing population of children and adults with autism is at risk. What happens when the autism rates and costs to support this population continue to climb into the next decade or two? This film goes into detail about why we need to act now before 2025.
