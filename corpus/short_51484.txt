A poetic trip - an enigmatic free-flowing short film contemplating the cosmic unknown forces of an uncertain precarious life - featuring words by Jon Hedderwick choreography and dancing by Wes Ryan music by Moby and Davide Rossi and a good bottles of beer or two. Some things are learned in the search for dark matter - where "answers always seem to lie a mile or more away beneath the surface" and constellations of answers raise only more questions - and some things are learned by watching this movie which gives thanks to important Peterborough cultural spaces from the Only Caf√© to the Spill. "The search is the only thing that really matters."
