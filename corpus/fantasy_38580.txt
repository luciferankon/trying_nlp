Originally Earth was inhabited by the sons of God and Satan was their prince. His job was to move to and fro upon Earth to accuse those who broke the laws of the holy Creator. But pride caused Satan to put himself on equal footing with God by judging which of the Creator's laws he would follow and which he would not; thus making him one of the sons of disobedience. The Earth's inhabitants followed their ruler's lead and Earth was tossed into chaos. The Creator forgave restored and then created a new heaven and Earth but created a new ruler Adam and granted him all authority including authority over Satan and the Fallen. Jesus the Tree of Life warned Adam not to eat of Satan's teachings the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil but Satan knows how one falls from authority. The Fallen the sons of disobedience didn't appreciate being subject to mankind so they devised a plan to cause mankind to become Fallen like them fellow sons of disobedience so that they may rule the Earth as before.
