The White Horse of St. Charles is a drama set in post World War II Georgia. It is the story of a 10 year old girls fight to survive Polio against all odds. Her father is a wounded war veteran with total amnesia confined to a hospital in London England unaware that he has a daughter in Georgia living with her grandparents. His wife died in childbirth however her daughter survived and now his deceased wife as a ghost sets out to bring her daughter's father back to Georgia and to his daughter's side in the belief that his return will save his daughter. There is a huge catch which puts the little girl's survival at stake. This drama is based on the author David A. Cox's partially true story of surviving polio before there was a known vaccine. The author fictionalized parts of the story with a ghost to have a vehicle that weaves the four true stories together. He uses a girl rather than a boy because the relationship between father and daughter is a stronger bond. This is a family feature feel good film that follows the formula of good storytelling much like the films that graced the silver screen in the 40's and 50's.
