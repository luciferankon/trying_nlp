App Applegate envisioned a boat he could sail from Orcas Island to Cuba. Tucked in the forest on Mt. Picket 400' above Obstruction Pass the "Aproximada" began to slowly take shape.  Working largely alone App dedicated his time to building his 80' barkentine sailing vessel amongst the tall trees of the Pacific Northwest.  People wanted to help.  How could we get this ship down the mountain and into the bay?  As word spread visitors began to flock to this modern day Noah's Ark.  He loved the attention; he loved to talk about his ship and his thoughts on the human condition.  He also needed a bit of help along the way.  In a sense App's travels had already begun.  The act of building his ship became a way to have the world arrive at his doorstep.  Through a collection of archive footage and present day interviews video and illustrations this short film unearths the story of an amazing Orcas Island icon.  Through stories from long time friends family and associates; the film follows the story of how App's vision materialized.  Though never touching the water the "Aproximada" became the symbol of man's curiosity perseverance and determination.
