The Australian version of the popular and long-running American game show. The show presented a wide variety of contests and games all with the same basic challenge: guess the prices of everyday (and some not-so-everyday) items. The contestants whose estimates were the closest would win the prizes and move on to more difficult games with even bigger prizes.
