Thunderbirds Are Back and More a bit of a fan short yet based on the works on Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. Working as a revival bringing back Thunderbirds Fireball XL5 Captain Scarlet Stingray U.F.O and more all to the small screen. Using techniques used on the original shows and bringing back the use of puppetry. A loose story line bringing all the shows together on screen at one time.
