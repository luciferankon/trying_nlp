Young Frank Stratton the scion of a wealthy family who is temporarily short of funds has borrowed a valuable bracelet and hasn't returned it to its owner. A crooked detective Jim Foley finds the bracelet in Stratton's possession and promises not to arrest him for it in return for Stratton signing a confession that he stole it which Foley intends to use at a future date. Years pass and a political boss in danger of losing an election asks Foley's help in getting valuable papers from his opponent Worthington Lawrence. Foley knows that Lawrence is a friend of Stratton and tells Stratton that unless he steals those papers Foley will make his signed confession public. Complications ensue.
