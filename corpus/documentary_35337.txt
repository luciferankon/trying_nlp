Since 2002 Ali B occurs on the most various occasions. Through its unique combination of rap interspersed with stand-up comedy he became the most popular hip-hop artist from the Netherlands. This resulted in a sold out private theatre in 2004. Ali B stood on stage with this performance 127 times. He raps about the fun and the stress in the porches and anger and joy beneath the street light about how he made his way as an artist from a community center to Ahoy and from east of Amsterdam to Hilversum.
