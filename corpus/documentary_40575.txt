In a small rural Californian town Jack Mays sits in a white plastic chair on Main Street for fifteen years - seven days a week twelve hours a day - drawing. Then he is given three months to live. He has never placed any value on his work and has always refused to show or sell it. What he does value is his community and his connection to it through his art. When it becomes clear that other cancer victims may survive with his help he finds a purpose to his art that he could never have planned.
