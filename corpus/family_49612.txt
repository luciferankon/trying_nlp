Overlays is part of an ongoing series of videos concerning my son Kai. This video combines home recordings of Kai as an infant and at age 3 with manipulated footage of my morning train commute in Osaka Japan. The soundtrack uses an electronic tone step sequencer. Edited and mixed at the Experimental Television Center Owego New York Summer 2009.
