Paterson was born and raised in the rough area of Harlesden London and since becoming an actor has decided to return to his streets with the message of Shakespeare. Setting himself a target of four weeks to cast rehearse and direct a West End production of Romeo & Juliet Paterson plans to show the world that Harlesden is not what people assume and prove that Shakespeare can be brought to any place any people and any time by using a cast of all first time actors. In the background director Baz Luhrmann looks on and offers Paterson advice on how to bring Shakespeare alive for modern actors and audiences.
