The documentary follows both father Hayao Miyzaki and son Goro Miyazaki for 10 months as they worked on the recently released film Kokuriko-Zaka Kara (From Up on Poppy Hill (2011)) and will discuss the conflict between the two men that arose when Goro directed Tales from Earthsea (2006) against Hayao's wishes. The documentary will explore how that conflict played a part in the two working together on Kokuriko-Zaka Kara especially regarding the creation of the main character Umi. It will also examine the postponement of the film and the effect the March 11 Great Eastern Japan Earthquake (Higashi Nihon Daishinsai) disaster had on the film's production and Hayao and Goro's relationship.
