This six-part documentary series from creators Michael Selditch and Stan Bertheaud follows a group of students enrolled in Tulane University's School of Architecture a proactive and socially-conscious architecture curriculum as they design and build an affordable house intended to be sold to a needy and qualified home-buyer in post-Katrina devastated New Orleans. "Architecture School" opens a window onto the art and science of architecture while telling a unique and uplifting story about the literal rebuilding of New Orleans. Filmed during the 2007-2008 school year the series follows the construction of the third home in Tulane University's URBAN/build program which offers fourth-year architecture students the opportunity to design and build a low-cost single-family home over the course of the school year. Co-founded in 2005 by Reed Kroloff and Ila Berman URBAN/build is a partnership between Tulane's prestigious School of Architecture and Neighborhood Housing Services of New Orleans (N.H.S.) a 32-year-old nonprofit agency that works to restore urban neighborhoods and offers assistance to first-time low income home-buyers. N.H.S. facilitates the sale of the URBAN/build home and also provides the capital and land. Tulane provides the creativity expertise and manpower in the form of the students themselves. For the students URBAN/build represents a chance to see their ideas realized at an unusually early stage of their professional careers not to mention a way to contribute to a city still struggling nearly three years after Hurricane Katrina. For residents of New Orleans URBAN/build offers a chance to own an exceptional new home one built with their needs in mind.
