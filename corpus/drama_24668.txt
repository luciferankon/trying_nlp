Henning is a fashion photographer driven by visions of artistic glory. He is encouraged by a literary agent to produce a volume of erotic nudes and works to create the perfect layout with his favorite model Leslie. All seems to be going well until the mysterious Joyce appears; dark and sensual Joyce plays games with the photographer's ego driving a wedge between Henning and Leslie and seducing one of his other models. Blinded by his own ambitions Henning is unable to see the ruinous web that Joyce is weaving.
