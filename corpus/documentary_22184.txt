This concert was filmed in early 2005 at Vienna's famous jazz club Porgy Bess and features Barre Phillips on bass accompanied by John Hollenbeck on piano and drums. Interwoven with the footage is insightful artist interviews. Phillips is part of an exclusive group of well-improvising American musicians who fit comfortably into the free jazz of the '60s as well as the European free improvising scene. He has performed and recorded with many of the great Jazz artists such as Don Ellis Bobby Hutcherson Bertram Turetzky and John Surman and is the president-elect of the International Society of Bassists.
