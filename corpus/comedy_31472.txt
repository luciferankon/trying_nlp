One was an Isish policeman - his friend was a German saloon keeper. They went "over there" to fight for their country but they had more fights getting to the front than they had when they got there. And the way those Russian women made love to them made them wish they were in "No Woman's Land". Positively the funniest war story ever screened. You'll lose yourself in laughter when you see "Lost at the Front"! Don't miss it! The previous paragraphs appeared in promotional material distributed for the 1927 release.
