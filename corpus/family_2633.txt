After school on Saturday afternoon a teacher asks her 6th grade students Budi and Rosi to take charge of raising the flag for next Monday's ceremony. Because the flag is dirty the teacher asks them to take it home and to wash it. The kids go through many adventures as a result of taking the flag home. They nevertherless feel responsible to protect the flag until Monday's ceremony.
