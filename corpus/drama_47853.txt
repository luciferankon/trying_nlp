Henry Lee comes upon a crowd gathered outside the Panama Hotel once the gateway to Seattle's Japantown. It's been boarded up for decades but now the new owner has made an incredible discovery: the belongings of 37 Japanese families left when they were rounded up and sent to internment camps during World War II. As Henry looks on the owner opens a Japanese parasol. This simple act takes old Henry back to the 1940s at the height of the war when young Henry's world is a jumble of confusion and excitement and to his father who is obsessed with the war in China and having Henry grow up American. While "scholarshipping" at the exclusive Rainier Elementary where the white kidsignore him Henry meets Keiko Okabe a young Japanese American girl. Amid the chaos of blackouts curfews and FBI raids Henry and Keiko forge a bond of friendship-and innocent love-that transcends the long-standing prejudices of their Old World ancestors. But after Keiko and her family are swept up in the evacuations to the Camp Minidoka she and Henry are left only with the hope that the war will end and that their promise to each other will be kept. Forty years later Henry Lee is certain that the parasol belonged to Keiko. In the hotel's dusty basement he begins looking for signs of the Okabe family's belongings and for a long-lost object whose value he cannot begin to measure. Now a widower Henry is still trying to find his voice-words that might explain the actions of his nationalistic father; words that might bridge the gap between him and his modern Chinese American son; words that might help him confront the choices he made many years ago. Set during one of the most conflicted and volatile times in American history Hotelon the Corner of Bitter and Sweet is a story of commitment and enduring hope.
