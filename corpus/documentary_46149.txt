The Danish artist Nikolaj Larsen's 'Promised Land' depicts the final stage of a group of young men's dramatic journey from war-torn regimes in Iran and Afghanistan to life as a refugee in Europe. Reza and his three-year-old son live in the ruins of an old building while they wait and hope for the opportunity to make it to England to get a job and the chance at a better life. Muhammed Jafar and Hasan hang out by a depressing and foggy harbour in the French town of Calais. They will do anything to cross the Channel and reach the UK which lies just 35km away. After several dangerous experiments with trucks they finally have a foolproof plan - which involves swimming and a ship. The only problem is: Hasan can't swim. By combining evocative cinematography with footage shot by the immigrants themselves the film provides an insight into their close friendships their hopes their dreams and their coping mechanisms for life's miseries. Funny situations arise between the friends along the way but the drone-heavy soundtrack also contributes to an atmospheric mood in a film about people for whom everything is at stake.
