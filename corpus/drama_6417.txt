In Singapore Captain Robert Anstruthers attempts to protect his friend Colonel Costabel from scandal since the colonel's wife is having an affair with Lord Ventnor. When Costabel travels to the interior his wife and Ventnor have a rendezvous. Upon his return Costabel discovers Ventnor's hat in his wife's boudoir. His wife tells him that Anstruthers has been annoying her and that Ventnor was trying to protect her from him. Anstruthers is court-martialed and sent away in disgrace. He enlists in the navy under the name of Robert Jenks and becomes a sailor aboard ship owned by Sir Arthur Deane. During a typhoon which wrecks the ship Anstruthers saves the live of Deane's daughter Iris. For several weeks the two live alone on an island. They discover a gold mine but are set upon by a band of pirates. Deane and Ventnor arrive on a gun boat and defeat the pirates. When Iris announces her engagement to Anstruthers Ventnor tells Deane that if he does not break his daughter's engagement he will withdraw his financial support. Deane refuses to interfere and Anstruthers and Iris get married. Costabel's wife who is enraged that Ventnor went in search of Iris confesses everything to her husband and Anstruthers' commission is restored.
