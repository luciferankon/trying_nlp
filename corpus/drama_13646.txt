An eighteen-year-old delinquent was recently released from a juvenile detention center. He returns to his parent's old home with a clean criminal record and a new identity. However local villagers sense an injustice in this lack of punishment; they remember what happened there just a few years earlier. Also an ambitious filmmaker has decided to follow and document this delinquent's return to a 'normal' life. With the backdrop of contemporary society where "everything is meaningless and nothing is real" this story of maturity and guilt unfolds.
