The film the voting machine corporations don't want you to see. HACKING DEMOCRACY follows investigator/grandmother Bev Harris and her citizen-activists as they set out to uncover how America counts its votes. Proving the votes can be stolen without a trace culminates in a duel between the Diebold corporation's voting machines and a computer hacker - with America's democracy at stake.
