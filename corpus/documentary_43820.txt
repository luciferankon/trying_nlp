A puffing steam train climbs into the Himalaya a rolling rumble echoes over the holy waters of the Ganges an astonishing five million commuters rush daily through the Bombay Victoria Terminus - join National Geographic as we journey on one of the world's largest railways. Since 1853 India's railway has been a unifying force. Not only did it physically link distant regions it also connected the myriad of castes languages and religions that comprise India. It's a rich history riding the sumptuous Palace on Wheels through Rajasthan or the "toy train" to Darjiing but sadly the age of steam is dying. At the Black Beauty contest the beloved steam engines are admired for the last time. From the driver in the steaming locomotive to the station master in the sleepy village from the family traveling to a wedding to the commuters in the large cities this great institution reflects the country itself. Many are the faces and varied are the stories on THE GREAT INDIAN RAILWAY.
