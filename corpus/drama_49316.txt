September 1942. Rural Polish Jews go into hiding. Nachman Liba their four sons and two teen neighbors go underground digging a pit bunker where they hide during the day. One girl can't take it and runs away; her sister follows. Clothes rot and winter forces the family into an abandoned ice house near a German barracks; they wear burlap bags and eat stolen potatoes. Again they must move: for a year they live in a remote barn. Barely escaping detection they flee to the forest exhausted and find others in hiding. Even as the Germans retreat Polish collaborators hunt for Jews; the family remains at grave risk. By war's end some have survived to tell their story.
