The Wayneys are an amazing family: good looking MENSA smart talented athletic and popular to boot. Paige (Ringwald) and Wayne Wayney (Priestley) have worked hard at raising "multi-exceptional" offspring and are proud of their children: Adam Conner Bentley and Derek. Everyone in town envies them or wants to be them and you can even find Paige's book about raising her extraordinary family on the bestseller list. But alas their fifth child Emmett is not marching in lock step on the path to familial greatness. What he lacks academically athletically or artistically he makes up for with relentless enthusiasm and curiosity. Emmett knows that one day he'll find his way but in the meantime he's determined to celebrate his C-average status in spectacular creative fashion - no matter how often his best laid plans threaten to destroy the family's living space reputation or sense of safety.
