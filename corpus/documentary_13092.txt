Is it hot in here or am I the only one dressed for Poland in the 17th century? Yisrael Campbell looks more like a rabbi than a comedian but don't be fooled by the big black hat frock coat and Hasidic side-curls. Born Chris Campbell the son of an ex-nun and a Catholic schoolteacher he converted to Judaism not once but three times - Reform Conservative and Orthodox. His spiritual journey began as a drug-drenched teenager in Philadelphia and ended in Jerusalem among the suicide bombs of the Palestinian intifada. So what's to laugh about? It's the way he tells it. CIRCUMCISE ME is a hilarious searching and moving story of one man's quest for spiritual enlightenment against the bewildering backdrop of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
