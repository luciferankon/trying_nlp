&lt;p&gt;Recommended by the National Education Association this folksy Americanized retelling of Cinderella spins a more realistic yarn void of princes and fairy godmothers. The place: a woodsy sweltering Southern town; the time: pre-World War II. Picture two rude stepsisters their ambivalent mother and a sweet teenager nicknamed Ashpet (in the original German story her name was Aschenputtel "Cinder Maid"). True to the original Brothers Grimm tale this kindhearted lackey obeys every demand. Foremost the stepsisters order Ashpet to fetch love sachets from "Dark Sally" an intimidating conjure woman so they can attract mates at the town Victory dance--a soir√©e honoring the local boys who are headed off to war (and a rare event in this modest town). Not a problem: Dark Sally adores Ashpet and intends to make her the belle of the ball. Rather than whipping out a magic wand Dark Sally encourages Ashpet to bathe in a remote pond and don a knockout dress (once her mother's) hidden in a secret room of the house. The rest of the tale missing slipper included runs much as expected. But its subtle humor smart dialogue and creative setting make Ashpet play like a tall icy glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade on the senses; it's a refreshing 45-minute substitute for other rather syrupy Cinderella stories. --Liane Thomas &lt;b&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Winner of many awards including Kids First Award Parents Choice Award American Library Association's "Selected Films for Young Adults" American Library Association's "Notable Films for Children" Best Short Subject at the Philadelphia International Film Festival Best Children's Entertainment Film at the American Film Festival
