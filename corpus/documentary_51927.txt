This is the story of how a shellshocked World War One veteran who'd left school at 12 ended up creating a national icon. An inspiring man with bold and imaginative ideas Fletcher Jones was influenced by Japanese reformer Toyohiko Kagawa one of the most remarkable social activists of his time. Jones established his clothing design retail and manufacturing business with an emphasis on quality service and innovation. But his primary concern was for people - both his customers and his workers - and they in turn were intensely loyal. This is a celebration of the man and his dream - of a model working environment based on values other than simple profit - set against the backdrop of 20th century history.
