Near the Bohemian town of Lety in the Czech Republic there is a pig farm occupying what was once a Czech-run concentration camp for 'Gypsies'. While human rights activists and Roma groups have been lobbying for the removal of the farm and calling for a dignified monument at the site ethnic Czech citizens and government have agreed that moving the farm would be bad for business. Hauntingly shot by award-winning cinematographer Petr Koblovsky Pig Farm witnesses a day in the life of Emil Cina an affable Romany poet as he travels to the Lety Memorial Ceremony. There he gathers with Roma to honour their murdered kin and to demonstrate their need for change in the system that is complicit in their ghettoization and destruction to this day. Cut with time capsules of astonishing events 'Pig Farm' chronicles five years in the story of a special brand of activism questioning why after 700 years of living in the region the Roma have been unable to integrate into Czech society.
