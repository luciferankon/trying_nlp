I Talk Otherwise is a movie about a journey along the Danube seen from the viewpoint of the river itself. It has been shooted in 8 countries and 9 languages from West to East from Capitalism to Communism from the Black Forest to the Black Sea flowing between the mixtures the rafts and the cultural contradictions of the lands crossed by the great river. Conceived as a road movie it trails the river from its source in Germany across Austria and some former Communist countries - Slovakia Hungary Croatia Serbia Bulgaria Romania - all the way to its mouth in the Black Sea on a journey from the past to the future of the Europe. The Danube with its singular and yet multifaceted point of view a perspective that remarkably reflects its distinctive character becomes an unambiguous elusive guide. An allegoric emblem of the journey taken between the spiraling ideals of the modern man; through reminiscences representations metamorphoses that have catalyzed the life and the transitions of the Twentieth Century. Sounding the traces of tradition in all their reticence in places where they clash with the arrogant modernity the river flows towards its future and accompanies us to the discovery of our past. The Black Sea proves to be a return to the origins a "meta-final" of a backward journey which reveals once again the jagged horizon of contemporaneity.
