This video references how people describe their feelings when they are writing diaries. It answered my question of why do people write diaries and formed my understanding of diary which is the way of settling down and deeply communicating with self. This work uses metaphor as a tool to present my personal interpretation of diary and gives metaphorical meanings to different objects used to express the various contents that people normally put into their diary. Such as: red balls rice and woolen yarn. In addition the way of manipulating these materials is not just present in the video but using body movements. Specifically my talent who is a dancer uses movements to express the diary contents. Using metaphor to present this concept leaves the audience with an opportunity to find their own interpretation of diary.
