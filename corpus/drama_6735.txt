Will Cole is a charismatic 35 year old paper mill laborer who seems to celebrate a life of bad choices. He lives and behaves as if he was still 18 womanizing and drinking and rejecting responsibility because he sees no reason to take life seriously. Surprisingly enough despite his devil-may-care attitude he has several important people in his life. He maintains a special relationship with Stan an old mentor who lives in a nursing home and Ruth the only woman he truly cares about. Andrew is his best friend but grows tired of Will's antics and he is soon to be married and moving on. Will constantly has something up his sleeve but his pranks inevitably bring pain and tragedy to those closest to him forcing him to reevaluate his life and make some difficult decisions.
