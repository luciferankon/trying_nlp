Since the 2008 banking crisis the world of finance has continued to generate confusion and hostility in most people's minds. Not only do women in senior positions in this field represent a tiny minority (around 7% of senior positions) but they are also stigmatized as traitors or satanic 'dragon women'. In this documentary five fierce women in the world of finance - aged 25 to 65 - try to maintain a balance between their work and private life. Filmed in their sleek offices at home and during their leisure time they explain how they have had to transform their femininity to remain 'in the game'. Rules mostly by a white Christian male view the finance sector counts a minority of women (around 16% of senior positions) still stigmatized today as 'Dragon Women'. In this documentary we follow six senior women in the industry embracing reflecting upon or resisting the masculine metamorphosis one has to undergo in order to remain 'in the game'.
