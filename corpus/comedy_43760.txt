Four waiters and a cook working at a seaside restaurant hate each other but still keep working together for lack of better opportunities. One day the old owner sells the restaurant to a wealthy industrialist who must decide whether to keep it or turn it into a furniture showroom. During a last luncheon for the new owner the waiters will have to prove their worth to save their jobs.
