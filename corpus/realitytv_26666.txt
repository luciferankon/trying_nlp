Escaping Alaska follows a group of young Eskimos (Nuala Mary Tamara Frank and Q) as they leave their villages for the first time and secretly escape to San Diego defying the expectations of their families in order to experience life beyond the harsh realities of Alaska. They are a generation torn between their deep-rooted cultural traditions and the modern pop culture of the lower 48 states. This is their story of independence survival adventure and forming a new family. Leaving an Inuit community for any earthly reason is difficult so our cast members are lying about their true intentions telling their community that they are going on a cultural/religious mission.
