An angry employee does what we only dream of doing at our day jobs. Holding in much of his frustration an office worker barely can hide the mental stress from his boss' sadistic demands. His boss finally yells him over the deep end and the young man explodes pushing both himself and the boss to deep rage. The musical onslaught of Mindscape by Age of Aggression accompanies his mania as he runs from his monstrous superior through the gritty streets of downtown San Francisco. . . Now take that flip it and watch it backwards! Avant-garde writer/director Ezra J. Stanley and cinematographer Alejandro Wilkins design an unforgettable cinematic music video!
