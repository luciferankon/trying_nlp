Anthony Caldarella's debut feature is a semi-autobiographical account of a working-class Italian-American family living on Manhattan's lower east side in the mid-sixties. Rose Casale and her four sons - Sal who runs a local trattoria Vincent a struggling blues singer Jack a charismatic magician and Joey the youngest - have achieved a level of sustenance that any family would cherish. But at 24 Jack has replaced his love of magic with an uncontrollable craving for heroin and his addiction tests the family's mettle.
