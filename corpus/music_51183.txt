Like a favorite aunt who comes calling when you're on the edge of disaster wisdom's arrival is always welcome. Bringing perspective and a wealth of graceful options she saves the day. Wisdom cannot be legislated purchased or stolen. She is seldom possessed by the young and never assured in the elderly. Wisdom is the product of a life well-lived with roads less traveled by friendships nurtured and burdens carried. Like a long-suffering mother wisdom knows deeply her own and cares for them through the twists and turns of this harrowing journey.
