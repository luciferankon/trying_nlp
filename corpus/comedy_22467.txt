Pablo has no social life to speak of. And he seems to like it that way. He goes to the same Chinese restaurant every night orders the same takeout meal and eats it alone at his dining room table. Then one night his best friend and business partner drags Pablo down to a school reunion party where he runs into Daniela with whom he had a crush back in the day. Daniela's life hasn't been easy; she now makes ends meet as a prostitute. Undeterred Pablo attempts to conquer her at all costs with the reluctant help of his business partner and the more enthusiastic one of the Haitian immigrants who work for him.
