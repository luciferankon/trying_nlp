On October 30 2009 an independent filmmaker and his cast and crew are reported missing a month before the release of their controversial film predicting the end of the world. Authorities have reason to believe the film's 2012 doomsday scenario may have something to do with their disappearance. An agent for CEA (Central Extraterrestrial Agency) discovers the footage to the film and watches the film on September 10 2012 three months before the world is to come to an end. The film is reported to star actors Brian Neil Hoff (Automaton) Shy Pilgreen (Echo 6) and Xu Razer (Fragments.) Here is the synopsis to the mystery film. In 2012 a devastating war between humans and aliens left the earth a nuclear wasteland. 200 years later the descendants of both civilizations have returned in search of treasure and lost artifacts. After landing their ship on the abandoned planet three galactic thieves Kaynin Rune and Archer descend into an underground city. Soon a series of mechanical malfunctions leaves them trapped inside the vast structure below fighting for their lives as a sinister figure lurks in the shadows. Hidden in the rubble and debris lie the clues to the planet's final days and in order to survive they must unravel their meaning before time runs out.
