In Series 1 Junior MasterChef auditioned 5500 hopeful young cooks aged from 8 to 12 from across Australia to arrive at a Top 50 who then competed for a place in the Top 12. These plucky finalists faced grueling Pressure and Invention Tests and Team Challenges as they endeavoured to score as many points as possible from judges Gary Mehigan George Calombaris Matt Preston and Anna Gare. Shine Australia brings Season Two of Junior MasterChef Australia back in 2011. The contestants will still be small but the show will be bigger and better than before bubbling over with surprise new tests and celebrity guests.
