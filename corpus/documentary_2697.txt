In dreamlike fashion Bicycle Day explores the effects of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) through the use of a variety of source materials including news reports and films about the controlled use of psychedelics. Through its clinical purview the film pays homage to Albert Hofmann who first synthesized LSD while working in the pharmaceutical-chemical department of Sandoz Laboratories in Basel Switzerland in a quest for a powerful psychiatric tool. The title Bicycle Day refers to the day Hofmann performed the initial experiment on himself. Although he wildly overestimated the necessary dose and experienced a harrowing trip home from the laboratory by bicycle he eventually acclimated and experienced exquisite and intense pleasures.
