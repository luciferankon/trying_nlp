From award-winning writer and director Roseanne Liang (Banana In A Nutshell Flat3) comes UNBOXED a bite-sized series exploring the glorious highs and hilarious lows of artificial intelligence. Friday Night Bites' JJ Fong Perlina Lau and Ally Xue star as three friends who agree to take part in an unusual beta test where they must spend 24 hours with an "anatomically exceptional" AI called J (Peter Sudarso). There are no rules...just their imagination.
