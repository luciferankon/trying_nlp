After 12 years of absence a filmmaker is returning to Israel in search for answers. What starts as a personal journey will turn into an intimate portrait of surprisingly different women in a war stricken land. Noga is a high school teenager who is eager to be accepted into the best unit of the Israeli army. Moran is a religious social worker who has chosen as a home town Sderot which is under the threat of rockets. In this Israeli-Jewish town also lives Hanadi a young Arab woman from the northern part of the country fighting for her identity.
