In the name of "the struggle against terrorism" a special operation - code named CONDOR - was conducted in the seventies and eighties in South America. Its target were left wing political dissidents the organised labour and intellectuals. Condor soon became a network of Military Dictatorships supported by the US State Department the CIA and Interpol. The film by Rodrigo Vasquez a young Argentinian director tells that story by following several victims of Operation Condor fighting for the truth and by meeting key members of the Condor network themselves who -after 9/11/2001- openly claim being pioneers of the current fight against "international terrorism".
