Two hearing protection product sales reps have mixed fortunes in the exercise of their trades. They first have to face a female singer who... slams her door at them! Second they try to a influence a man by giving one of his friends'name as a reference whereas the aforementioned friend is... on the spot! As for the third client he seems to be willing to buy one of their articles until the two salesmen realize that he is... hard of hearing!
