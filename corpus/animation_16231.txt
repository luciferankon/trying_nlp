When It Was Blue is a live ephemeral film performance and an ode to a beautiful and unspoiled natural environment which is fast diminishing. When It Was Blue rejoices the splendor of the natural world through a complex and dazzling fusion of textural abstract hand-painted images projected onto filmed landscapes from Iceland New Zealand and Vancouver to Pyramid Lake Nevada and upstate New York.16mm double-projected film and montage by Jennifer Reeves Music by Sk√∫i Sverrisson with Anthony Burr & Ted Reichman.
