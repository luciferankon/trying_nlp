Adapting memorable moments from the likes of "Return of the Dragon" and "Snake in the Eagle's Shadow" director Eric Spoeth (N.D.E) tells the story of two feuding Karate schools the Rabid Dogs and Noble Flamingos and one student's quest for justice. Featuring an entirely dubbed soundtrack starring local voice talent Crane exhibits all the pomp clich√©s and comedy of the genre.
