New game show that will help viewers figure out how normal (or not) they are! Have you ever peeked at your boyfriend's emails? Or done your household chores naked? Do you and your spouse sleep in separate bedrooms? In addition to ourselves we also wonder about the people around us: boyfriends girlfriends co-workers and neighbors. This lively game show will answer our most burning questions by using a highly scientific and deeply revealing poll in addition to a jury of real Americans man-on-the-street polling real life situations shot in the field and in-studio demonstrations. Each episode will feature contestants who will win big money in their quest to learn if they're normal or not.
