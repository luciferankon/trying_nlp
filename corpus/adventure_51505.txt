Samantha Browne has been waiting patiently in her room for everyone else to fall asleep go out or do whatever it is people who enjoy social interaction do. She's hungry. Okay she's past hungry. She's at whatever stage is right after hungry. It's not that she doesn't have food she has a box of oatmeal just sitting on her shelf waiting for her consumption. Thing is she needs some help. Your help specifically and well helping Sam isn't always easy.
