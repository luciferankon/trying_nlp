A good-natured light-hearted wholesome family comedy about three frustrated dreamers -- David Larson (Lawrence Gardner) a struggling filmmaker; Glenn Brooks (Peter Petty) a wacky artist; and Glenn's brother Jack Brooks (Roy Conrad) a small-time entrepreneur -- who meet cute and decide to form a motion picture production company. Because David is the only one with any filmmaking experience their attempt to produce a feature film sets the stage for a variety of bizarrely funny situations as they endeavor to cope with all of the unforeseen factors that affect the success or failure of their film.
