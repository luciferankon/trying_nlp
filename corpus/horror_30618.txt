The Innocent follows four university students who decide to make their last night of spring break a memorable one by camping over night at a derelict hotel. Little do they know what is waiting in store for them as the more they explore and the further they delve less and less do things appear to be as they seem. Chilling to the bone and disturbing at best The Innocent portrays an eerily real world that doesn't make sense until it's all too late. The students begin their camp-over with drink drugs and laughter but as their intrigue grows to their new found dwelling so does the hotels curiosity of them until they are all alone all confused and all scared beyond themselves.
