Through a habitual excursion of a father his son and his two friends to Mar Chiquita Lake Little Devils Go to Heaven explores the conflict of protecting a wild landscape in the face of the rights of native people to access and enjoy their original lands. This piece focuses on a wild landscape that served as a last refuge for the native people of central Argentina the Mar Chiquita Lake. This lake one of the largest and wildest masses of waters in South America is presently almost inaccessible since in most areas the coastal lands belong to private owners. Impaired access added to the prohibition of making bonfires and hunting further removes this landscape from its original inhabitants. Firewood-perhaps one of the few goods that native people can legally profit from-and fire are definitely the symbol of a culture that has not disappeared. The ideologue of Argentine's Constitution stated as he was drafting it "To govern is to populate... to populate it with people from Europe." This tension between native or mestizos and the white population in Argentina is very strong up to today but it still goes largely unacknowledged.
