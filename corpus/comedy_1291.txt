Crazy Venice Apartment - as the name speaks for itself - is a series that takes place in a beach apartment inhabited by an overly diverse group of friends: Cody ( an unstable closet gay narcissistic guy who is talented and highly motivated); John (Cody's business partner who is a couch crasher and has an imaginary twin Ty); Katya (Cody's Russian girlfriend naive romantic and a total control freak); Craig (Political activist angry and unhappy with his life but really nice on the outside); Crazy Professor Feep a hopeless Romantic; and Daniel a total workaholic. During the course of the show a few new characters will 'move in' to spice up the apartment: Samuel a confident black guy quite the successful guy with women not so much with work; Romi a German actress who is easy going when it comes to parties and men; Jesse who just happens to be fucked up! Getting high every day all day long playing poker fucking with each other and bringing guys and girls for the night from time to time; this is how they live their life. But that is not all they dream of; they wish to be Hollywood stars rock-stars rocket scientist and of course to meet the right one have a family and grow old together with them. With so many different personalities living under the same roof is no wonder crazy things happen on daily basis.
