One hour before the State Opening of Parliament something very unusual happens. The Prime Minister appears and demands an adjustment to the Queen's speech. The speech concerns aid to Africa. Even with all the pressure around the State Opening Beatrix goes back in time and remembers her banishment to Canada the visit to the victims of the Flood disaster and the turbulence suffered by her parents at Palace Soestdijk during the Hofman case. Dutch queen-regnant Beatrix stubbornly resists last-minute changes decided by PM Balkenende's cabinet on the day of her annual grand state opening of parliament in The Hague. It concerns a promise to spend more on Africa an obsession she shared with late prince-consort Claus. Concerting with crown prince Willem Alexander who sides with parliamentary rule evokes other dynastic traumas such as his controversial marriage and possible renunciation from her succession.
