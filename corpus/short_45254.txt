A stone building newly restored stands in the clear light of the autumnal equinox. People move along the street immersed in the flow of day-to-day events. Small incidents play out affecting individual lives. Families are leaving their homes people on the street are carrying personal possessions and all actions become colored by an increasing tension in the community. Moments of compassion and kindness circulate within a mounting concern for individual survival. A final moment of panic ensues on the street as individuals rush to save themselves. The last ones in denial of the inevitable have waited too long in the security of their own homes. Now they must run for their lives as the deluge strikes with full force at the heart of their private world.
