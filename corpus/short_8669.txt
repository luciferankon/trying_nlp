In a modern city people live side by side but still in completely different worlds. Anis is a young immigrant girl who isolates herself in her room. In a well-lit living room across the yard a young blonde girl plays her cello every night. Anis is fascinated by the girl with the cello and one night Anis calls her and asks her to play so she can hear the music over the phone.
