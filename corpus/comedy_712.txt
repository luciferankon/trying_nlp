Vaclav Hrubes ('Jan Budar (I)' (qv)) and Josef Mares ('Richard Krajco (III)' (qv)) are pals: They have no money; they are neither too smart nor too handsome. Hrubes works as a ticket inspector Mares has no job at all. However he is a prominent member of the fan club of the Czech pop star 'Hana Zagorová' (qv) and tries to lose weight each month with a different method. Both intensely long for love women and a nice job. When his despotic father ('Miroslav Donutil' (qv)) kicks Hrubes out of his home his mother ('Iva Janzurová' (qv)) is on the brink of a nervous breakdown and Mares's grandmother dies our two guys start to live together.
