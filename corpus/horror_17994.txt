It is the last day of school and summer break has begun. A group of teenagers decide to go camping in the forest outside of the city limits of Coos Bay OR. The teens arrive in a beautiful well preserved area of the forest and set up camp there. It is not long that the group finds out that they are not alone and how much danger they are really in. The forest spirit that is believed to dwell within has set its sight upon everyone and will rest at nothing until all are dead.
