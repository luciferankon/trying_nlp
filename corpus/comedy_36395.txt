A rich Brazilian Mendoza visited Paris in 1900 and was romantically involved with the star of Offenbach's "La Vie Parisienne" which was playing at the time. Thirty five years later he returns with his son and granddaughter who is engaged to a young Frenchman. But Mendoza's puritanical son forbids the marriage. Mendoza and the actress's friends conspire to change his mind and soon succeed in converting him to "Parisian life".
