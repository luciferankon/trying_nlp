A story of the rise and fall of the Israeli daily newspaper "News" ("Hadashot"). The newspaper was founded in the early 80's and had dramatic effect on Israeli press and society in general. Six of Israel's most influential and acclaimed journalists who started their careers within the innovative and feisty newspaper's headquarters reminisce and examine in retrospect their scoops and their struggles with censorship with the conservative press around them and with their own conscience. Miki Rozenthal Reno Zror Raudor Benzimen Yigal Sarna Natan Zahavi and Alex Levac deal with the controversial legacy that changed the face of journalism in Israel: Exposing false ISA report of the "300 Bus" affair the daring and personal style of reporting blood-pornography nudity and relentless gossip. How did all this contribute to the shift in Israeli society in recent decades; from a polite and moral society (in its' own eyes) respectful of its' governing institutes turned into a know-it-all witty and venomous society impertinent impatient contemptuous and untrusting of any institute.
