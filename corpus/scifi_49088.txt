Centuries later he reappears as if having learned to deceive death and discovers the location of Eron with the help of a young apprentice and the reinvigorated Imperial forces. Master Zui Mar and young Hope who is overshadowed by a terrible secret are sent to stop him. However the Council carefully abstain from revealing all that awaits the two warriors and the terrible destiny they have foreseen for them.
