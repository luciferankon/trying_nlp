On the 12th of September 2008 Joe gave a performance of a lifetime at the ancient amphitheatre of Kourion on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus. Amidst the dramatic 2500 year old ruins Joe delivered on his promise to give a concert worthy of the Gods. In a 2 hour show he dazzled the audience with a blistering performance of international impressions and songs from his latest album.
