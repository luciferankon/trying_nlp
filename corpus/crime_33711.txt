This was a great experiment. Seven Danish television channels were on the air at the same time with four different movies each made by one of the four directors. All four movies runs 70 minutes and was recorded from ca 11.05 31/12 1999 to 0.15 1/1 2000. This is a onetime movie because on 1/1/2000 you where supposed to edit your own version from the four movies running simultaneous plus a recording of the room in which the directors where sitting co-ordinating the whole thing. Each director had one main character and one camera team that followed this person. The remote control was your cutting device and no one saw the same movie that night. But the plot was the same for all: Four people has planned to rob a bank and they shall use the noise from the new year celebration to hide the explosion. We follow them in the hour around the robbery.
