In some counties length is everything. Every Spring since 1928 thousands converge upon Calaveras County to see whose frog will jump the farthest. JUMP follows the sweat and sacrifice of those who yearn to be the County's top frog jockey - and be enshrined on the Hop of Fame. This heartfelt "frogumentary" uncovers an historical community that still honors its feisty connection to a Wild West past. Inspired by a true fable: Mark Twain's "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County."
