As two New York City knuckleheads find their ultimate goal of moving to 'Hollywood' to make it 'BIG' shattered there's nothing left to do but dream. With all hope gone and twenty dollars in their pocket they roam the streets and miraculously encounter a neurotic would-be actress now a 'homeless girl' that just so happens to have three one way bus tickets to Los Angeles. But as luck should have it the tickets expire in 24 Hours. Not so easy as it seems because the tickets are in her ex-boyfriend's house that just so happens wants her dead.
