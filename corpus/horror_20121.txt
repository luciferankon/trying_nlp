Demon Messenger is the tale of a farm family that has been torn apart by the lure of big money from the natural gas that lies in the Marcellus shale formation beneath their property. Most of the family members want to sell the land and cash out but one is a member of an anti-fracking organization and is trying to preserve their land from the dangers of hydrofracking. In an act of desperation the American Indian Legend of the Demon Messenger is called out to protect the land.
