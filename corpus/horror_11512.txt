Brad Masters enters a contest and wins an album by his favorite band of all time Living Corpse. The tape has a special song called "Zombiefied" which turns Brad and his friends into zombies at a party. Luckily Brad's girlfriend Angel misses the party and it is up to her to save her friends. She runs into Shengar (lead singer of Living Corpse and ruler of the dead world)  who attempts to stop Angel. During Angel's escape she teams up with her friend Tommy who learns that there is only way to stop the zombies. Now Angel and Tommy have limited time to figure out how to reverse the zombie curse and save their friends. DMZ is known for it's strangely original story.
