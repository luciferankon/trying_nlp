MADE IN PAKISTAN is an insider's look into "The Most Dangerous Country in the World" as labeled by a cover story in Newsweek Oct 29th 2007. The documentary follows the lives of four Pakistani individuals who defy this prevailing stereotype of the country by the very choices they have made in their lives. They are working professionals - two women entrepreneurs a politician and a lawyer. These four individuals represent a multifaceted Pakistan - a country where politics fashion religion debate and tradition intermingle - where one definition of an Islamic State no longer holds true.
