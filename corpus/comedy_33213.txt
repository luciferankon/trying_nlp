Sometimes codependency is really really fun. Meet Jenny and Julie: a pair of millennial social-activists who don't believe in online dating or the patriarchy. And who make about twelve dollars a week. Between them. When the two get booted from the storefront they're squatting in they have no choice but to pack up the Subaru and hit the road. It's like Thelma and Louise. Without murder. Or suicide. Plus iPhones. Just watch it.
