In the aftermath of the fatal Airbus A320 accident of Lufthansa at Warsaw (14.09.1993) this film looks into the man-machine interface problems with modern Airbus aircraft. The manufacturer was not pleased when this film was first aired on German public TV in January 1995. With the help of the Hamburg High-Court and even going so far to use false statements under oath by two of their senior management members Airbus succeeded initially to prevent this film from further being broadcasted. But after 8 years of proceedings in Court the case was withdrawn and the film can be shown again.
