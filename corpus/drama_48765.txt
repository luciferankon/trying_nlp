Coming from a country like India that is still in denial where being HIV+ is still a curse '68 Pages' rips open the underbelly of its society to reveal how it stigmatizes and shuns those who are HIV+ or even those who just want to be what they are. Through 68 Pages of a counselors diary we see the stories of Paayal a sex worker; Nishit an ID user; Kiran a gay man and Umrao a transsexual bar dancer - their stories of pain and fear humiliation and rejection - not only by the society but even by their loved ones. While these stories expose the shallowness of the system it also offers hope and healing by trying to bring about a better understanding of their fight to live with dignity. The film is a tribute to the human spirit of optimism and survival.
