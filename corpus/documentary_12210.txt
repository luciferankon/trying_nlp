For nearly 20 years a civil war raged in northern Uganda - The rebels of the LRA (Lord's Resistance Army) were waging a bloody guerilla campaign. They abducted children and conscripted them as soldiers forcing them to kill their own people. The film Lost Children documents the lives of four children from 8 to 14 years old who successfully escaped the LRA.
