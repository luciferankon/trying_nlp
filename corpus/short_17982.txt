Sandy-Sue is a waitress at a cheap diner. Her co-workers are all but helpful. Life's always an adventure. Not really but when things get awkward she looks to the mind and not the outer image. Is Sandy-Sue just crazy or a girl who uses her over active imagination to get through the day? Follow her on this average day maybe with the help of a banana hungry ape a green witch or a homeless clown will help you figure out this one.
