The Antarctica Legacy crossing will cover close to 4000 kilometers on skis and kites passing through the Pole of Inaccessibility-the farthest point inland from any coast-and the South Pole to end at Hercules Inlet at the edge of the Ronne ice shelf. The men will link two points never traveled before setting tracks in places where no man has ever been.
