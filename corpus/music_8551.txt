The breathtaking recital given by Cyprien Katsaris aged 28 on 7 July 1979 at the Echternach International Festival in Luxembourg. Filmed by the eminent French director Claude Chabrol Cyprien beguiled his audience with an eclectic programme bringing together works as diverse as Schumann's Scenes from Childhood Schubert's Ave Maria arranged by Liszt the Funeral Prelude and March of Liszt himself and Messiaen's Regard de l'Ã‰glise d'Amour.
