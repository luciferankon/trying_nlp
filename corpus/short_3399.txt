The freighter upon which Allan "Blank" a naval seaman is serving is torpedoed. He survives the incident seemingly both physically and mentally. His service completed Allan dreams of buying some farmland in California which he looks at with one of his shipmates Jack Stuart. However after a twenty minute absence Allan returns in an emotional state looks as if he had been rolling around in some dust and the money which he was to use to buy the property is missing from his being. He is admitted into the Pacific Rest Home the result of the this confused mental state which includes now being violent toward Jack. Once Jack tells the doctors what he knows of Allan's story the doctors use dream therapy to uncover what is buried deep within Allan's memory to discover what led to his mental collapse and what happened to the missing money. A World War II combat veteran is in an institution following the loss of his savings. Allen [Blank] is a patient at Pacific Rest Home. We see the events that led up to his hospitalization: he's an Able Seaman suffering from shock after a torpedo attack. Things are fine until the day he's to buy a small farm in California. He signs the contract but can't find his money belt. He doesn't remember where he put it. After a week digging around the farm thinking maybe he buried it he's exhausted and sent to the asylum. With the help of Allen's Navy buddy the clinic's doctor recreates the day the money disappeared hoping to dislodge through dreams the memory that will save Allen's mind.
