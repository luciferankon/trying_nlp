This documentary examines how we deal with the Romans in the living room. Are they enemies or are they the civilizing power of the past? Is it the works of Shakespeare the running gags of Frankie Howerd or the mob style family drama made famous by I Claudius or something completely different? In interviews with critics writers and historians the role of the Romans is examined in some detail.
