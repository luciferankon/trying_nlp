The year is 2032. The entire population is under a new leader 'The Regime'. Using pills that numb the recipient of all emotion The Regime has ensured a world of civilians with only one goal in mind "Work.Serve.Obey". We follow the story of Alex whose entire existence unravels when her pill doesn't turn up one morning and she gets a taste of what it's like to live her life with emotions. Bound explores the delicate nature of human feeling and has been inspired by issues surrounding mental health particularly that of depression and anxiety.
