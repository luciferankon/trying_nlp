Jerry J. Garanyan an ambulance-chasing lawyer lapses into a deep depression after he is scammed out of his retirement savings. His intense love of W.C. Fields of whom he does impersonations and his commitment to both his mixed-up half-sister Karen (who is going deaf and learning sign language) and their infirm 90-something Russian father is the only thing keeping him from suicide. When he becomes aware that he has a tooth abscess - something that could easily kill him if left untreated - he decides to take his chances. He lives out the days that follow in anticipation of his fate.
