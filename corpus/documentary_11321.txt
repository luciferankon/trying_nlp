On Akhmeteli St. #4 in Tbilisi Georgia there stands a decrepit apartment house the director of this documentary once grew up in. After 10 years spent abroad he returns to capture the daily life of his neighbors on camera. The author quietly observes their private stories and examines how they are able to find happiness despite economical hardship and how they preserve their personalities and humor in spite of disillusion. Artistically the film is based on the house as a microcosm metaphorical of today's Georgian society.
