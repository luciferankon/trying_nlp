Planet Twelve: The Secret Lives of 12 year olds is a documentary that follows a group of 12 year olds through a week of school. It gives the viewers a view into a world we have forgotten. Something that becomes abundantly clear is how the adults int heir lives and many of us have forgotten that what seems insignificant to us is the entire world to a 12 year old. Planet Twelve should be seen by any adult who has school aged children...this humanizes our children and reminds us that their world is just a little smaller than ours.
