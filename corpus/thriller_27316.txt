On the outside the university is just an average college. However beneath its infrastructure hides a devious mob. This organization run by students filters drugs guns and other things throughout the campus. Mitch Cameron (Anders Amunson) is a mid-level hitman whose weekly schedule consists of cleaning up the mob's trash. The nature of his work has turned the college student into a quiet sullen man. That is until he meets Shawna (Rachel Tengwall). To him she is his way out; his salvation. Everything is smooth sailing until a new contract assigned to him by his boss complicates everything that he tried so hard to accomplish.
