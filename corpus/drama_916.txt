An unauthorised remake of Hitchcock's classic. The film is based on the same plot of Vertigo with some alterations most significantly the detective is prone to a heart attack instead of vertigo. Some changes are made in order to cope with the moral standard of the time and a certain elements of Chinese superstition are inserted to add an eerie mood of the story.
