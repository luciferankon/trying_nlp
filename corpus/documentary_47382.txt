Spec Ops takes viewers inside the greatest special operations in history - starting with the Son Tay Raid into North Vietnam. Led by legendary special forces veterans - this raid took a small group of men into the most heavily defended airspace in the world. Their target - a small prison compound on the outskirts of Hanoi. Their objective - to free the American POW's held there and bring them home. Or die in the attempt.
