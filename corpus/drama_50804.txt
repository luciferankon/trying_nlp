Maria tells her former colleague Hanna that she has undergone a cancer operation but is now cured. Soon after she suffers a relapse. The doctors believe that she should be told the truth about her condition and Hanna is willing to do so. For Maria it is the beginning of several long agonizing weeks until she is ready to accept that she has only a very small amount of time left to live. In the meantime Hanna has to decide how she can help her friend die; an almost unbearable decision but once made she carries it out to the last consequence.
