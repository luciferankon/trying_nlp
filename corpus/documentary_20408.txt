Todor Teokharov is an auditor of 30- year standing and untarnished reputation. He unearths evidence of rampant corruption among the administration in the district where he works. Nobody is being prosecuted in the wake of his certificates of audit. His efforts to receive the support of the state institutions end in a most unexpected way: he gets appointed in the capital city receiving a residence permit and a flat. Some of the culprits retire; others retain their high positions... The case has had a "happy" ending...
