Soviet proletarian film about anti-war strike at St Petersburg factory 1914. Resembles Pudovkin's classic "End of St. Petersburg" made 4 years earlier: backward lad (Poslavsky) from poor village comes to town desperate for work. He's hired as replacement (scab) worker at big metallurgical factory which is in the throes of a strike organized by the Bolsheviks (communists). The Bolshevik strikers are led by Ivan Shtraukh (brother of the more famous Russian actor Maxim Shtraukh). At first the deceitful industrialist's son (Fedosev) involves the naive Poslavsky in an attempt to murder Shtraukh but the attempt only wounds the heroic organizer. Will Poslavsky follow through with the planned killing or will he redeem himself by going over to the side of the strikers?
