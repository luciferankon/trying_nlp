Overland mail riders Jack Mason and his pal Porchy learn that an Indian uprising is imminent because one of the tribe has been murdered by a gang of outlaws. The primary town of the mail route is also being used as a hideout and base of operations for a gang of counterfeiters led by Joe Polini. Jack and an undercover federal agent Duke Evans round up the counterfeiters and turn Polini over to the Indian Chief as the killer of the brave.
