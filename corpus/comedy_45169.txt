Up Up Down Down: the series revolves around the misadventures of the employees and customers of UP UP DOWN DOWN a privately owned game store trying to keep itself open. The geeks are going to inherit the Earth but they need to get their act together first. It's Nerdvana but with more women. Full of fun and frivolity (I had to look it up too)
