A secret society has selected 14 juvenile convicts to compete in a tournament called "Omega One". The goal is simple survive the tournament and the winner regains their freedom with their records wiped clean. They are each given one completely random weapon to defend themselves from other competitors. They are then let loose on over 20 acres of land. However they are secured with magnetically plated boots and explosive tracking collars to keep them in line. The complication is that they are only given 48 hours to complete the tournament. If there are more than one players remaining at the end of the game all their collars will detonate. The battlefield is riddled with puzzles called "Death Traps" which if overcome will give the player an advanced weapon to compete with. If not the trap will bring about a violent and amusing death. But unknowingly to them the society is displaying this tournament to very wealthy investors from which they gamble on the lives of each convict.
