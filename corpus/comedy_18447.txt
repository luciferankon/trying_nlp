This short dark comedy follows a few days in the life of our favorite Nurse/Actress Tanya Brandt who gets caught in a psychotic entanglement with one of her homicidal patients. The film starts with a very dramatic "death montage soliloquy" a monologue patchwork of movie death scenes that lead to Tanya's drug overdose death. We fade to blackout & abruptly find that she is alive & well on-stage bowing before a full "Actor's Showcase" audience. We follow Tanya on her nursing rounds which take her into the exotic lifestyles of Hollywood's rich & famous. Tanya rattles on about her stellar performance of her "death montage soliloquy" & about her new agent Stan. Her career is about to take off! Then Tanya meets Marla her newest patient a "has-been" of '60s B-movie fame. Tanya's life starts to fall apart as Marla drives her into an out-of-control girl-on-girl pool fight-scene & a soap-opera death scene that may be a little too real. "Secrets of a Hollywood Nurse" is a tightly wound sinisterly humorous tale of the descent of an egocentric young nurse/actress into the depths of the insanity narcissism & deadly desperation of Hollywood.
