Dan Bell and Will Krupinsky take viewers on a tour of a creepy long-abandoned motel in one of America's blighted and economically hard-hit cities Pine Bluff Arkansas. This atmospheric and intense short film addition to Dan's Dead Motel Series not only shows a once vibrant motel in a state of serious rot but is the scene of a possible murder and definitely some criminal activity.
