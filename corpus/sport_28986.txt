Presented by World Champion Formula One Racing Driver Graham Hill. An accomplished amateur film maker Hill provided unique behind-the-scenes footage shot by himself at Monaco Le Mans Brand's Hatch etc as well as "at home" sequences with his family including his (then schoolboy) son Damon who himself became a champion racing driver. Greenwich Cable also shot scenes at the London Rowing Club on the River Thames where Graham Hill coached young rowers. Studio discussions with famous friends from the World of Sport were another feature of the show.
