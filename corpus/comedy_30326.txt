Be Real is the TV show that spontaneously turns regular people's ordinary lives into their very own reality TV show and it all happens on the spur of the moment. There's no script no pre-production not even a story idea. We choose a random person to star in their own life for a day... just their ordinary life... in front of a camera of course!
