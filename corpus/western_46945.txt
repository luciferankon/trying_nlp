The annual return of the salmon each year gives the Indians of the Northwest enough food to last until the next year. This way of live is threatened by Banning who puts in a cannery on the river to harvest the fish for sale. With the Canadian cannery on the other side the Indians find no fish in the river for them. But Banning wants all the fish for his business and he plans to burn the Canadian cannery and put the blame on Chief Nagora. But Indian Agent Roy knows that Nagora is being framed and starts looking for the people responsible with the help of his blood brother Dakota.
