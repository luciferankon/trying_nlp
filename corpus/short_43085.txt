Loosely inspired by actual events this film is partly a story of someone who feels that her world simply doesn't hold what she needs. It is also about the experiences children go through that aren't taken seriously by most adults (we prefer to think of children as essentially innocent and less complicated while ignoring the depth and complexity of their inner lives). It is also about putting the viewer through an experience similar to that of a person being forced to re-evaluate what they thought they knew about someone based on an unforeseen event. A ten year old girl is out of school for the summer and spends her time watching t.v. walking her dog and trying to get the attention of her mother. She is bored of having nothing to do she doesn't like her mom's new boyfriend and she tries to avoid the other kids in the neighborhood. These things are all true yet they can't begin to describe the girl's inner experiences - we can only observe her from the outside having our own reactions to events in her life while never really being able to know hers.
