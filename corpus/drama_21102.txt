ARJUN is an eye opener for Maharashtrian youth The revolution of united Maharashtra transforming culture and commercial development resulted in today's Maharashtra and Mumbai as financial capital. But where can we find Maharashtrian's identity in this capital city? THE THEME of the Movie is focused on a Maharashtrian youth who since ages carried the perception that they can only carry on with their humdrum jobs. Indulgence in business is next to impossible. This is drilled in his brain since childhood and as an adult he tends to behave in the same manner. As a matter of fact due to a complex blend of socio-cultural and political hegemony none of the domains have tried to pull the individual out of this maze. Arjun Pawar (The Hero) is an MBA degree holder struggling to have his own business and make his presence in the Business dominated community. Maharashtrian youth has always lagged behind whether in Mumbai or any part of Maharashtra . The Marathi youth has only dared to set up small business like VadaPav or fast food corners. Arjun is trying to step out of this maze establishing himself in the business world. Facing obstacles he goes on to reach his destinations after a painstaking struggle and efforts . He destroys the perception that Business is not the forte of the Maharashtrian Youth .
