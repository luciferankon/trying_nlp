This is the story of some of us of a bunch of people living isolated from the modern world who kept their minds clear and pure instead of anesthetizing them with daily TV trash overdoses. The characters of the story chose for a more natural style of life: they live in a town hung by the Ligurian Alps and their lives still depend on the mountains they are rooted into. A sense of relationship deeply involving these few souls who take care about this village preserving this cradle for a new born future.
