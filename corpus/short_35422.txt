This dark comedy resembles a Rounders meets The Devils Advocate situation. All in No Show Starling and Futura represent the most extreme players in the card game of Texas Hold'em. Their lives are turned upside down when the game takes an interesting twist and the stakes are raised to reel life assets instead of chips. The characters constant battle with each other and their addiction could lead them to literally put it all on the line.
