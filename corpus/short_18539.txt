Romulus is a fictional tale about an insomniac who only wakes at night. A narrated journal of one mans solitude and longing for a normal life in a twenty-four hour town all taking place in one night from dusk till dawn. Consumed by darkness he roams the urban void of the city in which he lives looking for life outside of his car window.
