Raised by wolves a ferine woman and last survivor of a cannibalistic tribe of inbred savages bathes wounded and vulnerable in a river somewhere in the lush woods of Northeast coast where she used to roam free. Stripped of clothes and anything that could tie her to the human race the human-like savage beast will seem as the perfect trophy to the eyes of Chris a misogynistic lawyer who will hunt the woman down and like the most precious and elusive prey he will manage to capture her and bring her home. However is there a place for a feral flesh-eating primitive who communicates with grunts and growls among civilised people? In the days to come Chris will make the woman his project and like a proud predator kept in captivity with the help of his dysfunctional family he will attempt to domesticate the untamed female by sadistically breaking her will. Soon enough though no restraints no training and certainly no male supremacy will be no match for the raging woman's raw and merciless punishment.
