PRIDE OF LIONS presents Sierra Leone in a new light - the story of what it means for a country and its people brutalized by an 11-year civil war to move beyond their scars. Through personal stories of human suffering loss and recovery the Sierra Leoneans reveal universal truths about the strength of the human spirit and the power of forgiveness to move us forward. The amputee the boy soldier the doctor the high school principal-each has a unique perspective and a powerful story to tell. Witnessing their ability to overcome inconceivable human atrocities and reclaim their legacy is inspirational for most but for the two Americans in our story it has been life changing.
