Short-lived sitcom which lived two lives once on NBC and again in syndication. Two Manhattan bachelors neat-freak attorney David Tucker and unkempt salesman Jay Bostwick decide to hire a housemaid. Enter Mickey Mackenzie a stunningly-beautiful 20s-something woman. Despite the fact Mickey (who usually wore T-shirts and jeans when not in various stages of undress) had no previous housekeeping experience David and Jay hire her on the spot. Jay's girlfriend Beth was a kindergarten teacher while David's girlfriend was Claudia. Claudia left early in the show's NBC run. When the show returned in syndication in 1987 Beth was gone too (her absence was not explained) but David Jay and Mickey gained new neighbors Max Papavasiolios Sr. and his son Max Jr. David Tucker is a lawyer who lives with sloppy importer and "idea-man" Jay Bostwick. Because of the mess in the apartment they hire Mickey McKenzie who appears to be a ditzy blonde as a housekeeper. Their girlfriends Claudia and Beth Sorenson are naturally suspicious. During the 1987-1988 season the show was syndicated. Claudia and Beth were gone replaced by Max Papavasilios Sr. a policeman and his awkward teenage son Max Jr.
