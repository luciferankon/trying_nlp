Paleontologist Bridget Drake (Kristina Michelle) is devoted to her work. In her search to find a new dinosaur species she uncovers something nobody knew existed... the remains of a dragon. But this isn't just any Dragon - this was the Mother of All Dragons. With the remains she finds a crystallized heart - the spirit of the dragon herself - and is visited by the dragon. Bridget is transformed into Lady Dragon and her mission is to put a stop to the evils in this world. In her search for Evil Lady Dragon uncovers the biggest source: Poppa Joe (Vernard Adams) a powerful Voodoo Priest; his army of the undead; and his princess Pandora (Annette Lawless). Lady Dragon must put this evil to rest while keeping the truth about who she really is a secret.
