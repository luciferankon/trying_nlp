The movie follows Rajai a Ford Transit driver which is the most popular transportation in the Palestinian occupied territories (occupied by Israel). While taking a ride with Rajai we experience the frustrating situation the Palestinian need to deal with. On our trips from the roadblock in Ramallah to the roadblock in Jerusalem we get to hear analysis of the situation by all kinds of random transporters people from different religions origins and levels of class.
