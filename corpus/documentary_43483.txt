Best of British follows comedian Nick Wilty on a tour of New Zealand and combines a look at the psyche of a comedian with a whistle-stop tour of the country where Nick doesn't just get to entertain the crowds but also swim with dolphins. Includes stage performances from both British and Kiwi comedians as well as an interview with British favorite Eddie Izzard.
