In the wee hours of December 20 1989....in the middle of NBC's live television coverage of America's invasion on Panama.....Tom Brokaw conducted two live telephone interviews with ROGER SIZEMORE an American businessman trapped in a hotel in Panama City. These conversations were so fascinating Brokaw and Bryant Gumbel interviewed him again merely hours later on the "Today' Show. Even more shocking and compelling a computer consultant named Brian Seifert soon claimed he was the voice of Sizemore who actually made the calls and invented this outlandish farce from his suburban home in Indianapolis.
