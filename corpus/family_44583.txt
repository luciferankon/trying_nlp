An extremely unusual and well-liked children's show starring Bill Jackson of "Clown Alley" fame. Each show was devoted to a "life lesson" like learning about responsibility fire safety etc. Jackson would also display his considerable artistic talents in particular during the segment where he would go find a lump of clay named "Blob" (an actual vocal character who mostly made strange mumbling noises) and shape him into something.
