More than 1000 years ago Vikings from Norway terrorized Europe; their legendary raids made their name synonymous with marauding pirates. Today this ruggedly beautiful country houses the Nobel Peace Center and stands one of the most eco-friendly countries on earth. How could such a progressive nation spring from such a violent past? Do Vikings represent a romantic revision of a grisly past or cynical pandering to a growing tourist trade? In his latest Adventures With Purpose special adventurer Richard Bangs seeks out the modern-day "Viking Spirit" in Norway's forbidding Arctic north its mountainous sea coast and its bustling cities. This documentary is the fifth edition to the Telly- and CINE Golden Eagle-winning series of specials which include Egypt: Quest for the Lord of the Nile  New Zealand: Quest for Kaitiakitanga  Switzerland: Quest for the Sublime and Morocco: Quest for the Kasbah .
