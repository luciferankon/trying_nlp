John and Ken have made a pact: They will either make a movie by the time they are 38 or they will put .38's to each other's heads count to 3 (or 38 - 'cuz it's like a theme) and pull the trigger. Using their friends neighbors and a "real Hollywood actor" they will set out to fulfill their life-long dream. Or perhaps beat it to death.
