Way Back When is an inspirational story of the adversity and challenge surfers go through while trying to make it to the world stage. The film traces the journey of a surfboard from the 1960s found washed up on a beach back to its creator Peter Way. Peter Way is a legendary surfer surfboard shaper and waterman who was the first winner of the New Zealand Surf Riding Championship in 1963 and had remarkable influence on the New Zealand surf scene for much of the 60s and 70s. While tracing the board's journey back from where it was found we hear personal stories from current Kiwi professional surfers and how Peter Way's influence helped them think big and achieve success. The film features the stories and surfing of professional surfers Maz Quinn Paige Hareb Billy Stairmand and Daniel Kereopa. Each of these surfers have faced similar struggles to what Peter Way faced and each have had mentors helping them along the way much the same as what Peter did for young surfers in the 60's. This cross over of new and old will weave together the paths of these individuals and their similarities to tell a gripping story of overcoming odds and making dreams come true.
