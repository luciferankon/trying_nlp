Zany situations and lapses of twisted logic make for a comedic romp when a free-spirited hippy couple (Mo and Ned) inadvertently show up a week late to attend the wedding of shallow suburbanites Roberto and Canada Montalban. Mo and Ned whose life motto is 'I don't know' live out of their VW bus which dies in front of the garish Montalban home. The two couples become instant neighbors as well as enemies. Mo and Ned are blamed for an unfortunate accident which causes Canada to get a black eye. This snowballs into a 'big thing' and they are evicted from their house (the VW bus) by the Montalbans.
