The series is the story of the band White Rabbit. From a fictional view a real band is born. Each episode releases a new song and at the end of each season an album and a live show. In a Rio de Janeiro that is not shown on a postcard lives the eccentric and misunderstood Lucas. This lonely character takes refuge through writing music. In this voracious struggle for recognition the band will face many obstacles - inflated egos envy cheating family drama short-term jobs and much more.
