This film is a visual poem; A melange of images that serves as an ode to parents that attempts to capture the feelings of the meaning they can hold for us while we grapple with the living knowledge of future loss. It is about coming to terms with who they are and their impact on the artist as individual. ----- About the Kobresia film series: Sometimes a word can take on a new meaning a personal meaning that transcends simplistic definition; something organic and not always easy to put into words. Kobresia is a genus of plants in the sedge family. Kobresia is also a music track by the Norwegian ambient electronic musician Geir Jenssen aka Biosphere. The song has had great impact on me and my approach to the work. For me "kobresia" has come to represent something layered organic sometimes nuanced subtle sometimes obvious but always something bound by the notion that the whole of a story is synergistic more than the sum of it's parts. Sometimes it is about a feeling or notion in it's pure state but not necessary something tidy. These films are experiments in abstract non-linear narrative and personal imagistic storytelling.
