Noted Playwright Otto Finch gets in over his head when on the strength of his reputation he is given the head writer position for a network sitcom. The problem...although he is a great Writer he knows absolutely nothing about comedy. However for pride and money Otto takes the job and instantly develops writer's block. While mulling over his dilemma Thalia the immortal and mythical "Muse of Comedy" appears to give him inspiration. Unfortunately she herself develops insecurities about her power. The two immediately become smitten and believe they could help solve each other's problems by having someone who knows nothing about comedy write a sitcom with someone who's not funny. All the while dealing with Otto's suspicious co-workers who would love to expose him as a no-talent hack Thalia's magical sisters (the other Muses) and at times perhaps even her father...Zeus.
