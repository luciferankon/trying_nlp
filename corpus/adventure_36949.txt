Very loosely based on a true story of Thai adventurer/photographer Joai Bangchark. After fleeing animal poachers Joai receives a necklace made of elephant tusk from a dying man in the forest. The necklace can apparently control the actions of elephants. Using the necklace he must thwart a band of evil animal poachers and save a local village with the help of the ghost of a baby elephant.
