Rabo de Peixe is a fishing village in the Azores. Between 1999 and 2001 Joaquim Pinto and Nuno Leonel shot a documentary there about the disappearing traditional fishing methods. The TV channel which commissioned the film didn't appreciate its critical attitude and broadcasted it only once in a shorter version. In the meantime the two directors move to the island and the industrial fishing methods supported by Community directives shake the small village. Fifteen years later they decide to re-edit the movie following their original intentions keeping in mind the time that has passed and how their lives have been changed by that place and its inhabitants.
