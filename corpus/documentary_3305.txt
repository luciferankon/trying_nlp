This piece divided into three segments each spotlighting the sword work of the three actors: Orlando Bloom (5:36) Keira Knightley (5:06) and Jack Davenport (5:16). In addition to those performers we hear from Bruckheimer Ruge Verbinski Arenberg and stunt doubles Lisa Hoyle and Thomas Dupont. We see their training and watch the filming of a few specific sword-intensive scenes.
