Class assignment: Write a 500-word essay on your hero. (1) Danny Connors dreams of being on-stage with gyrating rock idol Rick Donovan joining in on an imagined public performance (which later turns private). (2) In the school library Tony Wilde writes about his older brother Brandon who joined the navy. Missing him he imagines himself joining the navy to show his brother how much he's grown. Classmate Rob Daniels (enamored of Tony) sees the kid pleasuring himself and knows Tony's thinking of his absent brother again. He slips under the table to add actual sensations to Tony's imaged ones. (3) Star pitcher Steve Kolis's paper relays how he and buddy Jim Bentley got to meet professional baseball rookie Tim Kramer. What it doesn't say is that they caught the big athlete just after his shower and under Jim's initiative discover his distinct liking at swinging his bat for young male fans. (4) Mr. Taylor confronts Matt Sullivan about not turning in a paper only to discover that Matt is hot for teacher. Cole encourages full disclosure. As Matt and Cole explore their new dynamic Rydar Hanson walks in on them as does Lee Thompson later. All four join together later to discover their activities observed and enjoyed by yet another walk-in student Cliff Ryder.
