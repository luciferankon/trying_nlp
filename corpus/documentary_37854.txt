Truck Racer is the new TV documentary that explores one of the most bizarre sports known to mankind. We take you on board with truck racing brothers Graham and Steve Powell as they prepare for the ultimate race of the season at the British Truck Racing Championships. After an exciting summer with racing at top UK circuits plus the world famous Nurburgring we now see 25 teams compete at a rain soaked Brands Hatch as the Powells take on old hands Collett and Jenkins with plenty of drama involving the Dutch racing trio of Zandbergen Donk and rookie driver Henry Tijhuis who's here for his first ever race. Thrills and spills are guaranteed noise and smoke fill the air and rules are there to be broken as these world-class drivers battle it out.
