Estee Bruna Pedro is a fugitive fleeing a death sentence from the tyrannical government The Imperium for the crime of her existence. Estee has traversed the Westland Wastes in search of the reclusive hermit Boz Tony Hoff to enlist his services as a guide out of the territories controlled by the Imperium. Boz refuses to act as her guide but offers her a place to rest and whatever help he may provide. Their uneasy alliance is tested the following morning when a Legion hunting party led by Centurion Markus Owen Martin comes looking for Estee. Estee then must convince Boz to help her escape the Legionaries.
