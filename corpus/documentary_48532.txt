The Payatas dump site tragedy happened on July 10 2000 in the Philippines. At 8:05am. A massive 50ft wall of solid waste slides down and buries hundreds of shanties and an undetermined number of people. This is not just the story of what happened that day but more about the prevalent internal and external migration that occurs in almost all underdeveloped countries like the Philippines.
