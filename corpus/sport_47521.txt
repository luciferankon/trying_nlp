XFL LLC was a professional American football league operated as the XFL founded by World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) owner Vince McMahon. With eight teams (all fully owned by the league corporation) in two divisions it was intended to be a major professional sports league complement to the off-season of the National Football League but was unable to find an audience and ceased operation after its debut season in 2001.The XFL was widely ridiculed; McMahon conceded that the league was a "colossal failure".
