American TV producer Dale Hurd comes to Slovenia 20 years after its independence from Yugoslavia. He wants to investigate the case of Erased and meets two Bosnian Muslims - Irfan and Nisveta. They changed their cultural identity after the independence of Slovenia and tried to assimilate their new culture. Nisveta converts from Islam to Christianity and becomes an important member of the Baptist Church in Ljubljana (she sings in the church choir). On the other hand Irfan continues to live in past times of Yugoslav communism. He becomes a member of Youth Work Brigades Club in Ljubljana. "Slovenia My Homeland" is a film about rootlessness and a people's need to belong to its society.
