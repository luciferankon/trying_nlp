A famous movie star and mother of two children who have no self-estimation has organized an evening in her luxurious home to celebrate her latest film. The evening highlights the different aspects often unpleasant of the relationship among the guests. A little symbolic insight somewhat unforgiving into the world of showbusiness seen as a repository of hypocrisy envy and jealousy. An ensemble film closed in time and space with the intention of playing with languages and cultures.
