Our documentary explores the lives of a handful of Clarkston GA residents many of whom are refugees and immigrants who are working towards starting their own small businesses. Follow the incredible and inspiring journey of this talented group as they face the challenges and struggles that come with being entrepreneurs. With most small businesses facing the harsh reality of a less than 50% success rate our entrepreneurs have overcome language barriers cultural differences and socio economic conditions to redefine their destiny and achieve their insatiable goals. This is the story of a 12-week program hosted by Emory's Goizueta School of Business where over sixty applicants are filtered down to 15 finalists; the top three walking away with $10000 loans. You will get to know our entrepreneurs and understand why they work to overcome the odds despite a past life filled with many hardships. It is this type of intrinsic character that will hopefully set these unique business men and women apart from their peers and make a huge impact on the community they now call home.
