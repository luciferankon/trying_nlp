Pipes of Peace interweaves a rare intimate interview with Rufus Harley in his home along with insights and memories from family members friends and many great musicians. Harley crossed over into the rock-pop and hip-hop community guesting on diverse recordings with Laurie Anderson and The Roots. We explore his struggle success philosophy and his influential jazz bagpipe playing in his community the nation and throughout the world. Rufus often handed out miniatures of the Liberty Bell & copies of the U.S. Constitution during his tours abroad. Harley's message of sustaining peace for all cultures is as relevant today as his message was in the 60's and 70's.
