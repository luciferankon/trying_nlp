Ready for a battle waged via shofar? After the Midianites took over the Israelites turned back to G-d. More than 22000 soldiers volunteered to fight the Midianites but with the strength of G-d Gideon only needed 300. So he tested the soldiers to drink from nearby waters and chose only those who lapped the water. By doing little more than triumphantly blowing their shofars and banging wildly on pottery Gideon and his truncated crew experienced a miracle and drove away the Midianites.
