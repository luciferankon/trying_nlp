The Priestess Walks Alone is a journey our journey. As a priestess through chants and prayers during the "Soul Guiding" ceremony my mom helps the dead achieve salvation but she is bound to her painful past unable to free herself. As a filmmaker using images and sounds that unfold on the screen I tell stories for the voiceless yet I'm muted by a shameful secret afraid to reveal the truth. In different mediums caught between the living and the dead as the past and present collide my mom and I embark on a journey attempting to find our salvation.
