In Rio de Janeiro ten young people coming from socioeconomic environments as opposed as the wealthy neighborhood of GÃ¡vea and the favela Rocinha are to make a documentary of their own creation. The young participants decide to use the resources and knowledge facilitated by the Big Tree Collective to cinematically explore the socio-spatial segregation of the environment that they share on their daily lives. The film unveils the personal stories of the inhabitants of one and the other side of the mountain while reflecting on the creation of a youth-based documentary narrative. An experimental film that brings to the screen a creative testimony that reveals the vacuum of stereotypes offering new attitudes and perspectives that foresee a better future for both communities and the city.
