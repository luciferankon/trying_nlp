In the Company of Joan is a feature documentary about the life and work of Joan Littlewood who opened a door in British Theatre to working class actors and audiences alike. It hears from and about some of those who worked in Joan's company from the early touring years right through to her time at Theatre Royal Stratford East in London's East End. It includes those involved in her work with the wider community beyond the walls of the theatre and it hears from those who never met her but have been inspired or enabled in their own careers by what she and her Theatre Workshop achieved. It is part of a trilogy of films which explore sometimes hidden aspects of the legacy of Ms Littlewood.
