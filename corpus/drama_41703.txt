Daniel Mitchell is a typical 13 year-old boy - mad about space'The X Files' and Pamela Anderson. Bright capable of looking after himself streetwise he's the last person you'd expect to become a victim of bullying. But after he comes to the aid of a victimized school-friend Daniel becomes the target of systematic ruthless and destructive abuse. It starts as a personal battle between Daniel and his teenage aggressors - but it soon becomes clear that it's aided and abetted by the very people Daniel might rely upon to help - the teachers.
