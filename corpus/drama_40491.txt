Even you consider yourself a Loser at this point in your life and it sucks. You are living at home with your dad after graduating from college. Even though you now have a college degree the world is not exactly beating your door down with job offers. Then your dad tells you that unless you get a job in a month you are out on your ass. Feeling a little pressured? And it seems like the whole deck is stacked against you: Your best friend is nuts and you don't even have a girlfriend to comfort you during these bad times. You also have a deep secret something you have never told anyone that gives you nightmares. The Only thing going for you is your movie collection which has thousands of films in it. What the hell are you going to do? Larry Wilson didn't know either. So he opened up a business in his living room called "Larry's Home Video."
