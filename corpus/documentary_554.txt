On the Island of Kaui... where the road ends... a trail begins. The mystic trail winds for 11 miles on the edge of a cliff. The destination is an enchanted hidden valley called "Kalalau". Some try to find this place to lose there past. Some try to find themselves in this island paradise. Others who walk this trail are to never be seen again.
