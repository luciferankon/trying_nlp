Charles "DOC" Broadus was born in 1919 in Raleigh North Carolina. He was a grandson of a slave and was an adolescent moonshine runner. As a teenager he boxed in a summer camp with Joe Louis. Joe told him once:" Young man you must pursue the art of boxing you will be a great one day". And so he did. After a 100-0 record as an amateur he went on to become a professional where he suffered his first loss at 22 wins. At once he retired and became a trainer where Doc went on to become arguably one of the greatest trainers who has ever lived. After serving in two wars he discovered a young George Foreman. Together they went to the Olympics and achieved Gold. However in his later years those who he helped reach the top left him behind and Doc was left destitute in Las Vegas where he continued to help and teach young fighters until the day he passed away. Doc will be forever remembered training some of the greatest from Foreman to Sugar Ray Leonard he was truly a Legend.
