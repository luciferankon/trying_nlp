Hot Money is a story of deceit and debacle. Simran (Nilanjana Bhattacharya) cries rape against her teacher Rahul Kapoor (Tarun Arora). To make her case stronger she asks an ex-student Tanya (Divya Dwivedi) to testify in court against Rahul. However Simran's bluff is out and it then emerges that Simran Rahul and Tanya were all hand-in-glove to make money from Simran's rich mother (Kunika). A police inspector Arjun Chowdhary (Mukesh Tiwari) gets wind of the trio's deal and tries to get a share of the pie. Meanwhile Simran murders Tanya; Arjun kills Simran; and Rahul and Arjun also die in the end. Sunita Sanyal (Rati Agnihotri) and Mahajan (Tinnu Anand) play lawyers.
