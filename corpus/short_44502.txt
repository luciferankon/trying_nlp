Stanton Powell left town 6 years ago without telling his family or his business partners. Now there is a rumor that he might be back in town and the lives he affected once more get stirred as we see what comes of family friends and former business associates when you steal and lie and disappear only to try to come back and see what has happened while you are away. Are some wounds beyond repair?
