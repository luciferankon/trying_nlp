An old soldier enters at night a destroyed theater. From the ruins his memories of a long gone life that the war has taken away resurface: a career as an orchestra conductor and love. But a chest has looked after his old tuxedo. The soldier takes off his uniform to wear the tuxedo and to direct his last Opera in the ruins. At the sound of an overture the theater is reconstructed back to its splendor while his love comes back to pick him up and accompany him beyond earthly life.
