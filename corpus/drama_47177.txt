To Cherish the Sea is a "slice-of-life" drama. It tells the story of two very modern true characters: Hannah a young French woman and a Syrian man who are instantly identifiable and real. Hannah came from France "running away" from her own will Homs came from Syria against his. They meet in Beirut in an apartment where they have to coexist in a city where they are both strangers alone and coping with traumas. They are both stepping into adulthood in times of wars globalization and violence of the world. They are also both individuals who have their own life and trivial problems. One's destruction and violence is concrete the other's seems to be figurative lingering. Their "pain of the world" is different but the course of their lives brought Hannah and Homs to the same place at the same time. During the time of their stay they become windows to each other's world and understand that their pains although different are both legitimate. Beirut the city of exiles is a platform stop for them. There in a bubble of their own they end up giving each other a break of hope and oxygen. The unaffected "bigger world" of today becomes more human by materializing itself in the encounter of the two simple human beings two small worlds in the middle of the 7 billions existing ones.
