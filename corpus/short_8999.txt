Starting where _The Sid Saga Part 2 (1987)_ (qv) leaves off 'Sid Laverents' (qv) concludes the telling of his life story to present day. It's now 1945 and Sid has been discharged from the army air corp. He had no intention of going back to work for Consolidated in San Diego but after a business venture to work in plastics fell through he decided to go back to his old job now increasingly in the field of aeronautic engineering. He also began inventing as a hobby and started to raise chinchillas as a side venture. The transition back to married life was the most difficult. After some suspicions Sid with a witness in hand caught wife Stella in bed with another man which allowed him to file for divorce. Although being a bit gun shy after two failed marriages he decided that the third time might be the charm which it was with third wife 'Adelaide Laverents' (qv). By the late 1950s he would become interested in movie making and ended up making a series of amateur films both education documentaries and fictional tales which would win many awards. The most notable is _Multiple SIDosis (1970)_ (qv). Filmmaking would become a larger part of his life with the engineering jobs coming and going with the start and end of contract for larger projects.
