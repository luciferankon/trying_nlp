Mordred is a dark Arthurian drama telling the legends from the point of view of Arthur's much vilified illegitimate son set in the 6th Century drawing heavily from very early sources including the Annales Cambriae the Welsh Triads the Mabinogion and local legends in Devon & Cornwall as well as more recent medieval sources. This drama is set in the 530s against the backdrop of the Saxon invasions heavily influenced by Celtic legends Druidic traditions and the earliest tales of Arthur and his followers.
