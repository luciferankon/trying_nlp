Tom Schlub is one day away from taking the bar exam (his fourth and last chance) when his overbearing wife leads him onto a murder scene. Now he must get rid of the body or face serious criminal charges -- on a night when he should be home studying. Tom gets assistance from Joe a strange plumber who is quick to spout philosophy and quote Shakespeare. Joe even has a bizarre solution about how Tom can pass the bar but his help comes at a cost.
