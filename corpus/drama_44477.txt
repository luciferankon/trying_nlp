Very loosely based on Anton Chekov's the Cherry Orchard the film follows a family of formerly wealthy expatriate Sri Lankan landowners now impoverished as they return from England to the magnificent country estate they left behind. A deeply moving study of a caste and a country torn apart by social change.
