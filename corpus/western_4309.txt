Ben Wallace is after Don Aliso's rancho. After falsifying his land survey he frames him for murder. But Wallace has a dull-witted accomplice in Rance Potter and this is who Wade Barton thinks he can trick into a confession. Wade Barton ('George O'Brien' (qv)) leads a band of riders who hire out to stagecoach companies or anybody else with trouble that needs honest settlement. He rescues Anita del Campo ('Lupita Tovar' (qv)) and a shipment of gold from a gang of bandits. Ben Wallace ('William Royle' (qv)) Rance Potter ('Glenn Strange (I)' (qv)) and John Courtney ('LeRoy Mason' (qv)) have a scheme going to take his ranchero from Don Aliso del Campo ('Lucio Villegas' (qv)) and Barton and his riders take up the fight.
