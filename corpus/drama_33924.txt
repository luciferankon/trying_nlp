This Genghis Khan movie will bring to life the savage barbarian we've only read about. Genghis Khan formed the Mongol Empire by unifying many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia. Considered a genocidal ruler Genghis Khan concurred most of Eurasia and reigned this largest empire in history from 1206 to 1227. After 800 years still today Mongolians regard Genghis Khan as their founding father.
