The New Level is a fake late night talk show/sketch comedy/comedic soap opera with a sitcom feel to it where anything and I mean anything can happen. Storylines character dynamics and rivalries carry over each episode. The New Level was hosted by Scott Freakin Vogel "The V O G in season 1 but he was fired for being too fat and is shown thru out the 2nd season working out with personal trainers to get his job back. Season 2 is hosted by "The Chosen One" Jackson Fox. The ongoing storyline in season 2 is the evil Network led by Producer Tyler Monroe and Superstar Actors who mainly care about money and insult the audience every chance they get - battling against the Fan Favorites who care about entertaining the fans led by Actor Gary Jones....We're taking sketch comedy and late night talk shows to a whole New Level and there ain't a damn thing Hollywood can do about it- Oh Yeah!
