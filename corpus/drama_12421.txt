Dying for the Other is a video triptych documenting the lives of mice used in breast cancer research and humans suffering from the same disease. In order to produce this video da Costa documented scenes of her own life during the summer of 2011 and combined them with footage taken at a breast cancer research facility in New York City over the same time frame. Dying for the Other is designed for three separate screens and should not be shown as a single screen projection. The submitted DVD is for demonstration purposes only.
