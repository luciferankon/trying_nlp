The Sasquatch Hunters is a mockumentary following a number of unusual characters as they search for and obsess over Bigfoot. We meet several groups: The Bigfoot Society a cell of true believers; the American Hominid Association (AHA) a government funded band of trackers; and the Michigan Cryptozoological Institute a cult-like organization devoted to welcoming the Sasquatch-American into western society. These and other characters cross paths and eventually converge at an impromptu festival dubbed "Bigfoot Bonanza".
