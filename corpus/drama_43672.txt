Mere Gunaah an emotional drama where the story gives a moral and reality...its about young generation who are running to get fame money and all materialistic things but forget to spend time with the family .At the end of this life the truth is only that relations are our real bank balance these are our property and our happiness...Life is beautiful when soul get relax. Why we are running so fast? Why we are following something which is invisible? Proximity only comes when we know truth of this life which is relation once we lost we shall never get back again....
