This is not a dramatization. It is the true story with real historical footage of how all sectors of NASA--including astronauts in the Apollo 13 spacecraft as well as backup astronauts on the ground electrical and environmental and computer engineers and flight and simulations directors--and even employees of aerospace companies such as Boeing who made components used in the mission--were able to overcome an unforeseen and catastrophic explosion of one of 2 oxygen tanks in the service module due to a short circuit that also ripped open the other oxygen tank. Despite years of intense and comprehensive simulations of possible malfunctions this extreme failure of oxygen storage and the electrical system seemed at first to signal impending death for the 3 astronauts. By moving into the Lunar module shutting down most normal functions and a variety of ingenious technical fixes originating from the combined mental and computational power of thousands of NASA and other staff these astronauts were barely able to make a safe landing back on Earth before running out of oxygen and freezing to death.
