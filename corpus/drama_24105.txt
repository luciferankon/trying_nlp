In fourteenth-century England peasant girl Christine Carpenter is so attracted to a statue of the Virgin Mary that the local priest (who lusts after her) suggests she be walled up in the church as an anchoress a holy woman with responsibility for blessing the villagers. But when the priest has Christine's mother tried as a witch she digs herself out of her cell a crime for which the punishment is death... Enter the medieval world of Christine Carpenter a visionary girl who is to become an Anchoress (walled-in recluse) so that she can "live in the Virgin's house forever." Based on actual letters that were written about such an Anchoress in 1325 the film follows Christine as she awakens to her own sensuality and explores her own female earth-based spirituality.
