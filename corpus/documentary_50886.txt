In recent years Manitoba has received more refugees than any other province in Canada. Hospitality House run by Karin Gordon and Tom Denton have rescued (privately sponsored) more refugees than any other agency or group in Canada. Last year they helped over 1300 refugees come to Canada via private sponsorship. And Karin and Tom are both aging; Karin is over 70 and Tom is in his early 80's. While We Can - The Road to Rescue intertwines a range of refugee stories focusing on some who walked many miles to freedom with the impressive work of Hospitality House. Karin Gordon has also been the one called by Canadian Customs border agents when refugee claimants have managed to walk into Canada. She has personally taken some of them in fed them clothed them and assisted them as they apply for formal refugee status.
