This scripted Urban Comedy series is about an over-bearing Mother and her Son who longs for independence as they try to find common ground to his inevitable departure from the nest. Things get hilariously disastrous as the series demonstrates the enormous difficulties many parents face having to let their children grow up no matter what the age.
