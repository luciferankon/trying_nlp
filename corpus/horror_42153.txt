Millionaire playboy Hugo (whose lack of facial expressions give him the appearance of a Thundercat marionette) flies around Acapulco in his private helicopter to pick up sexy young women. He whisks them away to his secluded old castle where he wines and dines them (among other things *wink*). With the aid of his bald mute little helper Gorgo he kills his dates keeping their heads in a crystal cage and feeding their chopped up body parts to his 1000-strong army of blood thirty flesh hungry cats.
