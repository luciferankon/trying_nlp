My Roommate's an Escort is an original comedy series created by and starring Trish Rainone and Katie Uhlmann. It's slated for release in 2017. It's an off-kilter comedy about two polar opposite roommates who influence each other's lives for better or worse. As small-town girl Heather gets to know her new street-wise roommate Kesha she starts to suspect Kesha may be an escort because of her dubious and sketchy behaviour. However Heather is non-confrontational in the extreme and her inability to address a series of Kesha's red-flag moments leads to the hilarious unraveling of Heather's life.
