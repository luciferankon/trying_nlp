Masterfully edited from nearly 200 hours of footage PAPIROSEN represents a decade of filmmaking and four generations of Argentine director Gast√≥n Solnicki's family history culled from 8mm home videos a VHS bar mitzvah and original observational material. His father Victor emerges as the lead figure but Solnicki highlights the entire clan. Beginning with the birth of his nephew Mateo and punctuated throughout by interviews with his grandmother Pola a Holocaust survivor the film's scope is simultaneously epic and intimate. PAPIROSEN is a meditation on family history the importance of storytelling and the power of cinema itself. OFFICIAL SELECTION - New York Jewish Film Festival
