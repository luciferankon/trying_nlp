A rigged professional fist-fighting tournament 20 years ago led to the downfall of one family and changed the course of both families forever. The patriarchs of the Tuan and Yeh families faced each other in an epic professional fist-fighting tournament that went horribly wrong and the two families have been sworn enemies ever since. Tuan Yu-Chiao ('Tony Sun (III)' (qv)) is the son of one of the feuding families who also is an expert fist fighter as well as heir to the family's successful entertainment company.
