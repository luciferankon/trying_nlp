Full of sex and fury east is a sharp affectionate and funny expose of life in London's East End. With its uncompromising physical performance style and its rich poetic language veering from Shakespearean parody to the shatteringly profane it is a rollercoaster of gripping theatricality teeming with both visual and verbal exuberance. Steven Berkoff directs a superb ensemble company in the 25th Anniversary production filmed during its sell-out run at the Vaudeville Theatre in London's West End.
