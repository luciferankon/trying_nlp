This two-disk set was filmed live at the (soon to be famous) Flying Saucers Caf√© in Santa Monica California. Michael inaugerated his new interactive format where he takes questions - and challenges - from the audience instead of presenting lectures such as are available in the Meier Case Update series featured below. This presentation is the first in a series of presentations Michael is scheduled to make at the cafe. Some of the questions that Michael gives in-depth answers to in this - non-stop two hours and forty minutes - new series are: ? Why has the Meier case been suppressed by the powers that be? ? Where can we find documentation of the publication of the prophecies and predictions? ? What kind of intervention can we expect from the Plejaren in light of the critical conditions we now face? ? Who were the gods of the past in the various religions? ? What do the Plejaren say about Obama? ? What's the truth about skeptics who now claim to have duplicated Meier's photos and films? ? How does reincarnation work if you were an extraterrestrial in a distant past life who came here? ? How and why did we need seven prophets to bring the spiritual teaching to us? ? Why didn't the Plejaren offer of contact with the Jimmy Carter administration in 1979 succeed? ? What's the truth about the Roswell androids secret military craft the UFO cover-up? ? How does demonizing "aliens" connect to corporate and governmental plans for gaining complete control over humanity including bio-chipping? ? Were or are there any other authentic contactees? ? What about official "Disclosure"? ? What are the latest prophecies and predictions? ...and many many many more in the first of this fascinating new series. NOTE: This is the same cafe at which Michael also made his groundbreaking public announcement about his own personal evidence that the Meier case is authentic.
