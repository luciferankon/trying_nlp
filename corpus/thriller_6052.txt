This Short film is about 5 friends who decide to go on a stress free no cell phones getaway hiking & camping trip in the woods. They soon find out about the legend of a little girl named Gretchen who was murdered almost a century ago and is said to be roaming the woods screaming out for her mother at night. Is it true or is it just a old folk tale created to scare and deter campers from entering Gretchen's Lock?
