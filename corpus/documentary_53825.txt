Last Saturday Hannover-Linden presented his multicultural side and offered a varied program with a participatory character in the foreground. And there were plenty of reasons to celebrate: - 150 Years "Young Linden" - 50 years "Freizeitheim Linden" - 40 years "IGS Linden" - 30 years "DGB-Choir" - 20 years of "Faust" and - 10 years "IG Ahrbergviertel".
