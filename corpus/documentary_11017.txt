Until recently Brazil was one of the shooting-stars of the BRIC states. But after a decade of economic growth the social cement began to crumble. Many people can no longer see a better future in the credit-based boom of the past years. One year before the World Cup and three years before the Olympics came the big bang. The biggest mass movement in decades emerged after the costs for public transportation rose in June 2013. Inspired by that insurrection social struggles are now spreading like woldfire: workers going on wildcat strikes young women mobilizing against the visit of the Pope people fighting against urbanization projects. And in many favelas resistance against militarization and displacement is on the rise. "We are not samba dancers" say the striking garbage workers known as "Garis" in one interview. "We are rebels". They and other rebels tell their story in this documentary: We don't like Samba.
