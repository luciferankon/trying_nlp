A study of sexual fluidity as captured through the lens of film history. Comprised of clips from nine films from Golden Age of Hollywood and the independent avant gard Self and Others is a formal experiment with queer visual language. On the tenth anniversary of the publication of the inflammatory and phobic editorial "Gay Straight or Lying?" in The New York Times in 2005 Self and Others is formal study of some of the earliest modern visual signs of sexually fluid cultures and its complex structure for recognition.
