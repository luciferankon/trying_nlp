A group of British men or women are taken to a remote uninhabited Pacific island by 'Bear Grylls' (qv) and left completely alone for six weeks with nothing but cameras the clothes they're wearing and some basic tools. 'The Island with Bear Grylls' is a reality TV show in which 'Bear Grylls' (qv) takes a group of British men and women and leaves them stranded on a tropical island in the pacific ocean with nothing but the clothes they stand in and a small amount of survival gear. The idea behind the show is to see if the 21st century British man or woman can go back to humanities hunter/gatherer origins and survive in the most difficult of situations. The Islanders have 2 days of survival training prior to their departure and then once dropped off on the island they must find ways to collect fresh water and make it drinkable catch and kill their own food and survive their duration on the island. So far there have been two series. In the first 13 British men were left on an island for 4 weeks. In the 2nd series 14 British men were left on one island while 14 British women were left on another island for 6 weeks in the middle of tropical storm season to see who would fare better.
