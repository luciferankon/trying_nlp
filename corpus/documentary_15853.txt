Now in their fifties the two find themselves in the midst of a debate dividing their community and the world: who controls consumes and benefits from our planet's shrinking supply of natural resources? While Beverly organizes her neighbors and leads a legal fight to stop Miller Brothers Coal Company from advancing into her hollow Terry considers signing away the mining rights to his backyard-a decision that could destroy not only the two friends' homes but the peace and environment surrounding their community. The two friends soon find themselves caught in the middle. of a contentious battle over energy and the wealth and environmental destruction it represents.

As the world's population soars humankind must mine the earth's natural resources to feed our voracious appetite for energy fighting wars over diminishing supplies of water oil and coal. But it is not only the earth itself that is rapidly changing and disappearing: as we excavate resources in ever-expanding areas small communities are being flattened taking with them our world's diverse cultures traditions and lives. Through a complex human story that cuts across environment economics public policy and culture the story of Beverly May and Terry Ratliff reveals the devastating impact of our energy consumption against an explosive backdrop: Appalachia's centuries-old struggle over the black rock that fuels our planet.
