The story follows Imi Stoglin and Blaze as they adventure through a magical love story full of farriers Werewolves Shape Shifters Vampires and Witches. Imi is a young girl that wakes up one day not knowing where-and more importantly who-she is at least not until after she was surveying her father's library and uncovers the ancient book and a collection of yellowing letters. Imi (Imara Stoglin) is a Dhampiretwich (human vampire witch) that can see the future change things with her mind posse's magical powers and controls the elements. Imi is not aware that she in reality is a Dhampiretwich all she knows for sure is that her family is strange and getting stranger by the seconds.
