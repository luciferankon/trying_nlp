Margaret Wyndham Chase wants to run for governor and approaches Eddie Ace local political kingmaker/fringe gangster to get his support. Ace's belief is that "beautiful women and politics do not mix" and he declines to help. She decides to play the game rough-and-tough without him but he shows he is even rougher-and-tougher and she gives up and withdraws from the race. But Ace has fallen in love with her at about the 45-minute mark and with his new-found ardor for clean politics he makes some (unclean) manipulations behind the scenes and she is picked to run on an independent good-government ticket.
