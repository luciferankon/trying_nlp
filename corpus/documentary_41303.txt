The name of Savely Kramarov was legendary during his lifetime. When he emigrated from Russia to the USA it turned out that his name... no longer officially existed. Soviet apparatchiks attempted to make millions of Kramarov's fans forget their idol and worse they filled newspapers with stories full of lies and insinuations. That is how a disgraceful article entitled "Savely in blue jeans" was published in a major Soviet newspaper. A decade later however Kramarov returned to his homeland. He starred in several new films and promised to visit more frequently. Then unexpectedly he passed away. The film includes interviews with many of Kramarov's colleagues and close friends such as Paul Mazursky Elya Baskin Oleg Vidov Tatiana Sorokko and others.
