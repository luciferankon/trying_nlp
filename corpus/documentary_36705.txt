We are proud to introduce 'Ceremony For This Time' a new documentary film that highlights the potency of an arts education using Montclairs' own Glenfield Middle School as the landscape. We traced students from 20 years ago to present day and we see how creativity manifests meaningful connections. The proof is evident a performing arts education fosters fluency between each discipline. This multidimensionality builds confidence in the students that goes beyond the walls of this school. It serves them in the purpose of their lives.
