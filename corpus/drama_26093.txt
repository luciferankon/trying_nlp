Sgt. King of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is in charge of the detachment in Keeway and he takes an interest in a new arrival who has registered at the local hotel as Helen Curtis. Her real name is Lawton and King is soon onto her real identity. She's returned to Keeway under a false name to lay claim to her father's share of a valuable mining property. He died when she was just a baby but her lawyer Frank Becker thinks she is entitled to half of Henry Dundas' extensive mining operation. He's not a very scrupulous lawyer however and has his own plans.
