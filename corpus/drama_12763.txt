After Sam a penniless Afro-German singer discovers he's HIV positive he gets utterly drunk spends a few miserable days but promptly falls (back) in love. Amidst a crumbling former East Berlin (its bulidings cars people & culture) Sam develops a "family" for the new millenium for the new generation of post-drug cocktail AIDS victims. The fragile "family" he forms includes his on-again-off-again boyfriend Rainer and his best friend Bastl with his latest fling Mike. Like the old schmaltzy East German songs which Sam is recording the sweet innocence of the characters struggle to prevail the misfortunes of the characters nothwithstanding. In a touching tale set in the intoxicating underground of contemporary East Berlin Sam an Afro-German lives in a crumbling once-grand apartment. Here time blissfully ceases to exist news of a photo sold and an ex-lover dead are equal reasons to celebrate and a trip to the seashore seems the natural solution to all of life's looming problems. Like the schmaltzy old East German love songs that Sam is recording for his new CD Sam and his friends rise to the top in spite of various misfortunes not the least of which is HIV/AIDS. Careers stagnate savings evaporate and tragedy strikes but somehow their lives are still victorious.
