'Why Quilts Matter: History Art & Politics' a nine-part documentary series explores what some say is the largest mass movement people don't know exist - more than 21 million quilters are currently active in the US. The documentary reveals the influence quilts have today a four billion dollar economic impact annually and talks about the important role quilts have played over the last two centuries when quilting was one of the few ways women could convey political views record their personal stories and express their artistic sides. The documentary tackles tough topics including what criteria should be used to define art and if quilting has been held back in the art world because of its female origins and utilitarian nature. It also takes on the politics within the quilting world from competing quilt associations to the use of machines and technology to whether the quilts of Gee's Bend with their stains sometimes imperfect stitching and unique designs are museum-worthy.
