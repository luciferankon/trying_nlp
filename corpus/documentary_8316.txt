Sadie Kaye produces and presents a frank and irreverent sequel to her 2015 documentary for RTHK 'The Bipolar Express'. This time her focus is shining a spotlight on the lives of an eclectic mix of artists and professionals who secretly/ openly struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Guests include comedians Mat Ricardo and John Richardson poet Neil Hilborn artist Charlotte Farhan writer Timothy Wong and psychiatrist Dr. Barry Connell. There's also a comedic turn from actor Philippe Joly and the specter of Jack Nicholson in 'As Good As It Gets'. The 30-minute doc cheekily titled 'As Bad As It Gets' broadcasts on Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) in the fall/ autumn.
