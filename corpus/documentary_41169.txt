Fuelled by a boom both in natural resources (such as oil natural gas and minerals) and service industries (such as media finance and telecommunications) Nigeria has now become the largest and wealthiest economy in Africa. Many of the young entrepreneurial members of Nigeria's new "Super-Rich" have strong links to the UK and an increasing number are drawn to live and work in London. This documentary follows the lives of some of these members of the Nigerian elite who come to Britain and spend big on property education and luxuries including two heiresses to a $1.2 billion fortune and a multi-millionaire preparing to launch a new business venture in London.
