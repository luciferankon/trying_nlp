While the program had its first national broadcast in 1957 it actually started as a local music show playing out of Philadelphia in 1952 technically making 2002 its fiftieth anniversary. This TV special hosted by Dick Clark takes a look back at some of the great performers (and a few who disappeared as quickly as they came) who got their starts on the show.
