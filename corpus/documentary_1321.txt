This fascinating region was set apart as a Government Reservation to be known as Yellowstone Park in 1S72. The park proper is about 62 miles long from north to south and 54 miles wide. While the tourist may reach the park entrance by rail it has been decreed by Uncle Sam that beyond the Great Lava Arch Gateway the iron horse shall not trespass. So here leaving the pathway of steel we take our place on one of the six-horse coaches that run from Gardiner up to Mammoth Hot Springs. Coaching Troops Morris Basin Great Fountain Pack mules Riverside Geyser Old Faithful Deer and Bear Upper Falls Canyon Field Glasses. Standing on a balcony at Artist's Point we take up the field glass to have a tele-photo panorama of these weird walls with their clinging pine trees. We look down the Great Gorge. On either side walls of exquisite color rise with here and there pinnacle-like great church spires. Above our heads fly eagles who build their nests and raise their young on the top of these lofty peaks. The scene is a powerful one and beyond words but the Great Falls add force and quality of action which tempers and dignities the whole scene. This enormous volume of water that looks like a curtain of lace tumbles over a cliff of volcanic rock 310 feet. Here the traveler finds himself spellbound held by the pure beauty of the scene. In turning away he pauses to marvel at the wonders of nature and the beauties of our great national playground.
