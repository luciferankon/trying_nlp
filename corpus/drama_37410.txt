Office clerk Eero Koskinen prefers to spend his nights drinking and reminiscing the war with his friends instead of taking care of his wife and two children. A two-week drinking spree gets him fired and a new job is not easy to find because of his reputation. He goes to a rehab centre in the countryside for a couple of weeks but with no permanent result. Meanwhile his wife has to get a job and is employed by her old sweetheart now a recently divorced successful businessman.
