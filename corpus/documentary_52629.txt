The Power of Place explores the places issues and people affected by Northern Pass a proposed 180-mile long electricity transmission line project in New Hampshire that will carry electricity from Quebec to southern New England. In this 50-minute film New Hampshire-based conservation photographer and author Jerry Monkman interviews people throughout the state to explain opposition to Northern Pass. Jerry also spent months in the field applying his signature landscape photography style to filming the places in the path of the project including the Appalachian Trail and the White Mountain National Forest. Electricity giant Hydro-Quebec needs to sell more of its electricity to New England and Eversource Energy wants to pitch in by distributing this power to customers in southern New England. To do that the companies have joined forces to build Northern Pass a 187-mile transmission line that will bisect the state of New Hampshire with high-voltage cable strung between 1500 steel towers rising as tall as 135 feet. Residents of the "Live Free or Die" state have a problem with that. New Hampshire is a place where people's connections to the land run deep. Its mountains and forest lakes and rivers are part working landscape and part outdoor playground and those opposed to Northern Pass see it as a desecration of this landscape. The Power of Place tells a compelling story by exploring the issues surrounding Northern Pass - its promise of bringing jobs and cheaper electricity to New England; the fears of those living next to the potential power line corridor; and the visual impact of the towers on iconic New Hampshire landscapes like the White Mountain National Forest The Appalachian National Scenic Trail and the state's Great North Woods Region.
