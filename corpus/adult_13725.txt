Music soothes the savage beast...and seduces the most beautiful women. You've undoubtedly heard of the famous classical composer Mozart but you may not be fully aware as to why he was so damn good on the harpsichord. You see more important than Mozart's love for music was his lust for the opposite sex and making music was simply his way of getting beautiful babes to make love to him. But he wasn't without his rivals other oversexed prodigies who also knew how to use their talents to seduce the most beautiful women in Europe including the Queen!
