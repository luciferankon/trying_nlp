Twelve hundred degree centigrade glowing orange lava is cast as the main character in this exploration of volcano science. Beginning with the Mother's Day 2002 eruption on the west flank of Kilauea Volcano the movie traces how scientists are monitoring this dynamic edifice. Tourists pour in to view lava oozing steaming and exploding into the Pacific Ocean as scientists whiz about in choppers and probe the flows.
