On 30 November 2010 Steve Hackett and band returned to the Shepherds Bush Empire to resounding applause after many stops abroad with the Around the World in Eighty Trains tour. While snow fell outside in a London blizzard within the atmosphere was burning. The band is in fine form and hot to trot and was joined by special guests Steven Wilson and John Wetton.
