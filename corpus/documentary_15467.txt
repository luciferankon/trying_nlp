In 1970 Decca Records released a Rock Opera concept album that blew a young girl's mind away. Growing up in an atheist home in a small Pennsylvania town why would Jesus Christ Superstar influence her so much? Original members of the recording session along with the grown-ups who remember their experiences with that LP attempt to answer some burning questions. Revelatory remembrances explore the mythology surrounding the recording sessions and the very genesis of the score before a single musician heard it.
