Claudia is a young actress. Finally she has been casted for her first leading role in a film based upon a true story: The Schiele-Murderer. While preparing for the role she meets Sylvia the real wife of the serial killer who has murdered five young women and draped their corpses to look like paintings by Egon Schiele. Since the murderer has been arrested his wife now lives in a sanatorium with her little still traumatized daughter. The fictional script of the film within the film Sylvia's reports and Claudia's fantasies cause a new chronology of the story - lies create more than one truth.
