Oh Yeah She Performs! is about four extraordinary women pursuing the same dream: composing producing and living from their own music - without compromising their ideals. A film about female musicians. Gustav aka Eva Jantschitsch allows us a glimpse into her creative process her private home studio the rundown cellar rooms where her band rehearses and backstage at her large concerts. She talks about the feeling of being exposed during performances the pressure of people's expectations and her role as a mother. Clara Luzia discusses the issues she encounters as a musician such as her health problems and precarious financial situation. She plays and sings to packed audiences at big concerts and allows us to film her band recording an album in a desolate farmhouse and accompany her to interviews with inquisitive journalists. Teresa Rotschopf - we firstly meet her as the frontwoman of the disco band "Bunny Lake". She gradually loosens her ties to the band and starts writing her own songs which she records with Viennese star producer Patrick Pulsinger. The film follows her to New York City where she performs her own compositions as a solo musician. Luise Pop aka Vera Kropf composes songs in the tradition of surf punk and Riot Girls. She not only sings writes and fronts a band but is also an outstanding guitarist. We follow her to rehearsals in a garden cottage and on tour through Austria's neighbouring countries and watch how she excels on her electric guitar and as a singer. The film revolves around the work of these four women portraying subtle emotions that hint at the various identities and the struggle to reconcile private and public personalities. The editing style connects these very different characters and highlights the dynamic plot.
