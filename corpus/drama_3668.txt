Sidney & Jax Bedford are Twin Sisters who live in small town Tennessee. Daughters of world renown musicians. Music Royalty. Seems perfect but every family has it's secrets. Music brings the girls together. It's pretty much the only thing they've ever agreed on since they were young. But Sidney does not want the attention & fame that comes along with being an artist (meanwhile all Jax craves is attention) so their songs have never left their living room. Until now. Sidney is swept up into a whirlwind of fame and adventure brought on by her sister Jax entering a magazine contest to open up for her celeb crush - the biggest pop star in the world - 'Jace Walker'; dragging them both into a wild world filled with love triangles sibling rivalry lies & music.
