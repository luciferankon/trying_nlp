On August 29 2005 Hurricane Katrina struck the United States gulf coast which left southern Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama in ruins and 80% of New Orleans underwater. With all the chaos that surrounded the relief efforts one federal agency shined brighter than any other the United States Coast Guard. With all the odds against them the Coast Guard was able to execute one of the largest search and rescue operations in history. Having lost vital communication and operational support systems to the storm the Coast Guard was still able to immediately carry out their duties. Only a few short hours after the hurricane's initial landfall Coast Guard Air Station New Orleans and Aviation Training Center Mobile began dispatching aircraft across the region and as the scope of the disaster became clear Coast Guard units from across the nation began sending aircrafts and crews for support. Over 5600 Coast Guard personnel participated in the relief efforts including reservists auxiliary and civilians. The United States Coast Guard performed one of the greatest search and rescue operations in history saving the lives of over 33500 people. These brave men and women redefined what it meant to be a hero being the only ray of hope for thousands.
