After briefly discussing William Shakespeare four filmmakers talk about the work of Marlon Brando who played Marc Antony in a 1953 film version of "Julius Caesar". The movie and TV writer William J. MacDonald discusses Brando's Zen-like approach to acting. Dennis Hopper who performed with him in "Apocalypse Now" calls Brando the greatest actor of the 20th century. Laurence Fishburne who acted in the same movie cites Brando's seven great films. John G. Avildsen relates anecdotes about directing Brando in "The Formula" (1980).
