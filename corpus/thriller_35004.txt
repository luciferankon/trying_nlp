For three years investment banker Elena Wagner (Julia Koschitz) was a shooting star at the investment bank Ahrends & Oppermann in Frankfurt. Elena is completely absorbed in climbing the career ladder and unconscionably sacrifices everything for it including her love affair with IT manager Marc (JÃ¼rgen Vogel). When she finds herself cut out of the loop from one day to another from meetings and her boss Dr. Ahrends (August Zirner) is no longer available for her she reconnects to her ex lover Marc to try and make sense of it. What starts as a coup in the banking milieu snowballs into a human drama about betrayal money and love in which none of the parties involved wants to lose control
