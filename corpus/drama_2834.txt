In the middle of the Kosovo war a village is about to be surrounded by the enemy. One man saves the village with the help of two old warriors and keeps the enemy at bay long enough for the villagers to escape safely. After the war the Hero's relation to his new country is not what one would expect of a war hero. He slowly gets forgotten and sidelined in the new order that reigns to the point of non existence. The film examines the slow degradation of the Hero at the hands of people who did nothing and leaves the question whether the viewer is watching a life imagined.
