When the owner of a struggling comic book store faces eviction he must snap out of his fantasy world in order to save his reality. Kooperman is a smart character-driven comedy bro-mance that blends rich visuals with a driving laugh-out-loud plot-line while commenting on society's obsession with superheroes in an age of apathy. Shot on beautiful Prince Edward Island by first time feature director Harmony Wagner this film was selected for the 2014 Telefilm Canada Micro-Budget Production Program and showcases a rich soundtrack of Canadian indie darlings such as Paper Lions Catherine MacLellan Nudie Coyote and Boxer the Horse. 'Kooperman is wacky zany...it's current... it's meaningful it's meaningless.' - John Dunsworth A.K.A. Mr. Lahey of The Trailer Park Boys
