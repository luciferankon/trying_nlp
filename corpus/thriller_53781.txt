Vucetich was born as Ivan Vucetic in Croatia then part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1882 he immigrated to Argentina. In 1891 Vucetich began the first filing of fingerprints based on ideas of Francis Galton which he expanded significantly. He became the director of the Center for Dactyloscopy in Buenos Aires. At the time he included the Bertillon system alongside the fingerprint files. In 1892 Vucetich made the first positive identification of a criminal in a case where Francisca Rojas had killed her two children and then cut her throat trying to put the blame on the outside attacker. A bloody print identified her as the killer. Argentine police adopted Vucetich's method of fingerprinting classification and it spread to police forces all over the world. Vucetich improved his method with new material and in 1904 published Dactiloscop√≠a Comparada ("Comparative Dactyloscopy"). He traveled to India and China and attended scientific conferences to gather more data. Juan Vucetich died in Dolores Buenos Aires.
