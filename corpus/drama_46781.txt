JONESTOWN is a dramatization of the story of Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple which ended tragically in the infamous mass suicide of over 900 American citizens in 1978. The story follows Reverend Jim Jones and his followers during Jones' rise from a socially active small town preacher to an important and respected Clergyman working toward a higher socialist goal. When a series of articles that speak of Jim and his loyal followers' physical punishments and sexual abuse directed at the Temple members are due to be released and potentially end Jones' mission he moves hundreds of his followers out to the jungles of Guyana where they will build their own 'socialist paradise' - JONESTOWN. Soon due to the mounting pressure from defectors and relatives of the Temple members Congressman Leo Ryan travels with the Concerned Relatives to investigate Jim Jones and the Temple's missions in Guyana only to end in what will later be remembered as the "Jonestown Massacre" which marked the single largest loss of American civilian lives in a non-natural disaster until 9/11.
