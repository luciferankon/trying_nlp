The documentary "Writing Down the River" is inspired by Kathleen Jo Ryan's book Writing Down the River: Into the heart of the Grand Canyon a collection of 15 essays by woman writers and Ryan's photographs. During the summer of 1997 each writer went on a raft trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. The documentary will tell the story of four of these writers rafting the Colorado River for the second time but traveling together for the first time. The diversity of these particular women offers an inside look into the relationship between people and wilderness as they journey down river. Their stories will be told against the backdrop of the breathtaking scenery of the Grand Canyon.
