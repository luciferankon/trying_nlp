Frans Masereel is one of the most fascinating Belgian artists of the 20th century. His work essentially composed of black and white engravings is a cry of rebellion against the tragedies of his time. Forced into exile for his pacifist convictions he embodied alongside writers like Stefan Zweig and Romain Rolland the dream of a cultural and brotherly Europe. Through an imaginary correspondence the director addresses to the artist the film sketches the portrait of a free touching man who throughout his life attempted to break free of art dealers and put his creations in the hands of all.
