PRAYER FOR A PERFECT SEASON is a gripping account of the 2010-11 boys' basketball season at St. Patrick High School located in a hardscrabble neighborhood of Elizabeth NJ. The film captures the intersection of two forces - the soaring media interest in the big game and the decline of Catholic school programs - while illuminating the real-life issues players and coaches confront during the season. Coached by Kevin Boyle the St. Patrick Celtics' 2010-11 team was loaded with talent and plagued by distractions. Star player Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (now a freshman at the University of Kentucky) was one of the nation's top performers and his elite skills had cast him in an unrelenting spotlight since grade school. When Kidd-Gilchrist was just two and a half years old his father was murdered and he also lost his surrogate father at the beginning of his senior year of high school. Complementing Kidd-Gilchrist senior shooting guard Derrick Gordon (ticketed for Western Kentucky University) must struggle with his twin brother's incarceration for aggravated assault. PRAYER FOR A PERFECT SEASON follows the roller-coaster ride of a team on the brink of history at a school on the verge of becoming insolvent where the journey to the top of the polls is inspiring but the future is filled with uncertainty. The quest for the perfect season comes down to a prime-time match-up title game played at Rutgers University before an overflow crowd as St. Patrick (26-0) confronts arch-nemesis St. Anthony (29-0) led by Basketball Hall of Fame coach Bob Hurley.
