GOLEM is a film about two drifting souls living on the edge. They are lost disconnected and have forgotten how to interact with others yet they cry out for warm contact and touch. Alienated from society and themselves each of them escapes in a unique way to fantasy violence and drugs. The film unfolds 48 hours in the lives of the two protagonists: Johnny a released prisoner abused by his prison cell-mate and May a suicidal and lonely street prostitute. The two appear to be contrastingly different anti-heroes who wander purposelessly in the streets of Tel Aviv. Their paths cross in a random bar and they embark on a shared journey together.
