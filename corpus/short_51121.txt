A middle-aged woman in rural dress and a young woman in a smarter dress are picking up herbs in a forest. The workload and the sunny day call for a halt for refreshment. The young girl disrobes and enters the nearby river in the nude followed by the mature woman who simply fathers her long skirts up to her waist revealing her naked thighs and white-slip covered buttocks. The camera follows them to the right capturing the water movement and their splashing about. (A white sunflower stands alone in the midst of the water creeks - hinting at the Production company's logo an 8-pointed star.) A fisherman arrives and starts throwing his hook at the fish with no results; so he moves to the right and throws the hook again this time capturing the heavy mature woman who comes from behind the curtain of willows complaining of pain in the lower of her back. A policeman in city uniform and white casket appears to expel both the fisherman and the woman from the place. Running quickly from the right the young girl picks her clothes up and dresses again (to a fading in black).
