Life is a vicious cycle...an inevitable belief...roped with destiny...with hues of emotions drama compassion love intensity friendship...and vulnerability that etches and grounds you profoundly about the word "LIFE" which is too brutal at times. But we all believe that life can leapfrog and take a big "U" turn astoundingly. This is skillfully depicted in Rufus Parker's home production "Ammuvagiya Naan" aka "I Am Ammu" a film about a young woman raised in a brothel who despite being harassed must learn to live in a normal society when an established writer marries her.
