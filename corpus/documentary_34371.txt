A two-hour real-time canal boat journey down one of Britain's most historic waterways the Kennet and Avon Canal from Top Lock in Bath to the Dundas Aqueduct. Using an uninterrupted single shot the film is a rich and absorbing antidote to the frenetic pace and white noise of modern life. Taking in the images and sounds of the British countryside underpinned by the natural soundscape of water lapping surrounding birdsong and the noise of the chugging engine this is a chance to spot wildlife and glimpse life on the towpath while being lulled by the comforting rhythm of a bygone era. Along the journey graphics and archive stills embedded into the passing landscape deliver salient facts about the canal and its social history.
