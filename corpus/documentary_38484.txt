Filmmaker Dan Murdoch spent last summer documenting clashes between a resurgent Ku Klux Klan and a growing Black Power movement. Now in a follow up to 'KKK: The Fight for White Supremacy' he returns to America to revisit some of the people he met from the KKK and also meet members of the Black Liberation Movement: to find out what black power means what their motivations are and why their movement seems to be gaining traction. With rare access to members of the Black Liberation Movement Murdoch quickly finds himself in the midst of an armed black militia outraged at the treatment of black people at the hands of police patrolling the streets of their communities and calling for change.
