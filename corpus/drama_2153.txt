Based in Vikrampur village Dhuri lives an impoverished lifestyle along with his wife Razia and a sister Champa. He is a farmer owns a small piece of land and two oxen Heera and Moti. He hopes to get Champa married to a fellow farmer by the name of Pashupati. He lends his oxen to Roopnandan who enters them in a race and they win much to the chagrin of the Zamindar who sends his agent Bansilal Mehta with Rs.100/- to acquire the oxen. When Razia refuses to sell an enraged Zamindar sets the entire community against Dhuri and his family - blacklisting as well as pitting Pashupati against him. When Dhuri approaches the Panchayat - he will soon learn that the 'Parmeshwar' is missing from the 'Panch' as it is being controlled and manipulated by the Zamindar; his oxen will not only go missing but he will have his land taken away - leaving him with no option but to re-locate elsewhere.
