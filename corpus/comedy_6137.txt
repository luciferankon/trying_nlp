On Johnnie Talk our host Johnnie (who's face is never seen) has a short talk show. The difference being he does his business (pun intended) in the bathroom of Nickelodeon Studios. He interviews and plays games with various staff members of Nick's greatest Nicktoons. Games such as "Name that Nicktoon" "Guess how many tiles" and "Can you sing it" keeps the guest on their toes and the audience entertained.
