HORST. is a very personal film which deals with an essential human desire in life: How to find acceptance and love? Can love between partners between a person and his family be strong enough to last longer than death? What does really stay after a person's gone? With fragments such as letters and found footage I'll go on a journey to follow my uncle's footsteps and glimpse into his life in New York City of the 80's and 90's.
