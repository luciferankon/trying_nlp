Nobel Laureate and human rights advocate Elie Wiesel talks with Bill Moyers about his own childhood experiences at Auschwitz and analyzes the source of Nazi hatred toward Jews--"we weren't human in their eyes." Wiesel reflects on his own apparent inability to hate and discusses ethnic hatred at work in Bosnia and other Eastern European countries since the end of the Cold War. Of contemporary world affairs Wiesel says that "Hate is a common threat... Eastern Europe is gaining freedom. The American government and the Russian government are now almost allies... What jeopardizes those achievements is hate."
