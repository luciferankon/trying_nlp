Naturalist Mike Dilger is on a mission to seek out Britain's natural invaders. He's off to find out a bevy of botany and beasts here by accident or design and now mingling with our native wildlife. A surprising array of plants and animals make this island far richer than you might think. Colonies of Indian scorpions Tasmanian wallabies and giant American Bull frogs are obvious intruders. And yet rabbits horseradish doves and goats are also ancient invaders. This is the story of how Britain's wild invaders came here and how in some cases they've changed the face of Britain. On a journey from London to Loch Lomond Mike will shed new light on our own backyard - British wildlife sometimes exotic and sometimes familiar but always surprising. Wildlife anyone can see once you know what to look for and where to start looking.
