Just watched it on gettv and it was one of the old-fashioned variety Christmas shows staring Bing Crosby his family Robert Goulet Mary Costa and the Mitchell Boys Choir. A very refreshing taste of Christmas that really displayed the magic and goodwill that Christmas is all about. They just don't have these anymore.
