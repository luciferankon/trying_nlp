Chez Schwartz takes us inside a year in the life of Schwartz's Deli - the unique 75-year-old landmark on Montreal's historic Main. Filmed through changing seasons from the quiet of early morning preparation to the frenetic bustle of packed lunch times and never ending line-ups to the more relaxed ambiance late at night - Chez Schwartz is an evocative cinematic portrait of a small spunky deli known worldwide equally for its atmosphere and smoked meat. Through observational vignettes we come to know the men of Schwartz's - Frank Johnny Alex and others: the waiters and busboys meat cutters and grill men who have become fixtures of the deli - some for as long as 40 years. Most are immigrants from Portugal Eastern Europe Latin America and Asia. While they serve generously stacked sandwiches fries pickles and cherry colas to an array of local and international patrons we discover how a legendary institution transforms their lives. As we get to know their stories we also meet another group of men - Ryan Herman and Adrian: the panhandlers who have stationed themselves at the front entrance for the past 15 years and earn their livelihood from the deli's patrons. As these stories interweave we become immersed in the restaurant's culture and daily rituals. Lush and sensual cinematography follows the daily preparation and consumption of spiced smoked meat and condiments. Our camera moves between privileged revelations of character and simple gastronomy as we capture the magic of a classic 'hole in the wall' packed with atmosphere and dynamism.
