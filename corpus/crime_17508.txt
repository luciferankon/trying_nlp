It's a typical morning on Main Street in Small Town South Carolina just outside of Beaufort. As businesses open their doors bank teller Jake Braddis singlehandedly shuts down Liberty Bank & Trust with a .45 Magnum and a score to settle with society. Within minutes Jake has the town in the palm of his hand as loved ones fear for the lives of eight hostages the wealthy about their money and cops prepare to deal with their first crime of this magnitude. Detective Zeke Richmond arrives first learning that his father Eugene and Mayor Kate Bailey are amongst the hostages. Never one to miss an opportunity for leverage Jake demands that Chief Annabelle Turner put Zeke in charge of negotiations or prepare for a body count. Suddenly an unwilling partner in the day's events Zeke gets a crash course in history crime and politics from Jake but his own friendships with residents on both sides of the law makes it difficult for him to handle the investigation without suspicion from members of his own team. Events take a turn for the worse when Jake announces he is working with a silent accomplice named "Buddy". Detective Richmond puts all of his talents to use as the innocence of the entire community is challenged. In what ultimately gets coined "The Mayhem on Main Street" the question remains how do you solve a crime when the suspect list consists of everyone you know and trust?
