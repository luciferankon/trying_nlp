Bu Lai'a in namesake sounds very close to Bull Liar (a local expression for someone prone to embellishment of the truth). He is proud to be Hawaiian and if you listen to him suddenly everyone is his cousin -- or he was a pro surfer -- or he holds the answers to running the government in Hawaii better than those in charge.
