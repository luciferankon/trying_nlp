During the 1970's Tammi (pronounced TA-mee) Tyler was one of the stars of the sitcom "Here Comes Corky." Her acting career was then cut short unexpectedly when after eating a cupcake laced with PCP she killed her costar Captain Billy. In the intervening years Tammi grew up amid obscurity. Now Tammi was employed by the Funky Fox Cafe in the San Fernando Valley's Plaza del Toro shopping center and was hoping for a comeback. As she explained to barmaid Patti in the first episode she hoped the marry the next man to visit the Funky Fox. Embarrassingly it turned out to be Harve Krudup who owned the Starbrite Cleaners laundry store at the shopping center. Tammi felt that the store was part of a Beverly Hills-based chain only to realize that it was the only laundry store Harve owned. Tammi's attempts to make a comeback in Hollywood formed most of the stories for this sitcom.
