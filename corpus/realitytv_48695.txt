The Happy Ending Bar sends four bartenders across the country in an effort to find the perfect location to open their next establishment. The glamorous and unglamorous sides of the rock star life of bartending are revealed in this knock down drag out romp through high end high-class nightclubs to hole in the wall backwoods hillbilly drunken barfight ridden watering holes. We'll see not only what goes on in front of the bar but behind the alcohol curtain - Set ups clean ups hook ups shut downs and nervous breakdowns. Whoever said bartending was easy was drunk off generous over-pours. These guys work and party hard from town to town living off just their charm and their tips; both of which fluctuate dramatically from night to night... What works in LA just might get you cold-cocked in South Dakota. Lord forgive them for they know not what they'll do in the Bible Belt. Never being sure if they'll make enough money to get to the next city takes a toll on the best of friends. Throw in an RV a stake in the bar-to-be an endless supply of women and alcohol egos libidos and a shared toilet with poor ventilation and you've got a recipe for reality show magic. Empty your bowels and cleanse your liver before you hop on board this fast paced fucked up road trip across the land of the free and the home of the depraved.
