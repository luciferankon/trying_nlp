The '30s. Corruption and decline form a background of New York a city which has by now changed beyond recognition because of the Great Depression. Money is scarce as well as justice and integrity. In his small office on Lexington Avenue the ex-policeman and now private detective Jack Del Nero remembers his past before a bottle of whiskey. He is unaware of the fact that the call he is going to receive will drag him into an intricate spiral of events. The murder of his ex-colleague Little Emily and the great eclipse are just a few elements of the tortuous path he has to run through in his hunt for the cat with the jade eyes.
