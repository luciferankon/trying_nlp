This short documentary follows the MARC commuter train line between Washington D.C. and Baltimore Maryland. It highlights real people and places along the tracks but simulates an impossible experience allowing the viewer to hop off the train between stops and linger where the train normally whizzes by. The film features diverse locations from the suburbs to the ghetto and attempts to capture a wide range of human experience through interviews and vignettes. By revealing the depths inherent in seemingly unimportant lives and locations the project reminds the viewer that there are stories unfolding around us everywhere we go.
