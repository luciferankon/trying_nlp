This short (11 minute) documentary actually feels more like a music video. The event is the 1977 World Frisbee Championships and the venue is the Rose Bowl in Pasadena California. The film moves from event to event showcasing Ultimate Guts Human Freestyle and finally the Frisbee Dogs. The music is very cool appropriate and well selected.
