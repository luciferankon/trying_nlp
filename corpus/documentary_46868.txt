It gets in your blood says a resident of Picher Oklahoma about his sense of hometown pride. His words however take on a powerful irony in this documentary about the toxic legacy of Picher's lead mining industry. Since their town was declared a Superfund site in 1981 Picher's residents have been forced to choose between preserving their image of the American dream and preserving their health. The Creek Runs Red carries us into the heart of this sharply divided community to reveal with extraordinary intimacy and insight the full human tragedy of environmental catastrophe.
