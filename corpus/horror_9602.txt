Arkham Sanitarium is an anthology of three short stories faithfully adapted from the works of H.P. Lovecraft - each of the three stories is set in 1930s New England (specifically Providence Rhode Island and the fictional town of Arkham Massachusetts). The stories are connected by an original 'wraparound' story. In this story - set in the 1950s - Alice Crow investigates the strange stories surrounding the infamous Arkham Sanitarium.
