The new secret daily entertainment of watching the women change their clothes at the beginning and the end of their shift soon turns into the only attractive feature of the factory in the eyes of various tradesmen causing a boom in crate sales. The management's conflicts with the workers however leads to rebellion when the women find out that their naked bodies were used for marketing purposes.
