In 2003 Face Tomorrow toured the UK with AFI playing the NME Awards at the London Astoria amongst others. But since the release of their new record 'The Closer You Get' in May of 2004 the band has been really hitting it off. They've played all over Europe and the Unites States selling out clubs and playing some of the biggest festivals along the way. (Pukkelpop Lowlands Ringfest Popkomm Groezrock etc.) On 'The Closer You Get' their mix of hardcore punk pop rock and indie has been perfectioned even further. Reviews are raving but not only on record Face Tomorrow manages to convince; they're a typical live-act. With hundreds of energetic and intense live shows across Europe the band has created a big and strong fan base. Now finally captured on video!
