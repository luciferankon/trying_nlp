In a rage a vagrant who has just been shoved out of the way roughly hits Christ on a calvary. Driven mad by hunger the vagrant pounces at a passing peasant but the moment he is about to hit him Jesus Christ appears before him. Later on a fire breaks out and the destitute man rushes towards the flames and saves a little child. But exhausted by effort and hunger he finally dies. A poor half-starved wayfarer asks several of the villagers for help or work without avail. No one will give him food or even a kindly word. Even a lad eating bread on the porch of his home refuses him a morsel. Bitter and despairing this poor sufferer ultimately finds himself before one of those gigantic crosses which uplift themselves so conspicuously above the Normandy landscape. Disgusted with human nature he raises his stick and reviles the figure of Christ upon the Cross. At the same moment a laborer appears coming down the road and the outcast feels impelled to fall upon him and strike him. He holds himself in readiness watching the countryman slowly approaching and then with uplifted stick springs forward but in place of the laborer stands the figure of Christ who leads him back to the foot of the Cross and points out the words carved on the base "Love Ye One Another." The stick falls hate and curses give way to sobs and the wayfarer readily understands and continues on his way. Suddenly the alarm bell rings out. He turns and sees one of the farmhouses in flames. The youth who had refused him bread is helpless in the upper part and the villagers are running to and fro distracted. A ladder is raised and with sudden strength the tramp goes up and through choking smoke and falling rafters snatches the lad in his arms and takes him down to safety. Reaching the ground he falls and rough hands are now eager to lend him assistance. Alas! It is too late; he has given all he had to give his own poor wretched life to a fellow-creature.
