My Life Unabridged...I was asked a few months ago why haven't I made a documentary about my life by a producer in South Carolina. To be honest I had not thought about it. But now that I have I have decided that it just might be a good idea. We only live once! So we (my crew and I) are making a documentary of my life this wonderful Journey that I have experienced from childhood to present day. I have had an amazing life from growing up in the military to traveling the world meeting amazing people seeing wonderful things..and also I have seen and experienced the dark-side of life from those who inhabit this planet and the evil that tries to take over when you are making your way through Life. I hope that you will enjoy it once it is released...
