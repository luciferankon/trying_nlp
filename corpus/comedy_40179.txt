Do you or does someone you know have trouble coping with life? Does the world totally suck for you or that person? Maybe there's a loved one or colleague who's just really annoying and you'd like to get them the help they need. We're LifeS Anonymous. Let's face it interventions are awkward and messy and who has the time these days anyway? When none of the other rehabs or treatments work that's where our work begins. We're LifeS Anonymous. Making life suck less.
