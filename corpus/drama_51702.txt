The Temptation of Christ is detailed in the Gospels of Matthew Mark and Luke. According to these texts after being baptized by John the Baptist Jesus fasted for forty days and forty nights in the Judaean Desert. During this time Satan appeared to Jesus and tried to tempt him. After having refused each of Satan's temptations Jesus returned to Galilee to begin his ministry.
