In this lighthearted throwback to 1960s beach movies a genial bartender needs the help of his devoted friends (and a bit of supernatural assistance) to save the family business from his avaricious partner intent on selling out to a corporate coffeehouse chain. Eddy Anchor wants nothing more than to keep the legacy of his late father's beach bar alive. However his financial partner Chester Greenfield III has other plans. With his ownership of the bar in jeopardy Eddy needs his beach-bum pal Frankie part-time clairvoyant Aunt Gloria and a pair of intrepid reporters looking for a scoop to show Chester that corporate greed is not match for friends family and loyalty.
