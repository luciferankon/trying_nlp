This groundbreaking event took place in Germany and brought the worlds of off-road and rally racing together. "Powerdays" is the brainchild of rally savant Armin Schwartz and features four classes of off-road vehicles racing on the same course at the same time. The half-hour program showcases rally drivers Ken Block Petter Solberg and Gigi Galli along with off-road racers Jesse James "Ballistic" BJ Baldwin Gustavo Vildosola and Danny Sullivan. Powerdays which was sanctioned by SCORE International and viewed live by more than 50000 German race fans includes some of the most intense off-road racing action ever captured on film. Highlights of the show include BJ Baldwin jumping over Ken Block while a freestyle motocross team executes tricks over BJ in the midst of a massive fireworks show!
