The story of Frank Bender is one of the most surreal fascinating and macabre tales -- so out of the ordinary that it borders on science fiction. One of the best forensic sculptors in the world he was sought after by the FBI Scotland Yard INTERPOL and the television series "America's Most Wanted". He had an uncanny ability to recreate the faces of unidentified murder victims and wanted fugitives. It was his mission to speak for the dead and exact justice when all hope was gone. Director Karen Mintz was allowed incredible access to interview and film Frank during the last year of his life as he faced his own mortality while battling terminal cancer. She followed his progress as he worked to complete his final facial reconstruction - "The Boy Under the Billboard". Frank gave numerous families a sense of peace and closure by answering the agonizing question of what happened to their missing loved ones. We want to honor Frank with a documentary that brings to life his courage and many contributions to society. He was the subject of articles in the New York Times Harpers Esquire and People Magazine as well as two New York Times bestselling books. This is the only documentary about his life and work.
