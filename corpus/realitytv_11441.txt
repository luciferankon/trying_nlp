The Kennedy family has the perfect trip to Hawaii planned; time at a fancy resort and they rented a house on the other side of the island. But things don't exactly go as planned. Daughter Kenya breaks her nose before the trip they are nearly deafened by thousands of birds and their rental car breaks down in the middle of the wilderness. The Montano family sets out on a cruise from New Zealand to Australia starting with a stopover in Fiji. Control freak mom Judy has planned a very thorough 50 page itinerary. A wandering grandparent nearly ruins their plans but the Montanos still have a great time hanging with the koalas and kangaroos and seeing the Sydney Opera House and the Blue Mountains.
