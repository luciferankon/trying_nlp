It's summertime in the picturesque countryside of the Swedish west coast. In an old stone stable on the grounds of an Empire style castle actor/director GÃ¶rel Crona and her ensemble of actors are preparing Crona's staging of the Strindberg play The Dance of Death starring herself and Johannes Brost in the lead roles. During the last 10 days leading up to the premier we follow four people on a collision course. What happens when one of the actors doesn't live up to Crona's high expectations?
