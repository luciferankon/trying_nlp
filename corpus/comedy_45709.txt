Change is an enchanted place where the past is impossibility and the future does not yet exist. It is a place where love beauty and the forces of life are a reality. Change is a place which the main hero finds incredibly exciting. It is a place where the waves break on the shore and where love finishes where the seasons change. Every moment captured by the camera in this film is about change.
