The Danube Delta. The modern era slowly creeps between the branches of the river into a seemingly closed world of people living by their own rules. Computers and the internet are added to God and the river toil in the people's conversations. Old boats are corroding and shipyards aren't building hew ones anymore. People talk about the past but take no interest in the future. They say that if you have a boat you don't have to worry because if you don't eat the fish you sell it. Tourism arrives. Who is going to benefit from it? The locals or large companies from elsewhere which are beginning to buy out the land?
