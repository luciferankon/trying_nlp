Sex Jokes & Rock N' Roll! is a film that captures a tour of the same name by comedians Jentle Phoenix Adam Richmond and Claude Stuart. During their infamous tour of California these 3 entertainers shine their talents at The Gold Country Casino to a sold-out crowd! "S J & R N' R!" also features some interesting behind-the-scenes interviews with the stars and interactions between them and their fans. Though each of them is high-energy physical and prone to sing frequently on stage; they're simultaneously very distinct from each other - AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS FILM INTERESTING. Not to mention the absurdly unpredictable finale with the whole team. You'll laugh and rock out enjoy!
