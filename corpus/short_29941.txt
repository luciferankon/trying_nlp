In October of 2007 a series of wildfires tore through many of southern California's migrant farm worker communities. After being forced out of their homes many of these workers were then turned away from evacuee camps due to their inability to prove citizenship. El Bracero "The Laborer" is a film about a displaced Chicano man who struggles to find work in a rural California town due to these devastating fires.
