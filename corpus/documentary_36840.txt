SOMEWHERE BETWEEN tells the intimate stories of four teenaged girls. They live in different parts of the US in different kinds of families and are united by one thing: all four were adopted from China because all four had birth parents who could not keep them due to personal circumstances colliding with China's "One Child Policy". These strong young women allow us to grasp what it is like to come-of-age in today's America as trans-racial adoptees. At the same time we see them as typical American teenagers doing what teenagers everywhere do...struggling to make sense of their lives. Through these young women and their explorations of who they are we ourselves pause to consider who we are - both as individuals and as a nation of immigrants. Identity racism and gender...these far-reaching issues are explored in the documentary. And with great honesty and courage these four girls open their hearts to experience love compassion and self-acceptance.
