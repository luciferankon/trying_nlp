This television special documented the 2000 "Jimmy Carter Work Project" - a Habitat for Humanity event where volunteers built hundreds of homes for the financially disadvantaged across the United States in one week. The week ended with Habitat for Humanity dedicating the 100000th house built since its founding in 1976.
