This is a history of the England's Ealing Film Studios from its beginnings in 1902. It follows the studio's successes through the 1930's World War II dramas the well-known 'Ealing comedies' with 'Alec Guinness' (qv) and the BBC's television productions. At the end we see the resurrection of Ealing with the release of _Importance of Being Earnest The (2002)_.
