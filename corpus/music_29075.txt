This concert which was filmed at Sweden Rock Festival in June 2013 is not only a massive greatest hits show in front of 30000 people it also marks the 30th anniversary of the band. They celebrate by playing 28 songs spanning their whole career. Between the heavy rock songs they also sit down for an emotional acoustic set which brings an intimate feel to this otherwise massive arena show.
