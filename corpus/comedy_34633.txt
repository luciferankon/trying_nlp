A toilet lady gets an undercover visit by a tax collector who notices several infractions and sends her an invoice of more than 300.000 Euro. While in the public restroom the tax collector also finds out someone has been dealing drugs and starts selling powdered sugar to the local junks pretending it is cocaine. In the meantime a serial killer has been trying to flush his victims' body parts down the drain.
