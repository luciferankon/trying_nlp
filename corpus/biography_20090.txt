Lord Pandurang the king of Pandharpur who features in almost all of the devotional songs or 'abhangs' of the famous Saints of Maharashtra beside Tukaram Dnyaneshwar Namdev Janai etc. is etched in the heart of every single person of Maharashtra. Occupying a very special place in the heart of Lord Pandurang is Bhakt Pundalik is a famous saint of Maharashtra whose name is chanted before even that of the Lord. So impressed was the Lord when he witnessed a devout Pundalik serving his parents that on Pudalik's request he decided to stay in Pandharpur.
