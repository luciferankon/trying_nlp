Filmed just before the Carnation Revolution of 1974. Dark portrait of a group of friends who used to be colleagues at the University in 1962. Ten years later they have lost all their ideals. With Lisbon on the background they discuss politics love culture; each of them has reached a deadlock. The camera remains still while it registers the dissolution of their dreams.
