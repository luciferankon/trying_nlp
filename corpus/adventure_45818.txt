Kelly Jordan (Robert Lowery) and Andy Melton (Robert Kent) are former AAF fliers operating a cargo service over the South American mountain ranges in order to get enough money to return to Texas and buy a commercial line. Andy is killed when his overloaded plane crashes and explodes. Kelly meets Laurey Roberts (Ann Savage) who gets him to take her to the mining-camp operation as a cook as she is running away from her ex-husband Tom Hammond (Douglas Fowley) who has just been released from prison. Hammond catches up with Laurey but he is killed in a gun fight and Kelly and Laurie leave looking for a peaceful life in Texas.
