Meet the Salomon Family. Micky and Jason "Brothers" experience tragedy at a young age. The best way to describe the events that followed is nothing short of "the truth is stranger than fiction." Based on actual events we meet many colorful characters including a prospect of a local bike club who also happens to be Micky's childhood friend. This edgy cut throat drama lets us experience the city that is Pittsburgh in a way that has yet to be seen. Taking place in the late nineties we watch as the bonds of loyalty and trust are challenged by the desire for money and power.What lengths will one take to be accepted? Is our life predetermined or do our actions decide our destiny?
