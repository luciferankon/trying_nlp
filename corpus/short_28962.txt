The Duke is a jolly fellow and when coming into the public square with his royal train he espies a comical-looking man he hits upon a merry idea. The helpless man is put into the royal litter and taken to the palace where he is first robed as befits blue blood. He is seated in the official throne and here follows a funny scene as he receives the courtiers and fair ladies who enter into the jest with a vim A grand feast is spread for him but the Duke's sorcerers cause it to disappear when he attempts to help himself. His befuddled brain wrestles with the situation but presently abandons all attempts at eating and calls for drink. A bottle which is placed before him however assumes gigantic proportions as he reaches for it and finally it vanishes. Then the servants bring in a huge funnel and he is filled with liquor until his abdominal proportions resemble a balloon. In this condition he is taken to a bed chamber where he is worked upon by the Duke's doctors and he comes down to normal size: then he is put to bed. But his thirst does not allow him to slumber and he arises. Suddenly the paintings on the wall become animated drinking hopping from his grasp and other magic effects show him only drinking men and girls. By this time the Duke has tired of the fun and the poor man is carried back to where he was found in the square. Others of his ilk drag him into the road and he is left kicking his way out from under tables and chairs which are piled upon him.
