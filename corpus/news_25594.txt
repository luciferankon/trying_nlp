Promotion of the 250BOYCOTT a movement to boycott and ban home rents and mortgages in favor of Sanctuary Home Titles. A movement to END homelessness globally and peacefully by utilizing the portability and power of a new symbol. The 250BOYCOTT is the bridge to the new Human economy and to an age of shared stability with the standard of living raised for all Humans. A Home is a Human right. The seeds are planted the movement is growing. Peace to you my friends.
