This program provides a journey through the most representative markets of a megalopolis. After an historic look at some of the types of provisions and the commercialization of supplies and other products in Mexico - Tenochtitlan and in the capital of New Spain we approach the situation of current markets. We look at those that are in decay those that survive and those that persist with a renewed impetus; history and decline in the market of La Merced; the rise and the colossal infrastructure of the market of Central de Abasto; the tradition of selling products for witchcraft and herbal remedies in Mercado de Sonora; the intimate antiques of the tianguis (markets) of La Lagunilla and the iron-clad and extravagant exuberance of tianguis of El Chopo. Take a look come closer what will take away with you?.
