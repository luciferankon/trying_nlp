Accommodated since Algeria's Bloody Decade of the 1990s in the 'House of the Press' the journalists of the famous daily newspaper El Watan await the completion of their new offices a symbol of their independence. My camera is embedded in their newsroom as they follow the events of this new Algerian spring... President Bouteflika has set his sights on a 4th term. Beyond what we call the Arab revolutions and other mediatized terms I wanted this film to serve as a memorial to the women and men young and less young who battle daily to safeguard the freedom of information in a politically and socially fossilized country.
