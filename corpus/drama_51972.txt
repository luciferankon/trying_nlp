In life we first organize large stones (Piedras) such as love friendship family and a career. In this way we will find space between these to fit smaller stones our small necessities. If you act in an inverse way you will not have the room for larger stones. The five protagonists of my film are women who have not been able to organize the large "stones" in their lives. Ram√≥n Salazar Spanish director defines his first feature Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel conflicting trajectory of five women: Anita Isabel Adela Leire and Maricarmen. All are endeavoring to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path or worst that are in their shoes. They are five Cinderellas in search of prince charming and a new chance in life.
