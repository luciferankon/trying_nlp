Today mankind is lost in a world full of violence destruction and chaos. They have become disconnected from their ancestral roots while being enslaved by globalism. Humanity has fallen victim to the powers of few. People once showed no fear when standing eye to eye with their enemy but today fewer and fewer have the emotional and spiritual strength to stand up for their sovereignty protect families and freedom. I am Skadi the Norse goddess of winter hunting and just revenge. I offer hope to humanity. I will share with you my warrior spirit love and courage. Awaken the warrior in you.
