A pretty reporter is caught snooping into the villainous Claw family's background. Hooded bound and gagged she's brought before the family matriarch who is only too happy to regale the scribe with tale of wrongdoing from the 1700s when the family's ancestor was cursed by a buxom captive and ever after forced to keep their faces masked in public. Ma Claw tells the reporter of female journalist the Claw family has turned into hero bait how she fell in love with her husband while bound and gagged and how the scion of the family stole a time machine and captured two pretty time cops and sent the prisoners back in time to the Big Bang.
