Twenty-three-years-old Martin Holík ('Svatopluk Skopal' (qv)) works in soil drainage gang and shares lodgings in a trailer with the other workers. From time to time he stays over with attractive Manca ('Jana Brejchová' (qv)) the local shop assistant. Just as the tattoo on his chest reminds the others more of a chicken than of an eagle so Martin himself is more of an immature boy than the grown-up man that he would like to be seen as. His insecurity has been the cause of his unfounded jealousy and distrust of his wife Bozena ('Nada Konvalinková' (qv)) and he has run away from their home village leaving her behind with their young son.
