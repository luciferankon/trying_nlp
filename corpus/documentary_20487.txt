The interior of an empty theater. The hall seats the curtain the lights. On the stage occupying the center with solemnity a piano. Everything is empty nothing moves but the sound tells us otherwise. The atmosphere speaks of a roomful where a piano plays intimate but surely a composition of Garc√≠a Abril. We feel the breath of the public we don't see it sounds then La Gitanilla a Garcia Abril masterpiece. We hear the applause of a theater that vibrates excited. Who is behind this music that crossed borders and touches us irremediably? Who is this man sensible and wise who celebrates 80 years?
