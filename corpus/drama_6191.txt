Ellison (aka L) just graduated high school and life is breezy. But after his father suddenly dies all his security is gone. He bounces from place to place staying with a series of friends before landing on the street and into a shelter. Desperate he tries to enlist but the asthma he got from government housing disqualifies him for the Army. Finally he turns to Zee his charismatic wealthy neighbor who has hustled his way up from the streets. Will L honor his hard-working father or go the way of the streets?
