Her Innocence And Beauty Were Overwhelming! Thousands of mile away situated deep in the heart of the South African bush there exists a Bordello. It is an old rustic yet exotic establishment that houses scores and scores of beautiful girls. There they are obliged to serve and cater to the desires of the passionate and sometime peculiar aristocracy. "Object of Desire" is exquisitely photographed and made in the style of "Emmanuelle" and "Story of O" except of course the scenes are of an explicit nature. Featuring Juliet Anderson of "Aunt Peg" fame!
