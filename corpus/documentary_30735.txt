You Can't Ask That is about breaking down stereotypes and offering genuine insight into the lives of people who live with labels. The series gives an unmediated platform to some of the most misunderstood or marginalized people in our country: short statured wheelchair users transgender Muslims ex-prisoners fat Indigenous sex workers terminally ill and people in polyamorous relationships. You Can't Ask That invited Australians to anonymously send in the naive cheeky or uncomfortable questions they wish they could ask these groups of people but never had the courage to ask in person. By putting these questions directly to our guests You Can't Ask That features confronting moving and surprising answers to the awkward questions we often judge people by. You Can't Ask That is moving insightful and refreshingly inappropriate offering some of the most judged and least understood people in our community a platform to speak directly to Australia.
