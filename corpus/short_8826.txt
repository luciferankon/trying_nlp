The Williston Basin is 10000 square miles of prairie. For awhile it was the frontier now it's settled primarily by families farming wheat. Then a few years after World War II petroleum companies got the idea of drilling there. Within a few weeks representatives of six companies offer to lease the mineral rights of a couple's farm: 10 cents an acre per year for ten years plus one-eighth of any oil revenues. They sign but it's a year before any wells are drilled - the first one goes in at a cost of $500000. Will they hit oil and turn the area into the frontier again? Everyone has dreams of what to do with the money.
