This architectural moving drawing constituted of a pair of dual-screened structural films deals with the progress of the sun through a South London Victorian terraced house. The primary occupier of the house is sunlight; the touch of the sun is a substitute for the touch of the viewer allowing the viewer to enter the space through association with the sunlight. Although the films appear to record a single day the footage was shot over a longer period over which the solar elevation and azimuth significantly alter their relationship. 'Sunhouse Elevation' is structured by the sun's angle of elevation above the horizon and 'Sunhouse Azimuth' by the solar azimuth calculated from due North.
