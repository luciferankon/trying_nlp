'The Great African Scandal' investigates how the involvement of organizations such as the IMF and the World Bank and the privatisation and liberalisation of Ghana's economy have caused the extreme poverty in Ghana today. The presenter tries to experience what it is like to live like a normal person from Ghana and at the same time tries to question people on the origin of their poverty. First he tries to make a living on a rice farm. Then he visits some coffee farms and discovers the frequent occurrence of child labour. Finally he visits a village which totally depends on the nearby gold mine which is partially owned by a large foreign company.
