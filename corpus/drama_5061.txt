Zeno and Rossana have been together for a few years; they are slowly growing apart and the move to a new city exacerbates the distance between them. It doesn't help that he works as a nightwatchman and that she has left a satisfying job teaching music to children to follow him and is now out of work. During his endless nocturnal rounds with his lively colleague Tom Zeno meet a pretty Romanian waitress Ela and begins a flirtation that eventually leads to a passionate kiss. As expected Zeno and Rossana's relationship deteriorates even further and not even the news that Rossana is expecting their child can help them reconnect.
