Garage Rock pioneers The Charms are a huge part of the growing underground Rock and Roll revival. This DVD documents the first 3 years of their existence in an incredibly honest and realistic story of the ups and downs of a real Rock and Roll band. It includes commentary from Little Steven Van Zandt and Kim Fowley and examines how being in a band parallels other close-knit relationships: love hate confusion deception triumphs boredom and the will to succeed. "I don't care if there are ten people at a gig or ten thousand The Charms are gonna win them over" - Steven Van Zandt
