Children in Manors is about freedom love anger and what the 1970's was like for some. This is the story of two film students documenting a day in the life of a small group of English hippies. To find out what makes them tick and how they live. Some of them have very strong political views about all the world's problems some would rather forget the world all together and live the rest of there life out in a dream state and some turn to the power of music to express their feelings but the one thing there all have in common is they all want change.
