Meet The Family is an urban comedy that takes place in an African American family's dining room. The Rump family has congregated for dinner in order to meet the eldest son Humphrey's new girlfriend Lacy. Humphrey however thinks that he is bringing Lacy home to meet only his parents; he has no idea that his siblings grandparents and other family members and friends are waiting to meet his new love. When the family meets Lacy hilarity ensues as they are not expecting a petite white female to be on Humphrey's arm. The Rumps do not try to put on a show for Lacy; they remain their funny and sometimes crude selves. Her naivet√© adds to the comedic element because even Grandma's sexual innuendos go over her head. The Rump family embraces Lacy as one of its own and Lacy springs some of her own surprises at the dinner table.
