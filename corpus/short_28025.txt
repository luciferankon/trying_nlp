A man dressed with a black cape walks in the city stopping at every café;. But people dispel him thinking he's bringing misfortune. But he wants only to meet a woman before he dead. He hold a packet in your hands. Finally he goes into a café and sit down at a table. He listen to the voices of the people inside and has emotions in common with them. Then he wants a phone. But perhaps everything is in his imagination even the following walk in the garden the meeting with Martha and the too many letters among the dead leaves.
