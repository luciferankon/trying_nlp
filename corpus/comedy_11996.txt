Bob and Susan Landers Leave behind their hectic big city life to rekindle their love for one another by moving out to the country for some fresh air friendly folk and down home hospitality. Unfortunately the folks aren't as friendly as Bob had hoped and when a freeloading neighbor and a gang of organ harvesting rednecks rain on his parade the s@#t hits the fan big time! The authorities the townsfolk and even his wife put Bob's manhood to the test....If Bob doesn't man up quick he's gonna die like a spineless coward!
