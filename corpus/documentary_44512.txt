A documentary of the legendary band of the eighties called CPg (Come on Punk group). CPg was one of the first Hungarian punk (not skinhead) groups. In the eyes of the political leadership they were the most reactionary and the rudest. Their songs sounded like a naive somewhat anarchistic social criticism but were never racists. They were sentenced to two years in prison.
