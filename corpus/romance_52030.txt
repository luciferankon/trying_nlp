A film about dating and relationships. It doesn't deal with the kind of head-over-heels knight-in-shining-armor love that is usually tied to "romance." This is the love that bores nags and sometimes even upsets you. The kind of love which can lead us to stray every once in a while but only to be welcomed back to its arms at just a single gesture of warmth. LOVERS OF 6 YEARS shows the real kind of love that countless relationship guides romance novels and films have come to neglect: the love that real people face in real life. This is what sets this film apart from its predecessors. By showing the honest truth about the kind of regular almost mundane love that real people experience it allows for the audience to truly relate to its characters and the everyday dating problems they face.
