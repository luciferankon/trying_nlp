Fourth year university student Sawada Takuto is having a tough time looking for a job. The eldest son of the director of a hospital Takuto's parents had expected him to become a doctor but they began to focus their hopes on his younger brother Rikuto instead some time during his junior high school. Although Takuto is popular and good at befriending ladies he has no confidence that he will be loved and thus avoids deep emotional involvement with anyone. One day he is informed that he does not have long to live because he is suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) an incurable progressive neurodegenerative disease. Takuto who had given only vague thoughts to his goals in life starts to explore what is left of his life and live with a positive attitude.
