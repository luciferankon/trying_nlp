The Hong Kong version of the popular quiz show. A group of contestants answer questions on a variety of subjects with the entire group being awarded cash for each correct answer. At the end of each round the group votes to remove one of the players ("The Weakest Link") until only two are left. These two then compete head-to-head to see who will go home with all the cash and who will go home with nothing.
