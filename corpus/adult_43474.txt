Ken then visits a bar in which his former girlfriend Liza works as an exotic dancer. Liza somehow gets both herself and Ken involved with the family's blind daughter Claire. Claire got blind on her sweet sixteen birthday when her mother "saved" her from her "seducing" boyfriend Louis by having sex with him herself. Meanwhile Lee Balcourt's secretary and mistress Barbara plans to steal Lee's framing business ledger. At the end Magda admits she wants Ken for more than writing. He only gives her half an effort though before revealing he got himself a copy of the ledger.
