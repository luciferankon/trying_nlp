After being voted "Best Unsigned Band in America" by CMJ the band landed on the Epic Record's album of "America's Best Unsigned Acts." With all the major label record companies keeping a watchful eye on The Reducers the four band members kept their focused on their music and their friendship. THE REDUCERS: America's Best Unsigned Band is the inspirational story of Hugh Birdsall Peter Detmold Steve Kaika and Tom Trombley as they continue their successful 28-year journey on the brink of fame where they often shared the stage with their more famous contemporaries like The Ramones and The Replacements who eventually crashed and burned. This is the story of one great rock & roll band that continues to do it their way with no regrets.
