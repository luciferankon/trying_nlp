In this unique interactive movie (you "play" as the lead character) viewers make choices and see the outcomes of those choices. The main character is a Soldier who deploys as the "money guy" to a war zone. He gets the call to move out and in two weeks finds himself on the ground in a remote corner of the world. What's more he has to purchase supplies from the local economy and do business to support a U.S. Army battalion in a war zone with no banking system. You've got an unarmored car no contacts and bags full of cash. What language do they speak here? What currency is used? What are the local customs? How will you deal with the bad guys vying for some of the action? Along the way the viewer makes choices that lead to different story paths. It concludes with a final major project - employing critical decision-making skills.
