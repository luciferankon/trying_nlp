Two students previously infatuated with each other meet up again years later at university. They agree to go out on a first date and initially everything seems to be fine. They meet friends at the pub have a meal and eventually end up at a party with no inkling of the problems ahead. Jamie after leaving Clare at her flat gets soaked in the rain soon after heading off and returns to Clare and begs for a place to stay the night. One thing leads to another and they spend the night together. The next day the recriminations start and Jamie is arrested for rape. At the trial two very different versions of the nights events emerge as seen through the differing eyes of Clare and Jamie. The court must decide if this was an innocent misunderstanding or a deliberate rape.
