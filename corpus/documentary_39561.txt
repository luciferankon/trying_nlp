New Trier's 2017 Seminar Day "Understanding Today's Struggle for Racial Civil Rights" has generated significant statewide controversy some national controversy - and virtually no controversy within New Trier Township. What gives? Who are these forces so opposed to this single day of educational programming? Are they really upset about Seminar Day - or could this be about something else entirely? Local filmmaker Paul Traynor inexplicably found himself deep inside the controversy surrounding Seminar Day 2017. See how his search for answers led to appearances on television and radio attacks from Christian hate groups and conservative shock-jocks being named in Freedom of Information Act requests filed at New Trier High School and being forced to cancel the Premiere the movie at the threat of a Cease and Desist letter from a downtown Chicago law firm representing anonymous shadowy clients. Public education is under attack in America. Dark money is being poured into local municipal elections. Billionaires governors and prominent figures are injecting themselves into a non-partisan race. It seems like a bizarre conspiracy theory - but it's happening. And New Trier is just the Tip of the Spear.
