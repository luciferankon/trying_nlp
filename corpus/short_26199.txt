FUYU NO TAWAMURE (winter playfulness) explores and celebrates our unconscious connections with our natural environment. We slide and travel across a mysterious landscape covered in fresh snow. The soft untouched forms glitter in the sunlight. We slide and move among the organic forms gently caressing touching the surface feeling the shapes hearing their breathing hearing our breathing. We forget where we came from and where we are going.
