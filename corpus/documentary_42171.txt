In 1907 Emile Kuntz's father left Alsace and a financially comfortable situation to emigrate to Joinville in southern Brazil. A few days after his arrival he tragically died. Almost a hundred years later Emile hardly knows more about the story but its mystery has been haunting him as much as Brazil fascinates him. He tells Regina about it: she is his friend and a Brazilian film-maker living in Alsace. She investigates in Brazil where she discovers a town heavily influenced by German culture. She starts knowing more about the circumstances of Emile's father's death and puts together the pieces of the family jigsaw puzzle.
