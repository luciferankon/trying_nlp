It has been three months since Rick escape from the West Mansion. Having been unable to save Jennifer he has had recurring dreams in which she begs him to come and rescue her. The mask from the mansion appears and promises that there is still a chance to save her. There is a downside to it though. Wearing the mask of terror Rick is flooded with feral rage and an insatiable hunger for blood. Heavily influenced by films such as Evil Dead 2 the game takes you through eight side-scrolling stages. Rick has a basic set of punches kicks and flying kicks but he can pick up additional weapons such as a lead pipes bones bombs a shotgun and a chainsaw for the ultimate bloodfest while fighting skulls razor fish and giant demons. A boss requiring a specific pattern of moves awaits you at the end of each stage.
