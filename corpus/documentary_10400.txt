Chasing Fortune follows the exploits of former INXS lead singer J.D. Fortune examining the roller coaster ride that was his past rock star life and the trials and tribulations of his present. Following J.D. across North America as he attempts to gain his lost stardom back the film uncovers many hidden - and surprising - facets of a man who is most certainly anything but a stereotype.
