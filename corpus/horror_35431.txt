Frightmares begins with "They're Alive" the story of a young art collector who adds some vintage mannequins to his collection. As dark falls it seems the mannequins have ghostly spirits trapped inside them causing them to speak and haunt the dreams of the young artist. But is he really dreaming? "Silent Night Evil Night" is a Christmas horror story about a father who wraps a mysterious gift under the tree commanding his son to stay away until "it's time." Finally "You or Me" tells the story of two school friends meeting by accident in the middle of the night. One offers his home to spend the night to the other but they each begin having nightmares that the other is trying to kill them...dreams and reality seem to intersect. The sheer creep factor of ongoing madness ensues throughout Frightmares.
