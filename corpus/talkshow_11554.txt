After shortly talking about his upcoming film _Baby Blue (2001)_ (qv) and the donation of hundreds of paintings and dozens of drawings of 'Vincent van Gogh' (qv) by his grandfather to the Dutch State (which means the family missed out on millions and millions of guilders) 'Inge Diepman' (qv) talks with Van Gogh about his columns. He explains to her that he simply writes what he feels what needs to be written and doesn't care about whether or not it is against Dutch law because he feels freedom of speech is unlimited. Film producer 'Matthijs van Heijningen' (qv) TV reviewer 'Ruud Verdonck' (qv) and publicist 'Martin Ros (I)' (qv) say they feel he has a lot of potential but doesn't fully reach it partly because he also makes a lot of terrible TV programs for commercial TV stations but also because the rather raw formulations in his columns to which a lot of people take offense make it easy to overlook the point Van Gogh is trying to make and hard to take his worries seriously. Later on Amsterdam politician 'Fatima Elatik' (qv) gossip magazine writer 'Barbara Plugge' (qv) and literature theorist Solange Leibovici are very critical about things Van Gogh has said in his columns and in TV shows about respectively the multicultural society themselves and the Holocaust. Elatik feels he shouldn't have made certain programs in which he jokes about female circumcision. Plugge talks about a column Van Gogh once wrote about her which hurt her so much she considered suing him while Leibovici says she feels Van Gogh is antisemitic because he feels people should be able to deny the Holocaust and because he has made some sick and hurtful jokes about Jews. Perhaps needless to say they don't exactly end up seeing eye to eye.
