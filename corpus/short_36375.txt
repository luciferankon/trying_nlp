I am 25 and i feel old. Not old but not young any more. There's always a memory between me and the present moment. And the memory is more beautyful. In transit in Paris Marc has an apointment with his friend Denis and ex-girl friend CÃ©cile. They haven't seen each other for a year. They spend the day together. Between them remembrance of their common past memories of their personal past views of their lifes and hopes. This is the birth of nostalgia.
