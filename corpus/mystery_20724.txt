Time Together a film in 14 episodes is set against the luscious backdrop of summertime Lithuania where a lost woman (Smilte Bagdziune) is befriended by a stranger (Monika Biciunaite) and lead through a series of ritual exercises towards the formation of a cult or political cell. The story is deeply mysterious yet the strangely compelling scenarios each with a cliffhanger leave the mind racing. What-if's on a cosmological scale.
