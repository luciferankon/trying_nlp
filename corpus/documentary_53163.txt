After 10 years of field investigation and 5 years of shooting we finally come up with this documentary. It reflects how local citizens have fallen into victims of increasingly deteriorated environment by focusing on the shrinkage of oasis and the expanding of deserts. With global warming being the general background this documentary reveals the complicated relationship between human being and Mother Nature and how for centuries human being have been attempting to seek ways to get along with Mother Nature.
