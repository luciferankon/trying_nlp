In the face of the gathering storms the world is awed by the creeping darkness above the horizon. We need one voice and one light to lead us back to the warmth tranquility and brightness of the right path. In these desperate times the Church has a choice - will it cling to old prejudice opinions and even hatred or shall it rise to the challenge and be that one voice and one light that we all crave for immensely. Remember your roots recollect your history face the schism and its ugly results all around us today and heed the voice of those who strive to make the right choice.
