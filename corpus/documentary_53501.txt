In this documentary crop and animal farmers in Quebec the Canadian West the US Northeast and France offer solutions to the social and environmental scourges of factory farming. Driven by the forces of globalization rampant agribusiness is harming the environment and threatening the survival of farms. The proliferation of GMO crops is a further threat to biodiversity as well as to farmers' autonomy. In Europe as well as North America a current of resistance bringing together farmers and consumers insists that it is possible-indeed imperative -to grow food differently. The Fight for True Farming is a film of grim lucidity but also irrepressible hope.
