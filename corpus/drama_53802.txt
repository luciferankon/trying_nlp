The title character Diamond Palladium narrates a perilous journey which is familiar to some known to a few but told by none. The story begins in the nineteen seventies when Palladium is born into total chaos and rescued by a strong woman. He embarks upon an odyssey which is all too natural in regards to his genetic coding but contrary to his moral home teachings. This serious life threatening life-loosing narrative gives a unique view into the actuality of clandestine events that take place subsequent to young adults leaving their parents nest. Experience the picturesque waterfront criminal campus in historic Virginia the raw sounds smells & mind state of the Jersey City & Newport News Street Ecosystem. An interesting thought provoking insight into the sociocultural theoretical perspective of urban youth.
