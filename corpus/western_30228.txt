He may have provided the background score but he didn't write the song. RKO's 1940 remake as "The Fargo Kid" with Tim Holt was played as much for the comedy elements found in W.C.Tuttles original pulp story"Sir Piegan Passes" as it was an action western as the always-loose Tim Holt the always-nervous Ernie Adams and the always-sweating Cy Kendall could handle it and the always-tight Tom Keene and always-stiff-as-a-board Alan Roscoe couldn't.
