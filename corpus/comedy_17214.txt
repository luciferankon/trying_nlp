2 years ago Cory Pickering left the YouTube group CherryBombIndustries for a short period of time because there was too much pressure being put onto him to complete a video to be featured in the World Wide Youtube Awards although he was never seen since. Now the competition is back but with a new featured channel The BRKN PYRMD in which CherryBombIndustries never even heard of. Soon they find out that a masked man has been brainwashing other YouTubers to work for him and gain him money. CherryBombIndustries then decides to take back these YouTubers and defeat the masked man in this hilarious crude (and wildly offensive) film that features people such as JonTron Markiplier the GameGrumps and more!
