The heroic Spartan king Leonidas armed with nothing but leather underwear and a cape leads a ragtag bunch of 13 Spartan misfit warriors to defend their homeland against thousands of invading Persians whom include the Ghost Rider Rocky Balboa the Autobots and an ugly hunchbacked Paris Hilton and a shaved-head Brittany Spears. Spartan king Leonidas may have been raised the same proverbially harsh way when it come to military training as he practices mercilessly on his own baby boy Leo in this low-budget Mel Brooks-type parody on 300 life in not so Ancient Sparta is mainly between idyllic and shamelessly orgiastic. When the Persian king of kings Xerxes demands 'just' slavish submission his emissaries are dumped in a near-bottomless pit so his vast army marches on Greece. After the dirty corrupt priests and oracle are bought they commend levying an army but predict glorious death to the last men. Only 13 men turn up from Leonidas's elite guard. The first battles are of the hip-hop variety and taking position at the narrow Thermopylae pass provides a huge strategic advantage but a goat trail back-door is betrayed to Xerxes. Back home true-to-his-name Traitoro sabotages vixen queen Margo's efforts including bribing him sexually to send a relief army.
