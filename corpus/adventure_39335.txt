Alexander Grant is no ordinary teenager. Sure he's got all the problems a typical 15-year-old faces-girl crushes raging hormones awkward mood swings-but Alexander is different. Not superhero different or alien from another planet different but chronologically different. You see he's one of less than a thousand people with a rare genetic defect: he ages only one day for every one hundred days. Of course with 1500 years of life experience comes some super ninja skills but when we catch up with Alexander he's been going to one high school or another for over 300 years and is about to take his 3000th history test.
