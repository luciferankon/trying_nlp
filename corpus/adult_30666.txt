After goodbye sex with lover BIlly (who fears losing Randy to the Hollywood lifestyle) Randy Marlow heads to Crawford Academy in California hoping for a bright future in the entertainment industry. Upon arrival he encounters his stark naked roommate Brian and notices that they must share a single bed together. He also makes an important contact that night at dinner (while Brian skips out for a tęte-ŕ-tęte with a nameless dude in their bed). Things move fast for Randy. Day #1 classes fill a few crevices between Randy and his dance and gym instructors but day #2 brings Randy work in his first adult film (making a debut so engaging that the cameraman stops to join in). Returning to Billy over break Randy's professional and personal futures look bright indeed.
