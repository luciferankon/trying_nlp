The National League All-Stars beat the American League All-Stars 5-4 in the 12th inning at Cincinnati Ohio's Riverfront Stadium on July 14 1970 when local boy 'Pete Rose' (qv) scored from second base on a single by Jim Hickman. The hustling Rose ran over American League catcher 'Ray Fosse' (qv) at home plate thus dislodging the ball and scoring the wining run.
