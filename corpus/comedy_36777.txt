As a high-end custom furniture maker Jimmy is trying to raise Wendy his smart yet manipulative 10-year-old daughter he has with Donna and his darkness-obsessed teen daughter Bonnie whom he had with his first wife a tart-tongued cocktail waitress Claire. Constantly trying to prove to all these women that he does indeed love them - despite his penchant for stupid hormonally-inspired remarks - things only become more complicated when Bonnie says she wants to live with him and Donna. Jimmy finally gets a break with the birth of his newest baby - it's a boy! Jimmy's joy over having an ally in the house is euphoric...even if father and son are still physically outnumbered - and more importantly psychologically outwitted.
