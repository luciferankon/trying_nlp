A TV series Truthfully Speaking is a half-hour sitcom drama about George Webb a man in his late 40s who speaks his mind no matter the consequences. George's conservative views are often controversial rarely backing down from his POV. A cross between Archie Bunker and Ralph Kramden George seldom shows his endearing side letting the obnoxious side dominate and harass co-workers and long-suffering chatter box wife Sarah.
