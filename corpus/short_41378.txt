In the wake of World War II hundreds of mixed race children were born and abandoned. These orphans were the offspring of black foreign servicemen and white European women who had met during the war. After the war their fathers were shipped back home and their mothers were not willing to bear the burden of raising a non-white child in a country where racism was still prevalent. Journey of Ten documents the experiences of a group of these orphans who were raised in a missionary orphanage near Vienna Austria. The film presents interviews featuring their varied perspectives as well as the perspectives of the missionary couple that eventually adopted the group of orphans and brought them back to America. Supported with photos and home movies that span their childhood the film explores the joys they had in growing up together the tragedy they felt in the death of one of their siblings and the adversity of racism that they overcame in Austria during the 1950's and 60's. The story follows them back to America and delves into how they adapted to their new life in a new land. All in all the film tells an incredible story of hope from the perspective of the orphans and an amazing story of self-sacrifice from the perspective of the couple that adopted them.
