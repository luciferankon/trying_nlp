In "Heart of a Champion" Calvin Malone and Malcolm Saint are two men who have lost their way and lost sight on the values taught through the disciplines of the boxing ring. With a younger generation looking on the two are destined to set off a chain of events that through their example threaten to tear this small community apart. With the help of an old sage Granger and a seasoned veteran of the ring Big Mac the two are asked to put the past and their differences aside and look to the future. As bad blood begins to flow from old wounds it seems the only way to bring their conflict to an end is where it began in the squared circle.
