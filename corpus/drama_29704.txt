Salt of the earth Queensland plantation owner Eric Westbrook collects at the station Adam his recently deceased brother's young son who didn't speak since the fatal accident. Joanna Williams who came from England to explore the unspecified aboriginal land her grandparents were missionaries in and her late parents did biological research in agrees to help the boy settle in until Eric can make time to help her explore. Eric's spoiled-rotten fianc√©e Pauline Downs fails to bond with Adam and senses a rival in Joanna who also sets herself up as nurse and grower of pharmaceutical plants. The aboriginal elder discerned a dream world curse on Joanna which seems to come true for her companions over and over.
