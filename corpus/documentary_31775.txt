State of Para in the south part of the Brazilian Amazon. Hundreds of settlers are moving to this state hoping they will find a better life there. But most of the time they are trapped into large beef cow farms and treated like slaves. In this state known as the most violent area in Brazil in terms of agrarian conflicts Henri Burin des Roziers Catholic priest and lawyer fights for the landless workers at the risk of his own life. Since 1978 he has organised the struggle against hard labour with the Pastoral Land Commission set up by the Catholic Church. Even if he is considered "the man to kill" by the large farmers this firmly confident and courageous 77 years old man is not afraid of dying. The Brazilian government admits now that slavery practices exist on its territory and they intensify the fight to eradicate them. Since 1995 due to regular labour inspectors' raids about 20000 workers have been liberated. Through the story of Henri Burin des Roziers and the testimonies of some large farmers and exploited workers St√©phane Brasey depicts a land of wealth violence and illusions.
