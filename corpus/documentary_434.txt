During the 1990s Thomas Quick confessed to one unsolved murder after another becoming in the words of the father of one of his alleged victims "a ghost who ran through Scandinavia killing more than 30 people". The sadistic murderer was a media sensation and his bespectacled face stared out from front pages and television screens. The newspapers called him "the cannibal". Thomas Quick became Sweden's very own Hannibal Lecter. He was very keen on confessing sexual abuse rape and murder of teenage boys. He read about these violent and repulsive crimes in newspapers and made them his own.
