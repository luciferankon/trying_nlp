Architect Aoife McKenna inherits an Irish pub but when she attempts to renovate the place the locals put up resistance. Aoife's eagerness to succeed reveals a secret with profound consequences. Fiddler's Walk is the journey of a young woman stepping away from the hurley burley of modern America and finding herself in the depths of post-troubles Ireland where new world commercialism collides with old world community values. Fiddler's Walk is shot in the beautiful landscapes of South Armagh County Down and County Louth in contemporary Ireland.
