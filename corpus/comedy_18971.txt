Father Daniel Cleary was a very conservative priest who was paired up with a down-to-earth liberal-leaning nun Sister Agnes to open a mission in Baltimore. Their disparate backgrounds and philosophies led to a number of misunderstandings and arguments--in fact Father Cleary kept trying to get transferred to a more stable environment--but they managed to work together for the sake of their penitents. Sister Lillian and Monsignor Barlow were their superiors who were often forced to settle their disagreements.
