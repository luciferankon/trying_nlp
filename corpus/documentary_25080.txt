MY BRAND NEW FACE documents the struggles and accomplishments of two courageous men determined to change their lives. Maurice Simpson lives comfortably in a small town with his wife and children but something about Maurice sets him apart from everybody else. Since childhood he's been disfigured by massive facial tumors caused by Neurofibromatosis. Amazingly an anonymous donor has offered to pay for facial reconstructive surgery. But first Maurice wants to meet Reggie Bibbs another NF sufferer fighting for the confidence to face the world. Surgery to remove Maurice's tumors will put his life on the line - all for his brand new face.
