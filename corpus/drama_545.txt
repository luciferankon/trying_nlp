Greedy an unapologetic unaccountable narcissistic street hustler cares for nothing and no one besides himself. He lives on the edge and is unconcerned of who he affects or offends because in his mind this is his world and he's invincible in it. However that all comes crashing down once he's made aware of some news that will forever change his life and the lives of those around him. Unable to cope and assume responsibility Greedy goes on a whirlwind path of self-destruction determined to punish those he feels have punished him instead of looking in the mirror and accepting that he's the culprit of this circle and its chain events.
