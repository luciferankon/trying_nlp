Freddy started 'Vampires Anonymous' to remain undetected. At 'VA' vampires receive support managing their addiction to blood and keep their slaughter rates to a minimum so keeping the authorities unaware of their existence. However some vampires are weaker than others and when they fall off the wagon all "bloody" hell is let loose.
