An italian professor tries a scam over an Arabian country to pull some money from them. He basically shows "proofs" that a lot of oil will soon be available all over the world (just digging deeper) and hence the 70s "big names" in oil and OPEC itself may soon lose their power and incomes. He gets some of the money but the Arabic Secret Services are after him and possibly his friends (and soon CIA gets involved too). People are killed and the chase becomes quite involving and some interesting characters show up... towards a nice ending!
