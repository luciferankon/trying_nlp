Angela a 14 year old girl switches on a video-camera and starts recording herself. Her first words are: "I am Angela. There are certain things I wish to share with you". Along several months filming her Angela shares with the camera her reflections about the things she finds more disappointing and frustrating as well as those events more uplifting or with potential of transformation. We will also escort her to the Huarte Centre for Contemporary Arts in order to reflect about the impact of the artistic vanguards on the evolution of the youngest generations' culture. And we will visit also the Basque city of Gernika in order to meditate about the influence of our collective past in current developments.
