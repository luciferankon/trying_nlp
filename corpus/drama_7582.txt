A cranky high school student cons his friends into helping him with a propaganda blitz against the school administration which results in a student body riot and the inevitable moral lesson... all set to a trance-hop soundtrack. Four teenagers in a suburban Chicago High School called New Port South decide to shake things up by using the example set by a recently escaped psycho named Stanton. Stanton attended New Port South 2 years earlier and punched through 55 windows in the school (as well as other acts) thus getting himself committed. The teenagers get more to join them and begin plastering the school with propaganda and causing major problems for the teachers. What results is a revolution lead by Maddux (a male junior at the school). But they may have gone too far...
