Indian Summer is an entertaining road movie that travels through South India to discover Ayurvedic medicine a five thousand year old traditional medicine which may represent new hope in the fight against the endemic pathologies of the 21st century and against cancer in particular. The film follows the journey of a surprising and unusual couple: a world famous French oncologist both intrigued and questioning who has the desire to discover other medical approaches and to question his own knowledge and one of his former patients a patient who chose traditional Indian medicine instead of following his recommended treatment and who joins him in retracing her personal path against cancer that had a happy ending. Two out-of-the-ordinary characters for a "medical comedy" which speaks in a new and original way both serious and profound yet funny and entertaining about one our most universal concerns: illness.
