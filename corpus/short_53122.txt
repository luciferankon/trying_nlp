A long long night has come. It will continue for a thousand years. With the arrival of night thick ice begins to cover the ground. Soon life is born under the thick ice layer. Then the first living creatures appear at the northern ocean. A long saga of their evolution starts. Myth comes into the world. Legend follows it. Science overtakes them. They flourish under the icy ocean. As night deepens and dawn comes closer the ground temperature begins to rise. With the arrival of morning at last the long night comes to the end. Then a thousand years of day will begin. As the sun rises higher the thick ice covering their world will begin to melt. For the long long daytime the world will boil and soon everything will evaporate. The world where prophet magician and messiah are everywhere. The world where doubt and fears dominate. Fighting for the left resources we must depart before everything comes to the end. One after another huge ships go up to the sky with chaos behind. After they leave only silence remains. Then night will come again. A long long night for a thousand years.
