Somewhere on the road two mature people meet. She is an archaeologist and he is a successful engineer. Seventeen years earlier they had a brief but tempestuous love affair. That happened straight after the war: the time of big construction projects of fervent enthusiasm and faith in future. Wishing to dedicate themselves entirely to the service of society they have renounced personal happiness considering their love as an impermissible sidetrack from the requirements of the time. Now after all this time they are reviving the memory of the tiny garret room of the short-lived feelings which they have sacrificed. While they are 'sidetracked' again from the daily routine of their cares and responsibilities they come to realize that noble goals and aspirations are not incompatible with love - the greatest emotional asset of man.
