What could be better for our main character Al than to have his house all to himself on a lazy Sunday afternoon to watch football all day while consuming as much beer as humanly possible? Nothing! But all that will fade away as his nagging wife Flo returns home unexpectedly to spoil his fun. However Al can only take so much from the love of his life as he proceeds to dream up a way to have her sidelined while keeping himself in the game. It's a nasty little love story but it all works out in the end.
