MORTUARY MASSACRE is a gruesome Horror Anthology that centers around Detective Giger's (Todd Brown) debriefing of several mysterious deaths all taking place on Halloween night. The local mortician (Carl Crew) tells Giger the backstories behind three particular victims each of them filled with plenty of gore sex and the kind of tongue-in-cheek humor that will please fans of grindhouse splatterpunk horror.
