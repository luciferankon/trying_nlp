What are the women friendship songs one can remember in Indian cinema? To see three women friends in a film having a good time without a love angle song or a villain has not been explored by mainstream film makers yet. We are still into male bonding films but what about women? What kind of friendships do they share? What are their dreams and aspirations? How do they support each other to get there? In the cosmopolitan city of Hyderabad in South India three girls; Nidhi Vaijanti and Trisha meet for a film appreciation course and become friends. Each girl has a story to tell. The underlying emotions of fears desires aspirations and well kept secrets are a part of their stories.
