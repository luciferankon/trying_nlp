Like a program settled robotic machine she has a regular daily routine lifestyle.One day when Alice awakens after a surgery operation she becomes a 30-year-old woman but has no memory of the 17 years that have passed. All right. She thinks. It's not a big deal to back to a 17 year-old girl with the past 13 year's memory erased. Back to 17 she returns to say everything yes like a garbage truck to absorb people's bad emotion dumping. She asks for help from her close friend but she realizes she has lost almost all contact with her parents and colleague. She is generally hated by her co-workers and friend. Now no one would help her to catch up on the 17 years she doesn't remember. Alice has to find the reason why she hated by people around her and make up the broken relationship with her first love.
