A black comedy about the two things you can't avoid even the second time around. Harold Hoptuit mysteriously returns from the dead on the day his widow is getting engaged to the plastic surgeon who did her breast reductions. In this funny social satire an ingenuous Harold will find that life can mean especially when your skin is gray.
