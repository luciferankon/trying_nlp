A group of friends go on a vacation in Phuket after their high school graduation. They build their tents next to the beach but unfortunately for them a huge storm forces them to move indoors into a nearby hotel. They decide to sleep at the hotel for the night. However they are all woken up by the same horrible dream of a Tsunami disaster. A gruesome sight greets them as they open their eyes; the hotel is filled with wrapped dead bodies. They crawl through the dead bodies hoping to escape from the hotel.
