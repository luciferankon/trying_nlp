Nacho Bear and his raccoon pal are at a hot springs in....hum maybe Arkansas? There is a glorified Nacho Chip in one of the holes. Nacho Bear can't get the chip out since it disappears in this hole after popping out via the emergence of geothermic heated groundwater from the Earth's crust. Finally Nacho Bear gets the chip after chasing it through lots of holes in which it popped out but it seems Nacho Bear can't get his butt out of a hole. Raccoon tries to help but it doesn't work and it's too late. BOOM goes the hot spring hole blasting them both to China(after the camera turns right-side-up) at the same hot springs now with Nacho Panda and his raccoon pal discovering a glorified Nacho Rice Cake. BOOM goes the earth around the rice cake revealing Nacho Bear and Raccoon. They all fall in the hole trying to catch their glorified nacho snacks.
