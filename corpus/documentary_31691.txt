The Bones Speak focuses on a 2006 archaeological discovery in an area of lower Manhattan in New York City that uncovered long-forgotten early 19th century burial vaults belonging to the former abolitionist and integrated Spring Street Presbyterian Church. The discovery highlights not only the considerable amount of scientific study of the remains found at the spot but at the same time highlights the church's forgotten history as an early anti-slavery and integrated congregation that was nearly destroyed in the infamous anti-abolitionist riots of 1834.
