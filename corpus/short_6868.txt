The surrealist short film is paying homage to the great auteurs of cinema from Eisenstein to Fellini while facing the struggles of an unconventional and grotesque love story.In the movie filled with biblical symbols the music is the real protagonist as the songs employed combine the plot to an original and distinguished style. Although it may seem to convey a critical perspective about the Church the film is not related with the concept of religion at all as it metaphorically addresses the themes of "faith" and "spiritual crisis" to the extent of transmitting a message of freedom and thus surrealism.
