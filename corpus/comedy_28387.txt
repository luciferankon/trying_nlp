Accidental Babe was shot on 16mm film in 1993 but was never finished. In 2009 the film's original negative was transferred to High Definition and finished with Apple's Final Cut Studio. The film's nostalgic look juxtaposed with current LGBT themes gives the film a very surreal tone. Music composer Giuseppe Vasapolli scored the film in the style of 1960's Lounge music... very cool very hip.
