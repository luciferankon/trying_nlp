Are you ready for something new? Do you like TV shows and movies like "The Soprano's"? Do you remember the guys eating at Satriale's Artie Bucco's restaurant? Do you remember Big Paulie teaching the guys how to cut garlic in "Goodfellas"? What about Clemenza teaching Michael (Al Pacino) how to make tomato sauce? If you enjoy cooking shows like Emeril  Mario or Gordon or just love a great recipe then get ready for "The Wiseguy Kitchen" a fun-filled cooking show hosted by Vincent Fiore. Join Vincent each week as he takes you out to visit local grocers butchers fish mongers specialty cheese shops and all of his favorite hangouts! Finally hang on to your apron strings and head back to Vinny's kitchen and learn how to prepare a great meal Wiseguy-style.
