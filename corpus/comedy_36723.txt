This dark comedy is a tribute to anyone who grew up in the nineties; Best friends X and Numby are drug dealers in a place that you might not expect. Yup you got in a club bathroom; but not an ordinary club bathroom. This is a unisex bathroom with couches bars and people just hanging out. To entertain themselves X and Numby converse about all the stereotypical people of the nineties that they run into along with witty off the wall conversations of sex television and cartoons. As the night goes on X divulges that it's going to be his last night dealing. Numby instantly knows that it is not X who is actually saying these words; It's his manipulative girlfriend Liz. Will Liz make it X's last night? Or will the authorities intervene and make it the last night for these best friends?
