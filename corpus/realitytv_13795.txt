A $100000 prize is on the line for seven pairs of former BFFs in this competition series that forces them to put past differences behind them to have a shot at winning the life-changing prize. The duos compete in a series of challenges. If a team loses a challenge its members have the choice to compete for $50000 or leave the competition. Losing two consecutive challenges gets rid of that option and results in immediate elimination. It is up to the contestants to determine if the potential payout is worth the betrayals lies and past accusations they have to put up with while working with their former friends.
