A mockumentary film that chronicles the journey of three production teams as they vie for a studio slot made possible by the untimely (or timely) death of Walt Guggenheim a college friend and ex-business partner. The first group "Dangerous 3Some Productions" quickly goes to work on their latest gem an action movie called "Double Dynamite". The second group "Pax Cinema" prepares their overly artsy biographical film-poem entitled "Soy Identities". The third group "Leonard Atwater Productions" pulls together their latest idea from a focus group called "Hot Wacky Blood: The Love Apocalypse". A documentary crew follows these three misfit companies as they create their ideas cast film trailers and eventually pitch them.
