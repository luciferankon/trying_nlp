A look at ice cream exploring its origins in Italy its journey from towns like Zoldo to the rest of Europe its shift from being a treat for kids to a staple for all (thanks in part to advertising) and the origins and success of HÃ¤agen-Dazs and Ben and Jerry's. Robin Weir an English chemist turned ice cream historian provides comment (on the first sorbet in 1650 the first cones - not invented at a World's Fair and the health problems of 19th century sales) and there's enthusiasm from long-time gelato maker Corrado Brustolon and from the Minghella family immigrants who took gelato to the Isle of Wight.
