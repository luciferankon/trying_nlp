It all started with a small misunderstanding. A young journalist writes a feuilleton and submits it to the editor-in-chief together with a request for a leave of absence. The editor wants to grant his permission for leave of absence and to reject the feuilleton but a mistake occurs and the short story is being published in the newspaper. The satire on the fictional protagonist is taken literally and many people are offended. They place the editorial offices under siege and request the journalist's resignation. Just before he is dismissed it turns out that the superiors have liked his feuilleton. The intruders are driven back.
