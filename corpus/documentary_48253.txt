Every year in Spain some 16000 Fiestas are organized during which animals are used. Honoring the Holy Virgin and the Patron Saints and with the blessing of religious and political authorities entire towns -including children- are involved in celebrations of unbelievable cruelty. 60000 animals are hence abused each year during these "Fiestas of Blood". Toros Embolados (bulls with two burning pikes soaked with fuel tied to their horns) stabbed tied pierced with darts or thrown into the water. Abused pigeons rats pigs geese horses and even ants. The barbaric tradition is varied and extends throughout the Spanish geography. People dance drink laugh. The life of the people and the death of the animals is celebrated with the silent complicity of priests amongst prayers and mystical processions. Santa Fiesta is a feature documentary that makes us eyewitnesses of a cocktail of celebration blood and faith rooted in the Spanish soul. A journey of images sounds colors and emotions during which we experience firsthand the Holy Fiesta.
