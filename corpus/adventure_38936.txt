An adventure movie set in a medieval Rajput court mainly addresses Rajput notions of chivalry. The legendary warrior Mansingh (Phatak) is the nation's strong man but he is cordially hated even by his own people. Claiming to have been offended by Taramati (Tarkhad) he insists to her eminent father only a marriage (on terms insulting to her) can placate him. He becomes a tyrant imprisoning large numbers of people and eventually Taramati's father also in prison leads a popular revolt threatening to kill his son-in-law.
