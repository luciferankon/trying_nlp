Grace wasn't always a whore. Like a lot of us she was two missed paychecks away from ruin. The recession hit her and her husband hard. Their depression led to drug addiction. The addiction lead to the husband's death and Grace turning to prostitution to maintain the drugs. Now her life was a surreal hell. Her estranged sister (fighting demons of her own) comes to the rescue. But can she save Grace? Does Grace really want to be saved?
