'(k)now (t)here' is a film diary about series of journeys of summer 2009 that was simply to be 'on the road'. No certain destinations moving with one-way-tickets being surrounded by strangers... Continuous packing and unpacking almost daily check in and out even in the same town to taste different flavors of it... Throbs of excitement and anxiety and unusually wide-open perception in consequence of putting myself in every possible mysterious moment... Myself became emerged by being anonymous like subtle sound got amplified in complete silence or dim light grew conspicuous in total darkness.
