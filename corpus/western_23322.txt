An evil ranch foreman tries to provoke a range war by playing two cattlemen against each other while helping a gang to rustle the cattle. Each cattleman blames the other for missing cattle. With the help of Bill Cassidy (Hop-along because of an earlier bullet wound) and Johnny Nelson the warring cattlemen join forces to do in the outlaws. In the first of the 66 Hopalong Cassidys a range war has developed between the Bar 20 and their neighbor with each thinking their cattle is being rustled by the other. Having been shot in the fracas Bill Cassidy recieves his nickname recuperating from the leg wound when he says 'I can still hop along'. Later he uses an altered cowhide brand to find the real rustlers.
