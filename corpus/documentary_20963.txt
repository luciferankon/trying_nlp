Since pre-Hispanic times Mexico is and has been many Mexico's. Nevertheless for more than a hundred years the nation's governments tried to subsume that variegated linguistic and cultural diversity under the dominant Western pattern which is both racially diverse on the one hand and strictly Spanish-speaking on the other. Today an ambitious project of Intercultural Bilingual Education is on the road to rescuing languages ideas and expressions of all of those groups that are culturally different and that in forming part of the country contribute to its enrichment as they face the challenges of modernity without losing the essence of its multiple origins.
