'The Life of Insects' will be a dark comedy based on the novel by Russian author Victor Pelevin. The film consists of parallel strorylines in the tradition of P.T. Anderson's 'Magnoila' creating a portrait of a time and place that is larger than the sum of it's parts. Set in a crumbling Crimean resort shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union the story examines how people try to cope when the seemingly permanent features of their world fall apart.
