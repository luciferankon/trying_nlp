Mr. Digit explains the to the public the impending change to all-number calling in this 1961 film starring the then-well-known radio and television team Peg Lynch and Alan Bunce ("Ethel and Albert"). They portray a couple coming home from vacation to find their time-honored telephone number "Bubbling Brook 3-2468" is being changed to seven numerals. Ethel is naturally upset to be losing her identity. Mr. Digit a character created by former Disney animator Chuck Couch is featured in the animated portion of the film as the tutor from the telephone company. He explains the new numbering system to Ethel and shows that "we're running out of numbers under our present numbering system." He discusses some expected communications services of the future and the necessity of all-number calling to make improvements in present services as well as those expected to come. Ethel finds the change isn't as radical as she thought and "she might like it at that."
