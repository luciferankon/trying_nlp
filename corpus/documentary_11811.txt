In a few years the mining industry has turned the impoverished region of Yulin into China's own little Klondike or Kuwait. People stream like the possessed from far away to the mines to start just one kind of coal-related business or another and to realise their dream of overnight wealth. Most of them have to face up to the fact that it wasn't a short cut to a happy life. On the contrary the mines collapse around the people without any consequences for those responsible. In three chapters with a different narrative strategy in each the documentary couple Li Xiaofeng and Jia Kai decipher the social mechanisms behind the Chinese coal rush and its human costs and thereby gives us a better look at where the planet's new superpower is heading than many reports in the evening news.
