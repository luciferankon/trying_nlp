Twisted Puppet Theatre was a cult hit that ran for 13 episodes in the summer of July 1996. It was a hilarious fast paced variety show that was a hybrid of R rated humor and sketches (a la Saturday Night Live) performed by various puppets muppets marionettes sock puppets shadow puppets and stick puppets. It aired as part of a late night comedy block that also included the series Sherman Oaks and Howie Mandel's Sunny Skies.
