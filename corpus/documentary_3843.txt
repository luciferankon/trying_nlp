During World War I African-Americans worked on the railroad near Corbin Kentucky. When whites returned from the war there was conflict. Whites sought their former jobs and positions in the community. In 1919 a race riot occurred. Whites put the African-Americans on railroad cars and ran them out of town. In Trouble Behind members of the Corbin community speak out on the issue. The filmmakers also interview former members of the Corbin which at the time of filming had only one black family. Some Corbin residents express confusion as to why African-Americans don't move back. Others openly use racial epithets. Some young adults seem troubled by the racism past and present. Others don't.
