George Tully owns a ranch and his ranch hands are his outlaw gang. Jack Loomis arrives and Tully gives him the job of foreman. When Jack breaks up a Express Office holdup by Tully's men they frame him for the robbery. Escaping from the Marshal he rejoins up with Tully. They then make plans to have him blamed for their next big job while he makes plans to capture them and prove they are the robbers. Grey Wolf and Red Cloud head for town with their bullion sacks and are held up by outlaws a short distance from their one-teepee village but are rescued by wandering cowhand Jack Loomis. Jack goes to town and stops at the general store to buy a new neckerchief and is waited on by Madge Harron and a flirtation breaks out which is broken up by the arrival of express agent Ray Keeler whose jealousy leads him to pick a fight with Jack. Jack knocks him down and Keeler departs vowing vengeance. Jack makes a date to meet Madge that night after the store closes and as he passes the express office sees two men rifling the safe and engages them in a fight. They escape but the noise brings a crowd including old storekeeper Elmer Harron who doubles as the town Marshal. Keeler is tied up and gagged and when he is set free he accuses Jack of having assaulted him and robbed the safe. He escapes before Harron can jail him. He seeks refuge in the Indian village but is trailed by rancher George Tully and his motley crew. Tully is the man behind the gang that has been terrorizing the territory for some time and he tells Jack that as long as he is already wanted by the law he might as well make the best of it and join his gang. Jack consents. He finds out that Keeler is working with the outlaws and Jack sends word to his Indian friends to aid him in stopping a big haul Tully has planned for the next day. But before they and the town posse can get to the Tully ranch Jack is under mass attack by Tully Ray and the gang.
