John Waters' second film shot on 8mm and featuring Divine for the first time. Essentially a plotless collage of random incidents involving sex drugs religion and 'The Wizard of Oz' it was shown with an equally random soundtrack mixing 'obnoxious radio advertisements rock'n'roll and press conferences with Lee Harvey Oswald's mother'. It was shown three times in public but never released commercially.
