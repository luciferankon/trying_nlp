Marco Polo knows they're coming to get him but his police protectors are more interested in late night snacks than in watching his back. He isn't testifying to name names he just wants to come clean. But his former employers aren't convinced and they send his protégé to rub him out. Marco used to be a hit man one of the best. He hasn't exactly found God but he knows 'thou shalt not kill' is a good place to start. He hopes a confession will buy him mercy. He'll have to convince his would-be killer that he not only plans to change but deserves the chance. Unfortunately his first lesson was the inviolability of a contract.
