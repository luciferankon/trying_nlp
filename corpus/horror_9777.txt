The Sharma family re-locate to a semi-urban locality in a house that has a "reputation". The Sharma family consists of Mr. Sharma (Akash Khurana) his wife Shalini Sharma (Rohini Hattangadi) only daughter Manisha Sharma (Revathi) or "Mini" as they affectionately call her; and their grandchild Bunty (Master Ateet) as his parents had been killed in an accident. Strange things start happening with a return of a dead kitten and the brutal murder of Manisha's friend Reshmi (Jaya Mathur); an attempt to kill Mr. Sharma and Manisha's boyfriend Deepak (Kushant). What is the force behind these brutalities? Is it natural or supernatural?
