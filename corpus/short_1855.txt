Shadow and Queen meet every night after midnight. Outside a poorly maintained warehouse in Greenpoint on the banks of the East river they drink cans of Modelo and smoke weed and dream about what they wanna do when they grow up. They don't know each other's real names or where each other lives or what each other does before sun-down. But maybe out of loneliness or a lack of sobriety they start to fall in love and wrestle with the 'rules' of the game they're playing.
