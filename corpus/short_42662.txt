We journey the world of questions with the birth of a child which knows no wrong or fears. Born in a crib of innocence slowly the world shapes us into monsters or classify as us its success or failure with its many questions. We follow the child from the womb to to its horrid awakening of a dream which reduces it to tears. A calm before the storm which awaits it.
