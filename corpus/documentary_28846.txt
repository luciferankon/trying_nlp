HEARTS of TANGO is a documentary film produced in Toronto Canada. It describes the "tanguero" landscape of the city giving voice to different players of the local scene who share their passion for this multicultural expression of life. It includes students and instructors musicians DJ's performance dancers "Milongas" and special events organizers. Searching for answers to what the Tango means to them the documentary asks: What is its universal attraction? What awakens them to this passion? What makes them live it so intensely and how do they find expression in it? HEARTS of TANGO also seeks to demonstrate that the typical sound of this music does not belong only to the city of Buenos Aires but it is somehow connected to the concept of the city itself through the memory of its past history and identified in its architecture. In the same way we try on new clothes to see how they fit this documentary tries on Tango music on the city of Toronto thus depicting how this new colour and vibrancy fits into its multicultural mosaic. Finally HEARTS of TANGO makes a full conceptual circle when connecting the origins of this music to a key piece of Canadian identity: its immigrants. Tango was a result and product of musical traditions brought to South America by different immigration waves during the first decades of the 20th Century. Now the time has come to explore its migration to Toronto. In the words of its poetry in each step of its dance and each note of its music Tango speaks of love and passion sadness and longing and loss and hope. Milonga: noun. Both a dance hall where Tango is danced and also a Tango dance with a faster rhythm.
