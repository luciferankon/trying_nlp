Author driven documentary "What we leave behind" (original "Liebe Oma Guten Tag!") is made from a need to talk in unspoken topics look for answers and hopefully break taboos. It is a film where two sisters from Lithuania - a filmmaker and a photographer - take a journey through their German grandmother's past. During the research authors encounter her love story fleeing uncomfort of being German in Soviet Lithuania and chain of suicides in their family. It's time to talk. About everything. Long journey which leads in two directions - towards other person and yourself.
