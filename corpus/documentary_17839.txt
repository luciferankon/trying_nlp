Renowned soprano Measha Brueggergosman explores and sings popular songs that have emerged from Africa via the slave trade to America then to Canada via the Underground Railroad. Measha leads us on a personal journey from Maritime Canada - where her family has lived for more than 200 years - to Cameroon where her ancestors were sold as slaves and shipped to America in the 1700's. This journey back and forth through time and space is musical and sociological personal and historical intimate and epic - as Measha explores the role of music throughout these turbulent chapters in North American history.
