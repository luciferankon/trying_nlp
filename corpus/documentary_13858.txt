In the beginning of the 1950's the Israeli society started to try and overcome the cruelty loss and treason that European Jews had to endure. Even though the young country fought for its existence they still decided they would not forget the people who stood by the European Jews in their darkest hours. In 1963 the Memorial started another worldwide program to find and honour those who had helped save Jews and calls them "The Righteous Among Nations". By telling the exceptional story of the Helmrich couple Jaroslava Lewickiand and Esther Grinberg-Boissevains we want to show that it is possible even under the worst of circumstances to show compassion and care for those in need. With this we want to commemorate the "Silent Helpers". They are the proof that there was an alternative. The Yad Vashem has honoured 24.811 "Righteous" until today and every year more join. Still the stories of these people are quite unknown. This documentary wants to tell these stories of courage and effort and want to remind us of "The Righteous Among the Nations" Yad Vashem is the most significant memorial of the Holocaust. The impressive documentation centre has next to the scientific reprocessing of the cruelty of the National Socialism set itself the task to honour the people who helped and rescued Jews by giving them the title "The Righteous Among the Nations".
