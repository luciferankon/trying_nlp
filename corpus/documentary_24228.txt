notes to eternity is a meditation on the Israel-Palestine conflict centering on the lives and ideas of four renowned critics of Israel: Noam Chomsky Sara Roy Norman Finkelstein and Robert Fisk. All four have strong personal connections to the issue that traverse and transcend historical and cultural lines. Filmed over a number of years in the Middle East the United States and the United Kingdom the film becomes an exploration of the very act of representing injustice suffered by another and a testament to the realities of dispossession that reverberate through all narratives of colonization and forced displacement.
