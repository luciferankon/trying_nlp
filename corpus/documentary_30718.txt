Using Khmer Rouge Tribunal as a starting point Susanne Brandstätter takes a deep look into the lives of young Cambodians on the brink of adulthood. As the trial accusing a perpetrator of the Pol Pot regime progresses it becomes a catalyst for a new generation of Cambodians questioning their parents families and neighbors about the inhumanities their nation has suffered. Brandstätter accompanies three families on two different continents - two Cambodian families and an immigrated Cambodian family in Paris France - recognizing that the truth is only to be found among those who survived and that the past can best be questioned by those who are about to build a future.
