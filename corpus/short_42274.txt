This picture is not only very dramatic in its action but it has an especial interest in that the soldiers are of the famous regiment of Gordon Highlanders the heroes of many a hard fought battle in India Egypt and South Africa. At the opening of the picture what appears to be a deserted camp is seen. A mounted messenger rides in with an alarm the bugle is sounded and in an instant the Highlanders pour forth from their tents fall in at the command of their officers and rush off to the fray.
