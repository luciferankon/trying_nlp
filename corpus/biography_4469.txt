Two people return to the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa. Giulia overcame a personal crisis here Zakaria fled here from the civil war in his homeland of Somalia. Schreiner tells about them about innermost thoughts existential questions and fears about transiency: A search for meaning that remains fragmentary moving between memory and now. The past presses into the monologues and conversations in the present of the cinematic image. It has written itself visibly into the skin faces and bodies that Schreiner explores in close ups which become practically perceptible yet nonetheless remain highly artificial. The strict sensual beauty of these images the play with abstraction of brilliant black-and-white of light and shadow the long calm takes the concentration on details all create the space for an intuitive concentrated awareness a space of encounter. The site of this encounter is concrete but for the characters the sparse brittle landscape of Lampedusa turns into a stage of sorts and a projection; an abstract space. Just as this island exists as a mere idea for most of us as a place where political action becomes manifest and also a crisis-the relationship of old Europe and young Africa the dynamics of resistance and mesmerized attraction of inside and outside. Schreiner drafts Lampedusa as a universal internal narrative as intense space of experience and association oscillating between documentary and fictional elements. Freed of the necessity to explain the film itself becomes a search and interrogation-of the characters cinematic form and our own present realities. A woman a man. The island of Lampedusa where their escape routes intersect. Zakaria in his late twenties from Somalia who has risked his life coming to the island on a small boat when fleeing civil war in his country. Giulia in her mid-fifties a tourist from Northern Italy on the run from deep personal crises. Both have returned to the island.
