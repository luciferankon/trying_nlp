Preserving our Waters takes a look at the 50-year history of the Estero Bay Aquatic Preserve and the people behind the efforts to establish it as the first estuarine preserve in Florida. The 30-min documentary explores how these actions were the blueprint for the Florida Aquatic Preserve Act of 1975 and the statewide aquatic preserve system. Produced for WGCU Public Media by award-winning producer Tom James the film examines the delicate balance between development and maintaining the integrity of an estuary. Funded in part by the Florida Humanities Council/National Endowment for the Arts the documentary also addresses the state of the preserve's water quality today and the groups who are working to continue its preservation in increasingly challenging times. As issues with Lake Okeechobee a growing regional population and potential sea level rise pose challenges for the next 50 years what will it take to preserve our waters?
