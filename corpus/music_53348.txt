The grandest of grand operas and a brilliant balance of spectacular pageantry and emotional intimacy. A bitter love triangle plays itself out against a backdrop of war and cultural oppression in this compelling tale of conflicting loyalties and forbidden passion. As Aida soprano Micaela Carosi's "voice wasn't only luminous; she was alive in the role...every fear frustration and outburst of love registered in her voice face body" (San Jose Mercury News). Tenor Marcello Giordani plays Radames "mustering a ringing sound and suitably ardent phrasing" in the opera's climax (San Francisco Chronicle). "Mezzo-soprano Dolora Zajick delivered a powerhouse performance as Amneris cloaking her unstoppable dramatic fury in plush and impeccably controlled tones." -San Francisco Chronicle "As Amonasro baritone Marco Vratogna emitted gorgeous orchestra-defying sounds." -San Francisco Classical Voice "Glamour came from Zandra Rhodes's fantastically colorful production. Gold for days patterns upon patterns (based upon authentic Egyptian designs) and costumes that more than a few singers undoubtedly wished they could take home forever." -San Francisco Classical Voice
