Since 1969 when Chuck Close first exhibited his series of black-and-white portrait heads his paintings have fascinated the public. Working mostly from instant photographs Close paints in a style that vacillates between representation and abstraction. His colossal heads at first severe and confrontational explode with painterly energy mesmerizing the viewer with their mosaic-like surfaces. Chuck Close: A Portrait in Progress traces the artist's evolution and follows Close into New York's contemporary art community.
