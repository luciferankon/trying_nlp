On a space station in the not-too-distant future two guests arrive early for a wedding and the older tells the younger a story about the groom's father who had been a well-known entertainer and his selfish wife. The story which starts in Seoul in 2002 is a bizarre love triangle of a comedian who never smiles a Taekwondo instructor and a whining woman who wants to be a TV star but who'll do anything to avoid being poor. Before the story ends with the wedding there are jail sentences a fatherless baby who needs a bone marrow transplant a blind and forgiving masseuse an abused melon and lovers caught in flagrante delicto.
