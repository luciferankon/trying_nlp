In the mid 1990's Jane and Jackie Sicole went on an unprecedented killing spree sparked by the rape and murder of their sister Janice. Young men from across the country (some inanely misogynistic and others completely innocent) were slaughtered-strangled stabbed and even dismembered by the blood-lust of these two mentally deranged siblings. Now in 2016 the killing spree continues-only it isn't the Sicole Sisters responsible for the current murders but rather their psychopathic followers-a full-fledged cult that has assembled to honor the sisters and their vicious vendetta. With the new murder-spree still in its infancy the millennials across this nation have yet to quake in terror at the mention of the name "Sicole" but as the cult's death toll rises it won't be long before every young man eyes every young woman he meets with suspicion - before every young man won't be able to approach (or be approached by) a young female stranger without a jolt of ice-cold fear racing through his heart.
