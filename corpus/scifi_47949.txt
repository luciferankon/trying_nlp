A huge spaceship makes its way to our world and sends out a smaller ship with three aliens in it to have a look around. Something goes wrong and the three explorers eject to Earth in small pods as their vessel explodes. Only one being seems to survive and as is usually the case the local authorities just want to shoot at it and call the military. The alien goes into hiding thanks to the help of a blind music teacher who has psychic powers and a sympathetic priest with good intentions. It turns out that the visitor just wants to make nice be friends with everybody and would simply prefer to go home rather than hurt anyone. His friends are looking for him but time is running out!
