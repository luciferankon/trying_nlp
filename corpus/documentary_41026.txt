ARE YOU MY MOTHER? is a two-part series on inter-country adoption. In it two young Australians originally adopted from overseas set off on a quest to meet their birth mothers. Not everything is as expected and painful secrets are revealed. Who is the real mother of these children? What fears are held by the loving adoptive parents? Why did the birth mothers relinquish their children and where do the children now belong? These are stories of love and loss guilt and pain but ultimately they are redemptive journeys for everyone involved.
