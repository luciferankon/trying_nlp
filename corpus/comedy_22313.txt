In the off-beat style of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE this southern tale narrated by executive producer Jeff Foxworthy follows the comical missteps of a lovable loser Bill "Crackerjack" Bailey IV (CJ). His residence of choice is a single-wide. His entrepreneurial endeavors include collecting state quarters and Dinky Dolls. And the only diamond that he gets near is not on the finger of his live-in girlfriend Sherry but instead a softball diamond which is CJ's drug of choice. However when Sherry learns she's pregnant and moves out to prod CJ into action the real root of CJ's artful dodging comes into play: a curse in which Bailey men become absent as soon as a baby becomes present. Faced with losing his true love or confronting the curse and his impending fatherhood CJ does what any man would do- play ball!
