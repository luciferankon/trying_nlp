This 1996 video was the first documentary about the struggle for legal marriage in the U.S. While a growing number now support the right to legal marriage at that time too few understood the magnitude of what was at stake. The radical right-wing forces understood. Same-sex marriage -- and domestic partner recognition of any sort -- was lambasted and continues to be targeted in their TV and radio programs anti-gay videos as well as in all of their political endeavors. The video contains interviews with: Rev. Mel White well known from his "60 Minutes" appearance and his book "Stranger at the Gate: To be gay and Christian in America;" Phyllis Burke author of "Family Values: A lesbian mother's fight for her son;" Richard Mohr author of "A More Perfect Union;" Kevin Cathcart executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense & Education Fund. The video also highlighted some of the same-sex couples who have sued for legal marriage with personal recollections from: Faygele ben Miriam who along with Paul Barwick sued Washington state in 1971; Benjamin Cable-McCarthy who along with partner Marcial Cable-McCarthy sued California in 1993.
