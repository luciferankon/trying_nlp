Zehra and Ayse are two women whom are mother and daughter and sisters at the same time. They live with Mister Ziya in a garbage house which is old and pretty messy. Mister Ziya is their both father and husband. One day Ayse tells her mother that she is pregnant and therefore she wants to leave the house. Zehra does not want her daughter to live outside on her own. She has no strength to be alone. She tries to convince her daughter. She tells her that Mister Ziya has one foot in the grave. Ayse does not believe her. Zehra has no choice but disclose the secret in response: she tells her that she changed Mister Ziya's medicine therefore Mister Ziya will go to afterlife soon of 'natural' causes. Ayse believes in her mother. She is convinced to stay in the house for a little longer. We can never know whether Zehra tells her the truth or not.
