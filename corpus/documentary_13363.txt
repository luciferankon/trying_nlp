October 2013: for one month Paris became the world capital of street art. Neither a museum nor a gallery it's an apartment building bound for destruction that became home to the biggest collective exhibition ever imagined. 4500 m2 of street art with more than 400 artworks spread over 10 floors. Over the course of six months Mehdi Ben Cheikh founder of the Galerie Itinerrance invited more than 100 artists from around the world: from Brasil to USA through Tunisia Italy or England. All of the artists came to take over every square meter of the "Tour Paris 13" secretly and without means. All together they were determined to exhibit their art to the widest audience. Over the course of 30 days the tower was made accessible for free to the public becoming instantly a street art manifesto. People and medias from across the world rushed to the "Tour Paris 13". But despite hours of queuing up major media publications and 570 000 visitors online nothing will prevent the tower from its final - and artistic - destruction. Paris Tower 13 is an immersion in the process of art creation an exclusive and final testimony of this adventure narrated by the artists who made it happen showing that when radicalism and artistic integrity are put at the service of an authentic and generous project a popular success arises.
