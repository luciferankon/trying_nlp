In the late 1950s Hyacinth is working as a maid to Dulcie and Claude Cooper-Smith trying to pass off Daddy's alcoholism as the effects of his war wound - not that it fools her sisters long-suffering lock-keeper Daisy promiscuous Rose and Violet who knows how to play a rich man. When Dulcie learns of her husband's infidelity and takes a lover herself Hyacinth walks in on her but displays total discretion stating that she wants a gentleman as a spouse. Boyfriend William could fit the bill but Daddy predictably scuppers the relationship. Comedy prequel to Keeping Up Appearances set in the 1950s and charting the early life of the remarkable Hyacinth. Long before she became Mrs Bucket (pronounced Bouquet) young Hyacinth was already dreaming of matching china and a bedroom in pastel shades. But her desperate attempts to transform her sisters and her darling Daddy into an altogether better class of family are not appreciated. Daisy goes around wearing Daddy's overalls Rose has a new boyfriend every week and if Violet continues consorting with her married manager she could be inches away from shame and destitution. The girls live together in a crowded canal cottage with their father a part-time brush salesman with a drink problem. If only the family were more like the Cooper-Smiths in whose house Hyacinth works as a maid. Because now she has had a glimpse of how the elegant upper classes live there can be no looking back.
