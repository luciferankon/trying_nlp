Forerunner to the long running comedy "The Goodies" this was a sketch-based show with a surreal edge. Two series were made in colour for BBC2 (the only British network to run colour transmissions before October 1969). Some ideas came from a long running radio series 'I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again' which featured the same cast plus John Cleese of 'Monty Python' fame and David Hatch (now an important man in the BBC's admin hierarchy!).
