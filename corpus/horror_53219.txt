Fleeing religious persecution in France Carmilla is traveling down the Mississippi River with one of the early French expeditions of the "new continent". She entertains her fellow voyageurs and followers with ancient stories of pagan goddesses and warrior women. When a priest overhears Carmilla's stories he condemns her as a heretic and has her buried alive. Over three centuries later Carmilla rises from her grave in Northern Iowa and seeks revenge on a small rural community. Inspired by Carmilla by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.
