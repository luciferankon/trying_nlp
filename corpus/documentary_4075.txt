Saint-Josse-ten-Noode is the smallest borough in Brussels the capital of Europe. It is also the poorest. A socialist Mayor has been ruling there for almost 50 years defending the right to difference and staying attentive to the community. The film draws a subtly shaded picture of a political entity as one might find anywhere in the world forming a portrait of an out of the ordinary Mayor in the daily practice of his duties.
