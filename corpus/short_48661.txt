Set to Scott Allen Nollen's epic Scottish suite "The Forty-Five" which tells the tale of the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion led by Charles Edward "Bonnie Prince Charlie" Stuart (the last time the Scots ever fought the English--and lost AGAIN). this 13-minute video features stunning photographs of Nollen during his 1990 research trip to Scotland while writing his critically acclaimed book "ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON: LIFE LITERATURE AND THE SILVER SCREEN" published by McFarland in 1994. There even is a guest appearance by Fairport Convention and former Jethro Tull bassist DAVID "Peggy" PEGG who went on to a longtime friendship with Nollen and wrote the afterword for Nollen's 2001 book "JETHRO TULL: A HISTORY OF THE BAND 1968-2001." The band's massive influence on Nollen may be heard clearly in "The Forty-Five."
