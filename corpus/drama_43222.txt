At 10.27am on December 28 1989 a major earthquake hit the Australian city of Newcastle. It was centred on the Newcastle Workers' Club in the heart of Newcastle. 12 people died in the earthquake... 9 of whom were in the club. This is the true story of those who survived. It's based on a play of the same name which in turn was based almost verbatim on interviews conducted with the survivors themselves.
