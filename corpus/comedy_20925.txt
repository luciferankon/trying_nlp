When do you know that you've hit the big time? Struggling comedian Derek has started a writing job at a top-rated nightly comedy show and his career appears to be secure but he's unfulfilled. He isn't making the type of comedy that he loves. After a serendipitous late-night interaction with an unassuming fan Derek finds an outlet for his comedy by doing stand-up bits in the subway. These bits are filmed by his subway audience and posted on Youtube Facebook distributed through Snapchat. In the subway he is free to say what he wants and what he thinks people need to hear. He doesn't hold back on politics race or gender and for his commentary he faces verbal and sometimes physical abuse. Neither stop him from always being authentic funny and thought provoking. Derek puts his job and personal relationships on the line to be the artist he must be. Derek is Funny is a feature film about the struggling artist who won't sell out even when the most sought-after television deal is his for the taking.
