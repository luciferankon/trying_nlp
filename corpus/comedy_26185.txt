Armand Goldman owns a popular drag nightclub in South Miami Beach. His long-time lover Albert stars there as Starina. "Their" son Val (actually Armand's by his one heterosexual fling twenty years before) comes home to announce his engagement to Barbara Keeley daughter of Kevin Keeley US Senator and co-founder of the Committee for Moral Order. The Senator and family descend upon South Beach to meet Val his father and "mother." What ensues is comic chaos. Lies and deception -- it's all in the family when a man must convince his future in-laws that he's as uptight as they are. Armand and Albert have built the perfect life for themselves tending to their gaudy Miami nightclub. But their pastel tranquility is shaken when Armand's son announces that he's getting married to the daughter of ultra-conservative Senator Keeley . . . and they're all getting together for dinner! Can Armand and Albert transfer transform themselves into Mr. -- and Mrs. -- Family Values in time? It'll take the performance of their lives but they'll do anything -- and everything -- to pull the chiffon over Keeley's eyes! The Birdcage - a drag club on the South Beach. Albert Starina the star of the show - one half of a couple with Armand. Val is Armand's son from a long-ago heterosexual experiment and has been raised in the Armand and Albert apartment. His intended is Barbara daughter of the very right wing U.S. senator John Keeley co-founder of the Coalition for Moral Order. She is bringing her family to visit Val and meet his family (her parents think that Armand is a Greek diplomat). Results - mixup pretense and farce.
