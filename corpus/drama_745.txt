City dweller Roland Hale takes a job at a lumber camp in the mountains trying to forget the woman he loved who left him for another man. The camp is located on Thundergod Mountain and is managed by a woman Enid Bryant. What neither Enid nor Roland know is that the camp's superintendent doesn't want Enid to get her logs down the river in time for reasons of his own and will stop at nothing to prevent it--even murder.
