Makis and Kokovios are friends and partners but mostly goof-offs. They are called to join the royal navy and they are already involved with two sisters Mitsi and Roi whose father Odysseas Bourlotos wants them to marry sailors. During the training of the two friends the two girls try to contact them through letters they hide in the pockets of the uniform of their master-at-arms who is none other than their own father. One day Mitsi decides to hide inside her beloved's laundry bag and sneaks into the naval yard to meet him. Her presence there gets the two friends in trouble and when Bourlotos sends the bag to a tank landing ship they do anything in their power to set the girl free.
