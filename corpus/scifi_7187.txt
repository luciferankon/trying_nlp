Night Passage is a digital film on friendship and death. Made in homage to Miyazawa Kenji's classic novel Milky Way Railroad the story evolves around the spiritual journey of a young woman in the company of her best friend and a little boy into a world of rich in-between realities. Their venture into and out of the land of "awakened dreams" occurs during a long ride on a night train. The filmmaker elegantly depicts each encounter in two-dimensional space with a unique artistic gesture and ingeniously frames the passage as a series of rhythmic image sequences as seen through the window of a train.
