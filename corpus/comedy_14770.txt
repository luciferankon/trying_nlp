Always moving but never going anywhere employees at the B&D Moving Company bare witness to some wacky things at every job site. These 5 industrial athletes roll with the workplace punches lifting the agonies of the job with pranks and shenanigans at every available chance. This particularly bad day at the 4-wheeled office includes a fist fight with a raging maniac a fish fight just for the halibut and a move-off against heated rivals that could only end in agony for one side and glory for the other. In other words just another day on the job for these "Bad Movers".
