First episode of Mafrouza a 5-part film dedicated to the Mafrouza (a shantytown built inside the antique necropolis of Alexandria) Mafrouza - Oh Night! shows the first entering in the neighborhood. An archaeological visit leads us to meet a few people taking the time to be really close to them. Each encounter reveals a new novel. And we discover how people survive daily with an incredible strength for life and a crazy capacity for happiness that enables them to grin and bear the harshness of the materials conditions.This first discovery of the Mafrouza universe is an opportunity to undermine the clich√©s frequently stated upon this region of the world. But the discovery also leads us to question the way we ourselves live here in Europe (or elsewhere).
