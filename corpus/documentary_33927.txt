Almost 600 years ago a humble peasant stood alone against pope emperor and king. He could either deny the truth he believed with all his heart or he could die at the stake. Today Jan Hus is little known outside of his native Czech Republic but in his day he challenged corrupt church officials and inspired thousands to live for truth. In an age when Europe was divided between three popes when pestilence claimed one in three lives and church offices were available to the highest bidder Hus defied the earthly authorities to seek truth directly from the Word of God. Truth Prevails  a quote from Hus himself is an hour-long documentary from The Christian History Institute and award-winning filmmakers Jerry and Misha Griffith. Using location footage interviews with prominent historians and period artwork this film follow the struggles of Jan Hus and the efforts of modern scholars which ultimately led Pope John Paul II to apologize for the Church's actions.
