Contestants ride shotgun and answer trivia questions as a professional driver runs terror-inducing flat-out laps. The game is fun simple and easy to play along. Over a series of rounds the fastest contestant to answer the most questions of increasing difficulty wins. Every episode is jam packed with laugh-out-loud surprises whether you're a car nut or watching with your family. You don't have to be a genius to win. But you've gotta be cool under pressure. And by pressure we mean 1.5 Gs pressing down on your chest while rocketing around a hairpin turn. Do you have what it takes to make it to the Winner's Circle?
