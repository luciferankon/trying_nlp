The HaptX VR experience features realistic haptic feedback in virtual reality enabling you to reach out and touch virtual objects. In the experience you wear a HaptX Glove and interact with a miniature farm in VR. You can run your hand through virtual blades of wheat. You can feel the raindrops from virtual clouds. You can pet a virtual fox and feel all four of its legs as it dances on your hand. In the grand finale you defend your farm from space invaders by crushing UFOs and swatting them out of the air.
