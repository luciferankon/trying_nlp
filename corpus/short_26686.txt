Here are the funniest fellows that ever appeared on the vaudeville stage. Everyone has seen this great team do their clever act and their record is and probably always will be "Standing Room Only" wherever they perform. They fall from great heights and throw each other about regardlessly and one marvels at their acrobatic feats. Extraodinarily good.
