Having spent the last three days watching crappy B grade horror films to catch up on his website movie reviews Charles attempts to attend his first day of Summer School. All he wants to do is get his Physics class out of the way before starting senior year. Attending Summer School as well by court order no less are two of Charles' friends Dennis and Steve. Also his crush Lindsey appears to finally be noticing him. If his teacher Mrs. Wickham doesn't drive him insane what lurks in the school just might.
