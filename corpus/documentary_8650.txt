Fifteen years ago film-makers Alistair Scott and Douglas Campbell spent a year on the notorious Raploch Estate on the outskirts of Stirling charting the lives of the many and varied characters who lived there. They found a huge variety of human endeavour and aspiration from single mothers to aspiring footballers a legendary teacher and those fighting heroin addiction. Earlier in 2017 Alistair and Douglas were commissioned by BBC Scotland to produce a new documentary that would uncover what had happened to the original characters from all those years ago. Many were reluctant to participate again but those who did take part gave a fascinating insight into changes that have taken place over the years. Ashley who we first met as a nine-year-old at Raploch Primary School has gained a place at Stirling University where she is studying for an honours degree in history and politics. We follow her out campaigning on a wet election day and unwinding with boyfriend Frank at ten-pin bowling. Steven McGowan was struggling with drug addiction and bringing up two young children as a single father when we first met him. Now 15 years later he is in full recovery and a leading light of the local addiction recovery support group. After a difficult period of estrangement we see him reunited with his children now on the verge of adulthood. Archie Wilson is still passionate about his gun dogs but has now directed his energies to passing on his love of the countryside to the youngsters in the Ochil Explorers. The pigeon men are still at their lofts seeking that winning formula that will bring them glory in the pigeon races and life continues in the Raploch.
