Based on the 1993 horror film "Demon Dolls" by Director Todd Jason Cook this REMAKE gives the cult classic a darker atmosphere and new slasher style approach. Looking for a gift for his little sister Mike comes across a clown doll at a small corner store. He purchases the doll and goes back home to begin setting up for his Halloween party with his friends. At Mike's party the body count begins and it soon becomes clear that the doll has plans for Mike's party guests and fun is NOT on the menu.
