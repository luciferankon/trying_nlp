The spirit of Dick Johnson lives on after his death and at his wake he returns to share the horrifying nature of the spirit world he's been visiting. According to Dick this world is a grim eternal and inescapable astral plane where the consequence of human misdeeds is an endlessly replaying loop of one's most terrible memories of life on Planet Earth. For Johnson these memories often involve his sadistic Uncle Willy who has merged with Johnson in the fourth dimension like threads in a loom.
