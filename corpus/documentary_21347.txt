Ziska is born and raised in Sweden. Never the less she is often asked where she comes from since she does not look Swedish. In 'Me & My Nose' Ziska is off on a journey to find out if she is Swedish how to get a Swedish nose and what a Swedish nose really looks like. She ends her journey in Copenhagen where she lives with her family. She has found that she will never become Swedish or Danish in a way where she will be one of 'us Danes' - or one of 'us Swedes'. She needs to be Swedish and Danish in her own way.
