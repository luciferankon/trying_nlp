Harry Preston is a young philosopher from Leicester who arrives in the London district of Soho sometime in the late Fifties. He befriends James Compton-Street a Soho lifer who knows what it takes to survive in one of the most challenging areas of London. Through James Harry meets a myriad of strange unusual characters who he studies for a book he is writing. Harry also meets a group of film-makers who are putting together a documentary recording the end of an era. In barely a few months Soho will change with such force that few of the group will be left standing. Through the eyes of Harry and the camera lens of the film-makers the film takes a look at the people and the lifestyles that shaped the Fifties' Soho ghetto and gave the new generation the place and the ideas on how to change the world. Everyone knows now about the Sixties revolution but it was in Soho in 1959 that the seeds of the Sixties were sown. Where it all began.
