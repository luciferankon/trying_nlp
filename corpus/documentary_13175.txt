Two young nuns explore Chicago--from a supermart to the Art Institute and in front of churches on Sunday--confronting people with the crucial question "Are you happy?" They meet many people--a lonely girl a happy mother a nun some lovers two hippie musicians a lady sociologist a college professor even Stepin Fetchit; and receive many answers--"Happiness is the absence of fear" "Avoiding people" "Rasberries" "Joy in knowing Christ." The humor and sadness of these honest encounters lift the film beyond its interview format to a serious and moving inquiry into the concerns of contemporary man and also into the circumstances in which men will actually express their concerns.
