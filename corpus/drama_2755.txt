This movie chronicles the trials of the mentally ill and their care-givers in an over-crowded ward of a hospital. Dr. MacLeod (Robert Stack) is a new optimistic doctor who attempts to start an out-patient program for the women in the ward. His method of treating mentally ill patients without violence or punishment is met with resistance by the head nurse Lucretia Terry (Joan Crawford). During Dr. MacLeod's treatment the phobias and illnesses of the various women in the test group are explored.
