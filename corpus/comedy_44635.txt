Edward Lear's Nonsense Stories is a series of 18 original animated webisodes based on limericks from Edward Lear's A Book of Nonsense (1846). Each limerick is recited by a caricature of a celebrity or politician followed by a black and white whiteboard and Flash cartoon animation expanding on Lear's limericks and adding more cartoon action and improvised mockery while a silhouetted audience makes rude comments.
