A filmed stage-play recounting the story of Jesus as set in modern day Georgia with music and reverent humor added. Essentially a one man show with a cast of four musicians fleshing out many of the Biblical characters. The music and lyrics were completed by folk singer Harry Chapin shortly before his death in 1981.
