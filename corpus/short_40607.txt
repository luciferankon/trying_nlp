A chilling thriller in the shadow of a nuclear power industry and cynical research around human life and death. There power and money means everything and life nothing. Somebody must stand up and make it plain. Somebody must gather the decisive proof - before it's too late! While in Berlin in the summer of 1993 my Fuji-P2 camera suddenly seemed completely strange to me. I reacted by filming myself while standing in front of a 3-piece "Hilton mirror" and panning the P2 back and forth so that my gaze followed the camera angle and so that it did not. (Dietmar Brehm)
