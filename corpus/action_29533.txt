Doodle Hex is set in The College of Runes a secret inter-dimensional college of magic that draws students from all over the cosmos to study the greater arts of Rune Lore. Trained by the Masters of the Runes each initiate hones their skills: from blasts of elemental magic to powerful curses that transform and transmute their victims and blessings that give the caster mighty powers. As in all schools lessons are quite boring with strict controls over the use of the most interesting runes such as the 'Thorn Bomb' or 'Howls of Pain'. So the students meet to challenge each other it in secret in the Doodlers' Club fighting to see whose magic is the most powerful!
