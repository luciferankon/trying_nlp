A snapshot of the porn industry in the San Fernando Valley focusing on a handful of people: Luke Ford a reporter who breaks the industry's gentlemen's agreement and writes about actors who have HIV/AIDS; Kimberley Jade a veteran actress who contracts AIDS; Katie June who arrives in Los Angeles from the South going on 20 with dreams of becoming a porn star and with her mother's approval; Jim South who runs a talent agency; and William Margold an aging factotum. Others appear on camera to round out a portrait of a busy industry that's lucrative for some and dangerous for others.
