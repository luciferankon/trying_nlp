A short film about how a family may look functional from the outside but is very dysfunctional under their own roof. Everyone in a family has their own issues some families are lucky enough to have an open environment where the family members speak their mind. However other families have something that I have tried to explore in this script. Each member with their own problems and they all seem to not get along. Hence Severed.
