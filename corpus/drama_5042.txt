Memories of Argentina in the early 1950s bring a man back (in his mind) to his neighborhood his family and their hardware store. Although the barrio was filled with people both for and against Juan Perón who was in office as President at this time the bonds of friendship were stronger than political differences. This view and the view held throughout the film is that of the man as a young child. Newsreel clips and scenes of Evita Perón's funeral insert an adult perspective though there is still an element of indecision throughout the film as to which perspective should hold.
