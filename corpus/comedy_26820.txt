Stipan is a policeman who comes to small Adriatic island off the Croatian coast in order to investigate reported strange phenomena that had frightened the whole population. At first nobody wants to co-operate with him but he finally finds that the island is being allegedly haunted by the ghost of Josip Broz Tito Communist leader of former Yugoslavia. For Luka the mayor this is the opportunity to turn entire island into Tito-themed amusement park. Tito's WW2 veterans on the other hand don't believe in ghosts; for them the apparition is actually Tito himself who had returned in order to lead them into a new revolution which would restore Communism. There is a rumor that the ghost of the deceased marshal Tito appeared in a small island town. Old partisans believe that their time may have come again so they set up a pilgrim's shrine for the veterans of WW II at the place of the ghost's alleged appearance. The mayor wants to use this event to promote tourism in his town. A police officer Stipan must find what really is happening there.
