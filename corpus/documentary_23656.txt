November 9th 2009 marks the twentieth year since the Berlin Wall fell. This film takes a new look at the reunification of East and West Germany. During the forty years Germany was divided two very different societies evolved. A socialist dictatorship was established in East Germany while West Germany developed a democratic capitalist state with help from the Marshall Plan. Within the context of contemporary issues like globalization consumerism and the monopoly of power held by the industrialized countries of the world this film explores the problems that arose when trying to form a united Germany in 1990 and the rise of East German nostalgia as a response to rapid privatization and the "free" market.
