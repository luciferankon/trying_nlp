Valentina (16) is crazy about dancing going out and lively music. Who listens to folklore nowadays except for your grandmother maybe? No way for Valentina it's chalga! Hristian (21) doesn't understand one bit of her choice. How can you enjoy music which lyrics like that? And what's more: it's not even Bulgarian! Pop rock rap folk chalga or dance: there's no accounting for tastes right? Well not if you ask Bulgarian adolescents. How does your choice of music reflect your identity? Valentina en Hristian both have strong opinions. About themselves each other and... about Bulgaria.
