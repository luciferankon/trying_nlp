Adelaide is a woman who hurts herself to get attention - not cutting herself but calling an ambulance for assistance with very specific instructions before then overdosing on drunks or sending herself into anaphylactic shock things like that. Her best friend is Doctor Taylor. When she decides she needs to have a friend her own age she meets a man behind the chemist's counter and it seems like a natural fit.
