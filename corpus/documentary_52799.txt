Classic BBC comedic documentary from 1987 comparing and contrasting a group of novice British skiers at SÃ¶ll with a group of more experienced British skiers in Wengen. The commentary is minimalist allowing the participants and the situations to speak for themselves. The film is all the more entertaining for that. For many Kevin is the star of the show.
