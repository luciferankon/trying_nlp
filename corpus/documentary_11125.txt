In 1971 Bruce Iglauer founded Alligator Records the most successful modern blues label. In early 1992 Iglauer staged the Alligator Records 20th Anniversary Tour starring Koko Taylor Elvin Bishop Katie Webster Lonnie Brooks (w/Ronnie Baker Brooks) and Lil' Ed and the Blues Imperials. Director Robert Mugge's film PRIDE AND JOY: THE STORY OF ALLIGATOR RECORDS documents that exciting tour.
