The Sound of Gunfire from the Plain of Jars is a fictional recount about the escape of Pathet Lao unit surrounded by Royal Lao Government forces in 1958 in the plain of Jars. This movie was the first fiction feature made since Lao People's Democratic Republic's foundation in 1975. Thought as propaganda the movie has been banned shortly after its release because of the representation of an alcoholic military officer and resisting ethnic tribes.
