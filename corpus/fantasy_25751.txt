When a young nobleman drowns while visiting their shore the superstitious villagers go to the local shaman asking him to perform a rite to marry a living woman to the dead man so he will not take revenge. The shaman refuses claiming that the ritual can only be held every 10 years. The villagers ignore his warnings and attempt to perform the ritual themselves but only succeed and calling disaster down upon their land.
