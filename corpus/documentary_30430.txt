Even if this affirmation may seem strange to us today neither the Mexican cowboys or charros nor mariachis and tequila had necessarily to become the signs that represented Mexico within and outside of its national borders. Why is the mariachi Mexican and not for example the rich tradition of fandango from Huasteca or Vera Cruz? Why tequila and not mezcal from Oaxaca or pulque from the highlands? Why the Creole cowboy and not the northern cow herder or the tzeltal from Chiapas or even the part-indigenous man from the Yucatan? Charro mariachi and tequila: local products catapulted to the position of national representatives. They are no doubt richer in their origin than their mediated branding has afforded them. In this program we will witness the motives behind why history and the country's turbulent circumstances decided at one time that Jalisco was Mexico.
