A documentary exploring the fur industry and trade in Ireland. Currently there are three fur farms in the Republic housing roughly between 100000-150000 mink and there are at least dozens of shops selling real fur across the country. In 2010 the Irish gov't pledged to ban fur farming but after the collapse of a Fianna FÃ¡il-led coalition in 2011 Fine Gael scrapped the proposal and it's back to square one. However active efforts demanding both a ban on fur farming and to convince shops to remove the sale of fur continue.
