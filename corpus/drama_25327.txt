Sam and Mary Friedman are an unhappily married couple with an allotment of issues. This is primarily due to the dysfunctional nature of their relationship. Neither person wants to confront any of these problems. Sam is a religious man while Mary keeps her secularism secret from Sam. To make matters worse Sam invites his old college roommate Noah to live with them without permission from Mary. Noah brings his problems into their house and eventually into their marriage. His personal issues start causing more conflict to arise within their already crumbling marriage.
