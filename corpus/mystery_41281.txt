This movie documents a group of local ghost hunter/movie makers' interaction with the spirit of a lady who was allegedly killed in the Little Theater in an unsolved murder mystery from the early 80's. After connecting with her through use of digital photography which reveals her location as a glowing orb they learn she is trying to get the group to discover the whereabouts of her body when they receive a postcard in the mail from her one day. However in their search the group becomes involved with the individuals responsible for her death. Much as in American Folklore the group discovers a group of local citizens have made deals with the devil to secure a blissful life on earth in exchange for spreading corruption on earth and selling their souls. Elsey Stroud was a comical playwright and thus the movie features an appropriate comical overtone at times to honor her work. Throughout the production though the group was unfortunately not able to acquire enough solid evidence to take to authorities. The map that they follow leads them into a trap that fortunately they escape. However they realize that just as in Hamlet "The play is the thing to catch the attention of the King". The fruit of their labor is manifested in the movie Ever in the Shadow which is the actual movie the group of ghost hunters and Stone Creations LLC made in order to reveal the forgotten about injustice in the Chester community. This movie premiered October 29th in the actual theater where the lady was murdered. It is believed that both the orb of Elsey Stroud and her murderers were in attendance. The evidence presented in the movie was not enough to lead to arrests but at least enough to share Stroud's story and hopefully enough to make her murderers uncomfortable from committing further crime.
