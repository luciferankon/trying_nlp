Well the plot goes like this: It was her first time playing any online game. Her name is Finefaily. The kingdom is Basia. She never put much thought into any games. They were not her thing. She did not want attention or fame. She spent $10 on the game which was a lot on a stupid game she thought and got into the 7th biggest alliance on the second day. Texaslineman was the alliance leader. He fell hard for Finefaily. He kept wanting to meet her in real. She kept resisting. After the biggest alliance started falling apart and Finefaily recruited most the heavy hitters for Texaslineman their alliance won the wonder and Tex became king. Finefaily was still the same person. Vulgar and funny enjoying the moment when Texaslineman kicked her from the alliance putting her in a sister alliance with a man called sterling cal. He was alliance leader there. Tex informed Finefaily that her antics were not appropriate and forgot about their friendship and bond for the love of prude alliance members. Well Fine tried so hard to fit in at the new alliance. She even made friends with the meanest smartest individuals The Russians to keep her new alliance safe. One girl in this alliance kept making it hard on Finefaily. Rude comments. Starting feuds. Finefaily finally had enough and gathered some of the alliances strongest players and made a game plan. For no one booting the ignorant jealous girl we would burn the whole alliance to the ground. We set up our game plan and at 3 am one morning burned sterling cals alliance to a crisp. Texaslineman even laughed. I had told him no one needed to watch over me. And I proved it.
