Seventy-five year old Ruben Pardo is the oldest elevator manual operator in Los Angeles. For six days a week over the past 40 years he has helped the patrons of the Art Deco marvel at 5514 Wilshire Blvd "up and down" while enlightening them with positive musings on the simple joys of life. Congrats on 40 years Ruben!
