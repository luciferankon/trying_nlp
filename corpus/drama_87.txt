Blood On The Wall$ is a whodunit and a character study with the look of a Cassavetes-like independent film. It is the story of Cooper Michaels a once super-successful television producer who smokes up his career in a crack-fueled downward spiral. Leaving Hollywood and returning to his adopted hometown of Baltimore the former investigative journalist stumbles upon the story of Swiss Williams a young painter on the rise in the art world. The day before his highly anticipated New York gallery debut Swiss Williams -who has dubbed himself the "Jay-Z" of painters- kills the influential and mysterious art dealer/gallery owner Kwame Pierre Addo and then turns the gun on himself. As Cooper Michaels investigates his feature story for Baltimore Magazine-which he also hopes to option as a screenplay for his Hollywood comeback-Cooper not only begins to piece together the curious life of Swiss Williams but he is also forced to come to terms with his own fractured portrait as both a writer and a father.
