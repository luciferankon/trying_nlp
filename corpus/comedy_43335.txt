It's Somethin' Suave' Theater. That little semi-glorious waste of 2 hours of your time. Hosted by Tim Caldwell the show brings you an eclectic mix of cartoons classic commercials animated shorts music videos and even a movie. It's Halloween and Tim plays the classic Night of the Living Dead. And he also passes out candy to the neighborhood kids. So sit back max and relax grab a mental margarita and enjoy.
