Kurt and Brian are the Windy City's coolest salesmen and best friends with a shared dream: NFL ownership. When they're not making huge deals they find themselves disrupting NBA playoff games flipping their company cars throwing wild toga parties and investing in defunct gold mines with their group rowdy friends. The two have everything they want in life: great jobs great friends and for Kurt an accomplished beautiful fianc√© who views him with love and humor. The only thing that would make life better would be quitting their jobs and realizing their dream of buying a professional football team. Everything changes when good fortune smiles on Kurt and Brian. Following an offhand suggestion from Kurt's girlfriend they play their lucky numbers and win the biggest lottery in history...half of it anyway. The windfall allows them to quit their jobs. It also puts them one step closer to realizing their once-impossible dream of becoming owners in the greatest league in the world. But they can only buy a professional football team if they can persuade the other lottery ticket holder to combine his fortune with theirs. The catch? He happens to be their hated ex-boss.
