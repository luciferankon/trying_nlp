In Gansu north of China two families talk about their ways of living in the farm: since nomadism until today's commerce animal husbandry and industry. Narrated by the filmmaker's own voice this short film provides a personal point of view about not only the Yugur's idiosyncrasy but also about part of the Chinese history and takes by leading character one of the most grassland's representative animal: the sheep.
