The Valley takes place in a landscape where millions of Brazilians transit every year: the Paraíba Valley a sea of hills where the industries and cities that link Rio and Săo Paulo are. The documentary shows how the earth settlement process transformed this region into a battlefield: there in a few decades coffee trees substituted a millenary forest. Through the voices of farmers workers and migrants who exchanged the countryside for the big city and the big city for the countryside "The Valley" tells the story of a devastated land and its heirs.
