James Benning took the founding of the New York Times in 1851 as a departure point for his latest film Deseret. In the best Benning tradition Deseret unfolds magnificent landscapes captured with a stationary camera during a dozen-odd trips throughout the calendar year - deserts plains of snow lonely trails trees in bloom cemeteries ruins unfriendly rocks empty settlers' houses roads that seem to be leading nowhere a few isolated human figures. Deseret's starkly composed images suggest a space haunted by the official history written back East in the Times. Benning collected 93 stories about Utah boiled them down to a few lines and used a different shot to 'illustrate' each sentence. As we reach 1900 his black and white footage spectacularly turns to color. The stories told recount the loss of American innocence: from the woes and persecution of the Mormons the fights with the Indians the struggle to become a state to the turning of Utah into a testing ground for nuclear power. And beyond the power of words Benning's camera keeps probing: do landscapes remember?
