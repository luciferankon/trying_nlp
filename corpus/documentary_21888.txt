When does life begin and what follows it? These questions touch on so many scientific religious and ethical problems. Is it a scientific question when we ask at what point an embryo becomes an independent being? Is it a religious question if we ask from what point an embryo possesses a soul? Is it an ethical question to ask if abortion can be considered murder? And the ultimate question: what comes after life?
