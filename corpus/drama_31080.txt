Michael Kagan is a drifter. Haunted by his past and his dead brother (who serves as his conscience) Michael pushes on through vast landscapes insearch of "The Cowboy". The Cowboy is a legendary drug leader from Mexico who is said to be running an underground operation that could promise money. But Michael soon realizes that his past is far too broken to be fixed by money. The Black Shoe Drifter is a dark look into the life of a hopeless drug addict.
