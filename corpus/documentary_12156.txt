Obuse the smallest town in Nagano. The town planning of Obuse started about 30 years ago with the idea of creating a comfortable space where the townspeople can enjoy themselves and building a town to be proud of. As a result the deserted town in Northern Nagano transformed into a tourist destination attracting a million visitors a year in a town with a population of ten thousand. This film is a documentary focusing on the fascinating and charming locals living in Obuse including key players in the town planning. The way they live may be an inspiration for town planning in Japan and around the world.
