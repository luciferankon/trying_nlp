Baggage is a dating game show with a difference. In order to advance in the game you must show your potential match every embarrassing piece of Baggage about yourself. In the first round three women enter with three suitcases each; small medium and large. They can alternatively be three men with a woman as the main contestant. The main contestant brings with them a huge red bag containing a shocking piece of Baggage that is revealed at the end of the night. The three women open their smallest piece of Baggage which is normally an annoying habit something they did as a child or another comical secret. The main contestant gives their views on each of the cases and then is presented with three medium ones. These contain more embarrassing secrets and each belongs to one of the three women but it not revealed who until the main contestant decides which case they will eliminate from the game. The women then claim their baggage and the one who owns the eliminated case exits the game. The remaining two face off by opening their biggest suitcases which hold their deepest and darkest secret and the main contestant must choose which secret he finds less shocking. The owner of the worse case is forced to leave. The winning woman is given three choices of what is inside the red bag and professes which they would react to the most. The big red bag belonging to the main contestant is opened and the chosen woman must choose whether she can live with the secret. If she cannot the main contestant is told "that they have too much baggage" and must leave.
