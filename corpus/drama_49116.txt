The Yaqui Journey video offers a visual insight into an important part of Yaqui Indian history that until now was mainly passed by word of mouth by individual family members and recounted by some non-Yaqui historians and anthropologists. Yaqui Journey brings to life the early days of twentieth century Arizona directly from the unique perspective of the Yaqui people. With the help of the Yaqui historians and consultants the Director/Producer/Writer worked on making the story entertaining as well as informative like a history lesson from the Yaqui point of view with an all Yaqui cast and in the Yaqui language.
