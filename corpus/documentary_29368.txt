Valery Liashkevich is a homeless artist who lives at a railway station and for over twenty years has painted pictures in the streets of the town of Gomel in Belarus. For the natives he is no more than a local attraction but the filmmakers set out to show that this eccentric artist and philosopher has many important truths to tell us about the meaning of life that his work and attitude to the world make deep sense. Two large exhibitions of his works one of them at the National Art Museum in Minsk were a huge success and garnered the interest of art critics. The documentary was made with private money to support this extremely talented artist.
