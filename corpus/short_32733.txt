A man (Joe Marzano) turns to the camera and asks "Am I insane?" He then tells a story about a young woman who loved her horse. Consumed with jealousy he reveals his plan to kill the horse and once again asks "Am I insane?" Marzano's film was re-edited by his friend Louis Stuart into much shorter version (13 seconds) in which nothing is seen except the two "Am I insane?" questions.
