Spring is in the air. Simple-minded and spirited Marika travels from her Hungarian hamlet to Vienna where she gets a job at her aunt's bakery selling salzbröthchen to the Emperor. She meets a very nice soldier who is composing a march yet she is expecting the wealthy man a fortune-teller did promise. Anyway to help him she puts the march in the Emperor's brötchen. The military Spring parade (Frühjahrsparade) is approaching.
