The Night Man is a psychological portrait of Max (Michael Eisner) while he experiences a mysterious existential breakdown. His primary symptom is that he sleepwalks at night with no memory of where he goes. His girlfriend June (Kathryn Lyn) has her theories as does his friend Nick (Hayden Gold). Hypnotism a s√©ance faith and medications all fail to help until Max - (on the edge of sanity and armed with a video camera) - decides to confront his own subconscious face to face. If you've enjoyed offbeat and surreal stories about identity crises as in The Twilight Zone or the films of Roman Polanski and David Cronenberg you'll be intrigued by the philosophical questions raised in The Night Man.
