BE PREPARED TO STOP is a documentary about our love of and absolute dependence on the great American highway. We rely on those roads and the countless big rigs rolling down them to supply us with just about everything we use every day. But this round-the-clock lifeline has become so entrenched in our daily routines we don't even notice it any more. Now that neglect is reaching a crisis point. Roads and bridges are failing; safety concerns are mounting; skilled drivers are retiring; government is at a standstill. In order to raise awareness about the impact the impending breakdown will have on all our lives BE PREPARED TO STOP aims to not only explain the issues but also to energize stakeholders to push for solutions that will improve the current situation and build towards a secure future.
