Launched in 1992 as a companion for "Beverly Hills 90210" "Melrose Place" quickly became a giant television hit in its own right. Originally designed to be an authentic grounded look at 20-something life in Los Angeles the program soon became "90210"'s soapier yet equally popular counterpart. The 'Unauthorized Melrose Place Story' highlights the remarkable behind-the-scenes moments that shaped the series including cast drama Heather Locklear arriving to "save" the show and the actors begging their writers for even wilder story lines to make them fan favorites.
