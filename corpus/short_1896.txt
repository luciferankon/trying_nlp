During an experimental séance conducted in a dank Winnipeg warehouse in the summer of 2010 the disembodied spirit Eck is prematurely conjured back to life and allowed to run amok on earth once more. But without Will Rogers around to supervise the resurrection the séance is botched. Eck is lost yet again doomed to wander the haunted forest of film history but he isn't alone. From James Cruze's 1922 lost film 'One Glorious Day'.
