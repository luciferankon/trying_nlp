With numbers of immigrants rising in the UK and laws changing around the possibility of work this documentary series explores the lives of [poor] Romanians trying to make a new life in Britain. Part 1: Alex sleeps in a car park next to Victoria station and helps new arrivals settle in London. Roma Gypsy Sandu struggles to settle in Liverpool with a limited grasp of English. (Channel 4) - The British series was heavily criticized as biased by critics and Romanian citizens alike because through its exclusive selection of desperate protagonists and hellish filming locations it grossly misrepresents the largely successful Romanian immigrant population and their evolving home country. The 3-part-series was filmed produced and directed by James Bluemel.
