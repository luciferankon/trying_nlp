In this stark yet nuanced drama 21-year-old Lucy (Caylie Rae Kalmbach in a gripping debut) spends an increasingly overwhelming week struggling to gain her footing after learning she is pregnant. Having grown up with an absentee father Lucy is determined not to make any child suffer through the same and sets about evaluating a number of young men she knows for their fatherly potential. Making matters worse Lucy is reluctant to approach what otherwise should be her main source of support her mother and sister for fear that their religious conservatism will render them more judgmental than helpful.
