Jarl and Baltazar are walking together home from school. Suddenly their conversation changes to the subject "believing in god" and whether it matters or not. Jarl thinks it's ridiculous to believe in something non scientific while the christian Balthazar claims that believing in god is the only thing who can save humanity. Jaarl tries to convince Baltazar the opposite and the two boys ends in a dramatic climax where all they can do is to believe.
