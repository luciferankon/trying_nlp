When Djaner 7 sat down next to his new classmates on his first day at a German primary school he could hardly believe it. Lena whose birthday it was was given a candle and a pen as a gift. The whole class sang to her. In Macedonia Djaner's former homeland school was all about being afraid of being beaten.

But which parts of this does she want to accept and what is she prepared to give up for it?
