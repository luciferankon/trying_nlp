On August 6 1945 the atomic bomb exploded over Hiroshima. Little known is the fact that among the estimated 140000 casualties of that day were 12 American prisoners of war held at the Hiroshima Military Police Headquarters since July 28 when they had been shot down during a bombing raid. For decades many of the families of these 12 Americans were never informed as to the fates of their loved ones. Thanks to the tireless efforts of Mr. Shigeaki Mori himself a hibakusha (A-bomb survivor) the names of these 12 are now included in the Hiroshima Peace Museum and the relatives have learned the truth. Paper Lanterns documents the story of Mr. Mori and his dream of reaching out to the relatives of these lost airmen.
