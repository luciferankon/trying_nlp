Francine "Gidget" Lawrence is now married to her idol Jeff "Moondoggie" Griffin and they live in Santa Monica California. Moondoggie works as an architect and Gidget runs her own travel agency with her long-time best friend Larue Wilson. Gidget and Moondoggie also take care of Gidget's niece Dani who lives with the couple while her parents are overseas. Dani is very much like Gidget in many ways when she was a teen and was always getting into trouble. Gidget's father Russ provides advice to the young couple and reminds Gidget that Dani's exploits were similar to the ones she experienced (and sometimes caused) as a teen.
