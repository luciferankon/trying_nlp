80 voglia di te (I want you so much) is the story of a psychologist in a marital crisis who except for his work and phobias of various patients is dedicated to his family two sons (struggling with first loves and school problems) and his father grandpa Frederick. One day a new patient comes in to his office. Little does he know that this new patient is actually his wife's lover.
