7 is a concert film of the Norwegian band supersilent. Recorded in Oslo in August of 2004 it is the first video release by the band after four records (1-3 4 5 6) all released on Norway's Rune Grammofon label. This is completely improvised music sometimes very noisy sometimes very quiet and ethereal and always very beautiful.
