The comedy team that brought you "The School" and "Saturday School" team up again in this up-roaring offensive Skit Show that reminded America why Tyler Jacobs and Ian MacKenzie are best friends. Enjoy fun skits like "Joe Johnson; The Master of Calm" or watch Tyler build a laptop in 6 seconds or if you get really bored watch the exciting adventures of "Paralyzed man".
