Krabi Krabong: The Buddhai Sawan Path is the first groundbreaking documentary to accurately document the ancient system of Thai weaponry. The art of Krabi Krabong as it was taught at the original Buddhai Sawan was a highly refined fighting system whose effectiveness was linked to an individual warrior's agility strength and speed of attack. A thorough knowledge of body mechanics enabled those skilled in its use to engage in combat with a wide variety of weapons delivering devastating blows with an elegant simplicity of movement. Shot on location over a period of 5 years is a rare document of slowly vanishing art.
