What do you get when you mix two handfuls of barely legal ska rockers with 4000 miles of van lockdown gas station burgers and mattress substitutes? This is Tour--the real life documentary of King Django and The Radiation Kings a roots ska ensemble ready for their big break. Tour chronicles the trials of this family of friends as they travel from New York City to the southern tip of Florida and back. Loneliness and life ambitions take a beating and all that they take from the road must come home with them.
