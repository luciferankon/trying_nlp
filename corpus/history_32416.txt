Ertugrul launched in 1863 was a sailing frigate of the Ottoman Navy. While returning from a goodwill voyage from Japan in 1890 she encountered a typhoon off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture subsequently drifted into a reef and sank. The maritime accident resulted in the loss of 533 sailors including Admiral Ali Osman Pasha. Only sixty-nine sailors and officers survived and returned home later aboard two Japanese corvettes. The event is still commemorated as a foundation stone of Japanese-Turkish friendship. Wikipedia.
