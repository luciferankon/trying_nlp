Las Vegas promoters planning a review starring Jahna Steele invited transgender women to participate in "The World's Most Beautiful Transsexual Pageant" a two-day contest from which eight or so women would be offered jobs in the review. About 20 women arrive for all-night rehearsals and the pageant itself: swimsuit evening gown and talent competition the selection of eight finalists and three prize winners. We follow the women backstage and get in-depth profiles of six: two from Chicago and one each from LA San Francisco San Antonio and Columbia South Carolina. We meet their families and we learn about their lives and their journeys of self-discovery and acceptance.
