Emily is a damaged young woman who endured a childhood of violent sexual abuse from her father. She sets out to find the man who 'made her the woman she is today' and make him pay. She gets a ride from Carl a slightly annoying and very nosy cab driver. Throughout the long drive the two share cigarettes and stories and find out they have more in common than they thought.
