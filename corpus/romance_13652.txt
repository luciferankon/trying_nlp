Stranger in my heart is about a happy and calm life of Delara but recalling some scenes of having affairs with unknown guy takes away her from her current life but nobody believes her. Delara has nothing to do except secretly searching her past that she could remember everything. One incident. key of this memory loss - mysterious - one family that.... may know where is delara's past lost?
