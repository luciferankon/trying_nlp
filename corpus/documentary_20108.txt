Two German students (Dir: Thomas Repp DoP: Rudolf Barmettler) are traveling from Chicago to LA following the ruins along old Route 66 through seven states: Illinois Missouri Kansas Oklahoma Texas New Mexico California. The film is showing the Architecture of the abandoned road and the people and places along the bypassed road. It's an old American myth connected historically to the second generation of pioneers in America who built a road across the country. Dustbowl FSA John Ford and Steinbeck are lurking around the corner in the design of the static b&w Pictures which are "moving stock photos" in the spirit of the Lumi√©re Brothers. The film its without any commentary and without music but with Original Documentary Sound. For all those who want a piece of live in the 90's on Route 66 - for those who want a piece of cake: Sir Alfred Hitchcock's films are good for that... (e.g.Psycho)
