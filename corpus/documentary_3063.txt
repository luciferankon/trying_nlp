Filmed entirely from first person point of view the Journeymen documentary follows three young South African photographers from different walks of life as they travel 24 000km throughout the country in a motorhome to capture South Africa's promising contentious and confusing present-day democracy. From urban sprawls to dusty rural roads the trio were driven by the question "Has Mandela's vision of equality in a rainbow nation been achieved?" Wikus de Wet Sipho Mpongo and Sean Metelerkamp from contrasting cultural and racial backgrounds find themselves learning about the country they call home and even more about themselves as young South Africans.
