Jesse James retired and living under an assumed name in St. Joseph Missouri agrees over the protests of his wife Zee to join Bob Ford and Sam Wells in a Colorado gold raid. Jesse rounds up gunman Arch Clements; demolition expert Elias Hobbs with suspect credentials as he later blows himself up; and get-away wagon driver Johnny Jorette. They rendezvous at Ford's saloon in Creede Colorado where Ford's girlfriend Kate joins the gang. Sam guesses Ford's plan to double-cross Jesse and collect a reward and Ford kills him. Lots of other people die before Jesse and Ford ride off in opposite directions. This was made shortly after Tom Neal in real life nearly killed Franchot Tone in a fight over Miss Payton so when she sings (unless she was dubbed) "That's the Man for Me" in this film it appears to be heartfelt.
