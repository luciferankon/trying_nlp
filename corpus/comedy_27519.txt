High school senior Bobby Chrystal fails his French class which will block him from entering Yale. His rich authoritarian father hires an attractive 29-year-old to tutor Bobby over the summer and help him pass a make-up exam. While Bobby's friends lead him away into strange excursions aimed at losing their virginities Bobby finds all the extracurricular activities he needs with his new tutor. Bobby has had trouble with French at school and so his rich parents hire a winsome 30-year-old tutor to help him with the first subject. The father is not exactly subtle about his interest in the tutor but the woman prefers his much more sensitive son.
