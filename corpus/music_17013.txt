Every summer on a tiny island off the coast of Maine an eclectic mix of banjo pickers fiddlers accordion players bagpipers and folk singers gather to play for each other the local islanders and the visiting schooner ships. This quirky "Sweet Chariot" music festival with its traditional sea shanties crumbling concert hall dockside lobster bakes and multi-generational jams offers a taste of the bygone days and a rare glimpse into classic Americana.
