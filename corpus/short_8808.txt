One Voice is an unscripted round table discussion that invites the viewer to join a conversation about the American voting system in the 21st century. A sampling of citizens from the continental U.S. discuss: after several elections have notably had issues (Florida we're especially looking at you!) should we vote and if one does vote what is the civic duty of the American voter prior to casting a ballot?
