The Ohio Country 1755. General Edward Braddock's British army has been annihilated six miles from Fort Duquesne by a French-Native American guerrilla force. The "French & Indian War" has begun. Now the British colonies of Pennsylvania Virginia and Maryland are undefended and French-led raiding parties use terror to roll English settlements back toward the Atlantic coast. In this dark time Virginia turns to its most experienced young leader George Washington. For three years Washington matches wits with "the most skillful of enemies." Finally the British government launches new campaigns against the French in America and George Washington will face his greatest challenges of all.
