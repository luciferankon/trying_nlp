The Story of Spencer and Nancy is about a 25-year-old man name Spencer who through the eyes of himself as an 11-year-old remembers his first love Nancy Sheridan. Spencer is a dreamer and dreams of his life with Nancy about fifteen years from then. However in the fantasy Spencer remains 11 while Nancy has aged gracefully into a beautiful 25-year-old woman. He works as a Very Important Guy fighting corporate crime. Nancy is a psychiatrist just like his mother (after all Spencer at the ripe age of 11 knew few gals so he was not aware of many career options available to the modern woman). After work he smokes a bubble pipe shares canned pasta products with his perfect wife and occasionally feeds their cat Jack. Everything is smooth as honey until Nancy tells him she is moving. Way to break young Spencer's heart Nancy Sheridan.
