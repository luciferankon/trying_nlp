The TV antennas are removed from the roof of the building. Since no one can watch TV the inhabitants begin to talk together. They decide to start up a antenna club to get a new antenna for all of them. But this turns out to be much more complicated than could have been anticipated. The stairway is full of noises. It's prime time and the residents keep to themselves and their TV-sets. When the landlord decides to renovate the property and removes all their little aerials silence falls except for the old lady in the top flat who has an indoor aerial. Everybody assembles here to see the repeat of a popular soap and suddenly they realise what they have been missing all along: fellowship and shared goals. They get together to fight for their cable club. Now they will be really good neighbours.
