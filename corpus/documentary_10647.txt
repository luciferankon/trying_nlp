In 2007 Academy Award winning actor Adrien Brody fell in love with a partially burned stone barn reminiscent of an old European castle hidden in the woods of upstate New York. Looking to fulfill a life-long dream of having a place in the country he went out on a limb and purchased the enchanting but dilapidated structure. Adrien took charge of an elaborate restoration of the property spanning seven years transforming it into a magical place to share with family and friends. Teaming up with filmmaker Kevin Ford Adrien created a personal cinematic record of the journey. Stone Barn Castle is a portrayal of the pursuit of dreams and the distance one must travel to achieve them.
