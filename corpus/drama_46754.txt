The film narrates three stories which take place in the poor periphery of Salta Argentina. Aside from a similar social situation the different protagonists share the same view of life beyond any experience of success or progress. Every protagonist is going to experience a personal development to an at first sight invisible positive change. As well the necessity of living according to one's own personal values is playing a big role. One of the episodes for instance deals with a very poor family who is winning a brand-new car at a competition. However the pleasure about it is not lasting very long as the question comes up on how to keep up the vehicle.
