A gang of thieves has pulled a huge jewel heist but has had to hide out in a tiny South African village posing as members of a fraternal order called The Oddballs. As they wait for their buyer to arrive and take the jewels off their hands they receive word that the Grand Wizard of the Oddballs is planning to make an inspection visit that threatens to blow their cover. Adding to the confusion the son of a bushman chieftain has arrived in town seeking a "wizard" who can restore water to his people and of course he assumes that the Oddballs dressed in the costumes of their order are the wizards he wants.
