How does artist Matthew Barney use 45000 pounds of petroleum jelly a factory whaling vessel and traditional Japanese rituals to create his latest art project? Barney plowed the waters off the coast of Nagasaki to film his massive endeavor Drawing Restraint 9. The documentary Matthew Barney: No Restraint journeys to Japan with Barney and his collaborator Bjork as the visual artist creates a "narrative sculpture" telling a fantastical love story of two characters that transform from land mammals into whales.
