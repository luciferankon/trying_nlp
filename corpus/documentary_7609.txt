Rock Lake Pyramids: This segment looks at what lies beneath the surface of Rock Lake. It is believed that old civilizations had built structures in this area of Lake Mills WI. Archie Eschborn and his group have been mapping and studying these underwater structures hoping this will be the next big archeological find. We will join them on one of their expeditions. We also visit a nearby pre-Columbian man-made structure in Aztalan.
