Two middle-aged men are having a picnic in an open field beside a tree. They barbeque two pieces of chicken while their pet parakeets hang in a cage from the tree. While cooking they seem to try to outdo each other with stories of potential calamities which could cut short their respective lives. The scenarios become more and more dark and ghasty to behold. Suddenly they realize that while fantasizing about horrible possibilities they have let their chicken burn. While trying to douse the flames of their barbeque it starts to rain very heavily. This despite the fact that it was a sunny day up until then. Rushing to get everything put away they scramble into their car only to have their trip cut suddenly short by an unexpected stroke of nature.
