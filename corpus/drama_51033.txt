The commander sends the young soldier Koleto on leave so he can bring the bagpipe. It turns out that moths eat the family bagpipe. Koleto looks around the village. The only man who owns a bagpipe is the priest. There is a party in the pub. Koleto plays a sad song. It brings back forgotten emotions and feelings. At the peak of the party the barber cannot hold himself and shoots with the shotgun at the bagpipe. The wound on the instrument that turns breath to music is fatal.
