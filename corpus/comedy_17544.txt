TOO MUCH INFORMATION hosted by Norm Sousa is a half-hour comedic panel show where two teams of comedians use their collective charm and humour to rise above their opponents in a battle of wits. The comedic panelists will change from episode to episode but the funny is constant. Equal parts silly witty titillating and crass similar to the popular UK shows Never Mind the Buzzcocks and 8 our of 10 Cats "TOO MUCH INFORMATION" promises funny stories sharp one liners odd and absurd asides and scathing swipes at the world. No topic is off the table and free comic reign is encouraged provided it is funny and engaging. Jokes personal anecdotes and taking the piss out of the world at large and sometimes one another is all fair play. Each episode is structured around a theme like sex religion or celebrity. Norm strategically guides the panelists through the four distinct rounds for an entertainingly smart chat show offering a perfect storm of stories tom-foolery and one liners.
