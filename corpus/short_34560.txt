Before he became the world's most famous reggae star Bob Marley was a farmer. Bob used to say that some day he wanted to stop playing music and go back to the farm. Now his son Rohan is fulfilling his father's dream by starting a coffee farm in the beautiful lush Blue Mountains of Jamaica. Rohan decided to focus on coffee because it effects so many small low-wage farmers worldwide. He and his family founded Marley Coffee based on the Rastafari principle of 'Ital' which brings together the concepts of fair-wage sustainable shade-grown and organic farming. In this way Rohan is helping to raise the bar of responsible ethical farming.
