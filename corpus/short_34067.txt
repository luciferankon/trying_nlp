Will your digital information last longer than yourself in the flesh? Digital Tattoo: Artefact 1 is a choreographic art film in which the human body becomes a canvas for digital data. Inspired by the 'Right to be Forgotten' law which was introduced in the UK in May 2014 the film addresses concerns surrounding online privacy and identity which are becoming increasingly prevalent in the news and our everyday lives.
