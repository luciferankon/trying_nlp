The inspiring characters of One Vote include the charismatic owner of the last tavern polling place in the US an Alaskan family that travels by dogsled to reach the polls an iconic American investor who devotes his Election Day to transporting voters in Omaha needing a ride a gospel-singing physician who heals and empowers disenfranchised citizens in rural South Carolina and a former felon casting an emotional vote in Kentucky for the first time since his right to vote was restored. Their vivid stories connect us with elections of generations past as well as voters' dreams for the future. At times funny surprising and heart-wrenching One Vote eschews partisan politics in favor of a human portrayal of voters' Election Day experiences. At a moment of unprecedented cynicism about the political process One Vote bears hopeful witness to the humanity and rich diversity of American voters and to the unsung stories that comprise our exercise of democracy.
