Hansjörg Stähli is the diligent Chief Refuse Detective of a picture-perfect town in Switzerland. His daily focus to maintain cleanliness and perfection is seldom interrupted except perhaps when visiting Lily Frei a charming local waitress with whom he is painfully in love. Unfortunately his attempts to woo her usually fail as Lily has a secret passion of her own: filling her tiny flat with tonnes of garbage. When Hansjörg solves his most difficult littering crime to date their shared endeavor of rubbish collection is awkwardly fused as the feisty perpetrator reveals to be none other than Emma Lilys troubled daughter.
