Love is a short film shot on super 8. No editing no post production. These are the rules from Straight 8. For 3.20 minutes we are in the aura of a Ballerina. We see her close up practising in the studio. We see her discipline dedication pain and love for her art. A film of intrigue and LOVE. A film which explores an art form that you as a performer do not choose to do it chooses you. A rare snapshot behind the scenes into a world which to the public totally is forward facing.
