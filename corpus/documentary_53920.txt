From the movie Jaws (1975) great white sharks have long been depicted as dangerous man-hunting monsters. In this expedition the environmental correspondent of Fusion and Univision Nicolas Ibarguen will work to dispel these myths and approach these animals from a different angle one much more rigorous but no less entertaining: the true role of great white sharks in today's oceans. Ibarguen joins world renown white shark expert Mauricio Hoyos conservationist Ocean Ramsey and the filmmaker Rob Stewart to do a set of submersions and explorations in Isla Guadalupe (Baja California Mexico) one of the world's top destinations to dive with the king of the ocean.
