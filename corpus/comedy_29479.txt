Serafín is a mature single and somewhat repressed antiquarian who suffers from a serious problem as a result of an infantile trauma: in his imagination he always sees all the beautiful women with a beard. In order to try to cure him a couple of friends take Serafín to Biarritz (France) although in fact their intention is to cross the Pyrenees to see the erotic films that are prohibited in Spain.
