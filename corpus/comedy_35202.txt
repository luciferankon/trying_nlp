Like many guys Mark Foster struggles with commitment but given his past he has good reason. Fifteen years ago his parents' scandalous divorce grabbed the public's attention and shattered Mark's ideas about marriage. Even worse Mark and his charismatic brother Hal were forced to pick sides and to this day disagree over whom to fault. Unfortunately Mark has never shared any of this with his unsuspecting girlfriend Erika who is about to meet Mark's embittered camera-happy mother Gretchen for the first time. As Mark desperately struggles to keep his family's sordid history under wraps during a long awkward weekend past issues resurface that force Mark to confront the thing he fears the most...his own lies.
