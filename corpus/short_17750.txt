A spectacular series of most gorgeous views of the setting sun. The pictures were taken at Menton in the southern part of France and present positively the most beautiful panorama of the sun sinking beyond mountain ranges and casting the first shadows of night over the sea ever reproduced. The series concludes with a grand view of a silvery sea illuminated by moonlight. Appropriate tints throughout.
