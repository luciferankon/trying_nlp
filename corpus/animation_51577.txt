On 9/11 Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist 'Art Spiegelman' (qv) (creator of "Maus") was in the immediate vicinity of Ground Zero fleeing the crumbling World Trade Center with his family. He wrote In the Shadow of No Towers to illustrate the first-hand horror of that day and the grief and disillusionment which followed. Inspired by Spiegelman's book guitarist/composer Marco Cappelli transforms it into a multi-media production. Actor 'John Turturro' (qv) a quintessential New Yorker narrates the English version (the original Italian version is also included with actor Enzo Salomone) accompanied by the music of Sintax Error fusing modern classical rock jazz country and cartoon music. The combination of all of these talents makes In the Shadow of No Towers a revelatory experience; its sorrow confusion and rage all familiar to those who have followed the turmoil of the last ten years but managing to surprise with its richness and variety of feeling.
