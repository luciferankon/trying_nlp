This is the unbelievable story of a Marine Officer: Lt. Col. Norman C. Bayley USMC (ret.). This is also the story of my grandfather. This documentary is the story of how the two became one. Around the age that you're told that your superheros aren't real you're also being told about world war 2 for the first time. My superheros were replaced by the one person in my life who actually did save the world... I asked my grandfather to sit with me every Sunday for three months and go through each chapter of the book he wrote (which I had never read). The book chronicles his experiences in the Pacific War of WWII. I had no idea what I was in for. From the priest that interrupted mass to tell the congregation about Pearl Harbor to the 6 months he spent on Guadalcanal where he landed with 250 and left with 11. From the attempted bombing of San Francisco (yes the one in California); to being asked to defend a marine for murder simply because he had a little pre-law in college. From being asked to go into Hiroshima one day after we bombed it with only a .45 and an interpreter to driving into Nagasaki and turning on the windshield wipers because it was raining...Nagasaki. My Grandfather it turns out is a Superhero.
