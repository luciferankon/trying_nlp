Sun Moon Bay is a documentary about the meeting of two different worlds. It is set in a coastal village in tropical China on the island of Hainan. For generations the villagers have fished the local seas and farmed their crops on the edge of the lush rainforest but modern China is rapidly encroaching as explosions sound in the hills behind to create landfill for the construction of an artificial luxury island and surveyors measure up the villagers' land for imminent conversion to resorts and golf courses. As the villagers face up to the prospect of lost homes and livelihoods the film follows the story of two village girls Huang Yingying and Li Na who enroll in a program at the nearby Sun Moon Bay to learn how to surf. The instigator of the surf program Da Shan sees the program as a way of teaching the village children how to integrate with the world that is changing around them and he is determined to push ahead with the training program despite great financial pressure. As the story progresses Huang and Li's stories diverge in ways that have subtle but profoundly moving things to say about the nature of existence of a lost rural idyll and of a modernity that can be challenging and liberating but also deeply dehumanising. We think of it as a beautiful but uncompromising film about hope and despair with the hope in the film being ultimately all the stronger for being hard-won.
