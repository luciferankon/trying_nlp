Fiorenzuola" without no problem of nationality because they have all Italian passport. The coach is Mario Kempes. The film follow the 52 days of the young players waiting to play in the Italian Championship. Among promises and hopes enthusiasm and extenuating waiting revealing a bizarre facet of the soccer "made in Italy" but also the romantic aspect that bring a group of boys overseas following the dream of their lives to play in the land of their ancestors. A document on soccer on certain aspects that in a stadium tribune is very difficult to observe. A document on return emigration on the circularity of the history on human beings that generations through generations carry on crossing the Atlantic in search of a better life.
