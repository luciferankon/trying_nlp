Dr. Rutledge and his team take an in depth look into a disease that has killed more people than any disease ever known -- Malaria.

They explore and expose the politics of domestic and international policies and find the evidence that the public never truly understood. What they find is astonishing. The greatest ecological genocide in the known history of man is laid bare -- the 1972 ban of an extraordinary life-protecting chemical DDT. This is politics -- the cold brutal crookedness that kills with a stroke of a pen. Shortsightedness of governmental and environmental policies is causing the deaths of millions and the suffering of billions.

For businessmen and women to endorse and encourage "alternatives" while a safe and proven PREVENTION sits idle is like fiddling while Rome burns. Africa loses nearly 3000 women and children on a daily basis not to mention 12 billion dollars annually to malaria alone. The team discovers that malaria is completely preventable -- completely. These young filmmakers trek from R. Carson's SILENT SPRING to the dead silence of millions of corpses and billions of suffering ones. And thirty plus years after the DDT ban the death toll is gargantuan. Is it a mere coincidence that deaths from West Nile virus mosquitoes and bedbugs are growing by leaps and bounds right here in the US?? This film is intended to go directly to you the American people with the certainty that it will dramatically open up a virtual blizzard of public debate. This is one film that is long overdue...
