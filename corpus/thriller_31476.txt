A throwback to seventies noir and blaxploitation. Black is an aged P.I. who still has a way with the ladies. His next case starts of simple and easy until it turns esoteric. Black is hired to find Bryce a rich closeted gay man being hunted by his wife so she may give his fortunes to a vampire in exchange for immortality. A dying sister sexy lesbians a computer geek a mysterious captain of industry an oddball cousin and a surly mailman all play a part in the story as Black looks to make good money and live to see the sun come up...and find a postage stamp. Nobody ever has stamps anymore.
