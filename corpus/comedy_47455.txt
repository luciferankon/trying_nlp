This stand-up comedy special is an invitation into a laugh-filled evening at The Crowd Theater in Chicago Illinois-and into the imagination of an exciting and inciting comedian Justin Golak. Throughout this hour the third one he has recorded Justin will present brazen views on a wide-range of topics. So relax your heart open your mind and loosen your perception of the egregious. And of course have a great time!
