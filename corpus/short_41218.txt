Two rag-pickers enter their hovel with their bags of scraps. After a little preliminary comedy they set up a white sheet. One of the rag-pickers now takes a handful of scraps from the bag and throws them in confusion on the sheet. They immediately begin to dance and hop about on the white background and when they stop they have made a complete likeness of the King of England. The scraps are taken off and another handful thrown on which in some manner resolve themselves into the likeness of the President of France. In this order then follow pictures of crowned heads of Europe and our own Theodore Roosevelt. As the parts of each limb come together various limbs noses and moustaches fly about in weird fashion before finally jumping into place. Now the rag-pickers do some lightning work in clay modeling all kinds of funny faces and weird expressions seeming to grow out of lumps of clay with no human aid. The manipulators then gather up their paraphernalia and depart.
