Part two of a two-part homage (and parody of) European horror movies from the 1970s-80s. This no-budget epic is the sequel to "Zombie Abomination: The Italian Zombie Movie - Part 1" and picks up the action right where part 1 leaves off. If you like chunk-blowing gore ridiculously sexist characters loads of laughs and more plots than a cemetery you'll enjoy this horror festival and convention favorite!
