RCMP Tim O'Hara (Tim McCoy) is sent to the Indian River territory to put an end to the terrorism which has resulted in the trappers practically giving away their furs by intimidation instead of selling them to the Hudson Bay Company. Before joining the force O'Hara was a resident of the territory and had left rather than risk a possible fatal brawl with Brad Harrison (Ward Bond) the brother of Tim's sweetheart Martha (Geneva Mitchell.) Upon his return Tim is openly and often taunted by Brad as having joined the Mounties so that he might return without fear of facing Brad's previous accusations of stealing a fur pelt. Tim's investigation leads him to wrongfully suspect Brad of being involved with the fur-stealing gang. When a prisoner in Tim's charge is killed Tim is jailed by his Mountie friend Bob Rutledge (Bob Allen.)
