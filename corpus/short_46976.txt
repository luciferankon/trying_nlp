72 Hours In Camden is a frantic free-flowing trip through the vibrant streets of London's most famous borough as it follows two aspiring rappers over the course of a long weekend. Blurring the boundaries of video-art and documentary it challenges our predisposed notions of artistic expression and the different forms it can take as our two protagonists encounter the many characters on the lively streets of Camden telling harsh life stories in their unique style of urban poetry.
