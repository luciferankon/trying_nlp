The movie 'We Fly Again' tells the unwritten story of the birds we cohabit with the crows. Although they live in very big groups near the metropolis and the increase the risks of spreading an entire list of epidemics among the human population since they feed from the cesspools and they rest in towns during the night fall the birds are harmless and they love people. The human tendency to protect life and nature in general comes in contradiction with the desire to destroy all those species we are not fond of. Looking beyond appearances why is the life of a crow or a fly less important than that of a nightingale or a squirrel? The ' We Fly Again' Documentary intends to present the life of these birds in an artistic poetic way proving that every part of nature has a beautiful side even if the known semiotics teaches us the negative part of these birds.
