Ian Bagg comic and life force. Who is he? Where is he? Where is he from? And why is he so funny? Questions. And the answers? In Ian's hometown. Terrace British Columbia Canada. I'm Taft Hartley. Stay with me as I fly into Terrace British Columbia and dig up the comic dirt on one of Canada's most beloved comedians. It will get messy and funny then messy again as history and egos clash to form a portrait of a man with a family friends enemies and the aspirations to leave his picturesque hometown and make it big in the business of comedy. Ian Bagg: Missing and presumed funny. Why? Because he's a comic. A great comic. Born and raised in Terrace British Columbia Canada. I'm Taft Hartley. Stay with me as I take a long walk around Terrace and speak to the people who lived loved and sometimes hated Mr. Ian Bagg.
