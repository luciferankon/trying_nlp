Danish journalist Mikkel Frey Damgaard examines his options of gaining satisfaction from a former rival who beat him to his love interest and slandered him among their journalism student peers. He seeks back in history and revisits the dramatic true story of notorious Danish duelists most prominently naval hero Tordenskiold who died in a duel over a stuffed dragon - and Lieutenant Georg Martin Halvor Von Schmidt whose fate was decided when he took the wrong seat in a theatre. A dispute with a peer officer followed and lead to a series of brush-of-death duels; a central part of life among officers and nobility in 18th- and 19th century Denmark. This movie suggests that perhaps this brutal but honorable ritual should be reinstated in some sense.
