A greater Vienna seniors home is run like a prison by the stuck up female executive and staff. Hipie type rebel Rochus 'Rocco' Siwak incurs a community service to be spent there as orderly. Sympathizing with seniors who still aspire some dignity and self-realization he helps them against the rules such as smuggling in contraband and ends up inspiring them to form a rock band and enter a free podium competition. Howevr it doesn't square with his own last shot as band guitarist.
