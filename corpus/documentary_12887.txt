In 1959 filmmaker Michael Colin's father went to Havana to make a movie about Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution. While there he met a Cuban dancer named Olga whom he married after being granted a divorce. In July of 1961 he showed up in Los Angeles at three in the morning and pounded on his ex-wife's door yelling that he had been imprisoned and tortured in Cuba while working on a frog farm for the CIA. The police came he was arrested and a psychiatrist diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic. He spent the remaining years of his life a broken human being. Michael Colin grew up barely knowing his father. In fact for most of his life this was all Colin knew about his father's erratic behavior: Something happened to him. In Cuba. On a CIA frog farm. Part historical mystery part Oliver Stone movie LOST IN THE SHADOWS documents Colin's quest to learn what really happened to his father. In 1999 Colin went to Cuba and equipped with nothing more than a single page from an old medical record of his father's managed to find Olga in Havana. This emotional and momentous trip combined with over six years of research through thousands of heavily "sanitized" government documents yielded a startling discovery: Colin's father may well have been telling the truth about what happened to him in Cuba.
