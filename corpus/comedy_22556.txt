This odd variety show displays scenes from Spanish and Catalan television (as well as international television) and mocks them by playing little "reaction clips". It also features some live action segments such as "Homo APM" where a man recites random quotes from the show to civilians in public places and "Ol√© tu" where comedian Peyu points out urban flaws in towns and villages all over Catalonia.
