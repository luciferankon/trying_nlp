The deputy mayor of Los Angeles and his fellow co-workers at city hall must stop the dim-witted under qualified womanizing mayor from embarrassing himself in front of the media and voters on a daily basis. This situation comedy centers around Ryan the mayor's right hand man who has to protect the foolish mayor Richard from those who have the ability to ruin his political career. Ryan and the city hall staff also have to protect the mayor from his own actions because he's constantly making an ass of himself. Making sure these incidents are not made public is a daily routine.
