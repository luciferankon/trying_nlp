At this driving school the only thing more dangerous than the learning curves are the instructors! When a candidate for state senate threatens the future of the D-rate driving academy 'Driven to Succeed' it's up to the self-centered owner (Jamaal Jordan) and his staff of moronic drunk pill-popping instructors (Chris Kamsch Kathy Carson & Rick Miller) to save the school... and their jobs! No strangers to child endangerment they recruit help from an unlikely student (Prince Tawro) to assist with some of the dirty work.
