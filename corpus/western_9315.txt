Crenshaw and Randolph are competing freight haulers and Randolph's lead man Tom Baxter has given him an advantage. A big hauling contract is coming up that requires a large deposit. Crenshaw has Randolph killed and the banker who is actually Crenshaw's boss then refuses to lend the money for the deposit to the new owner Randolph's daughter. Quirt Crenshaw knows his wildcat freighting outfit can take business from the P-BL freight lines by beating them to Eagle Pass. Tom Baxter who runs the P-BL for George Randolph and his daughter Claire and his helper Muleshoe sight Crenshaw's wagons and Tom wins the race to Eagle Pass. Town banker Adam Draper who is secretly backing the Crenshaw outfit is anxious to discredit the Randolph line since he knows the telegraph company is about to reward a lucrative hauling contract and Randolph is the only other competitor. Draper hires Roy Jessup and his gunslingers to hijack a P-BL shipment of gold bullion. Tom on a visit to see his girlfriend Elsie Draper's secretary learns of the latter's scheme.
