Partners follows the lives of two Rural North Carolina uniformed police Officers in a small southern town; Officer John Walker and Officer Mandy Kain. Both middle aged and veterans of the department; the story told in five separate segments will focus more on how the two officers handle both the job and their personal lives. The story will touch on the problems police officers face in today's society; however it will not be the typical police action drama portrayed in larger scale films or television series. The story is very character driven and deals more with the personal side of each character and the friends and co-workers which surround them.
