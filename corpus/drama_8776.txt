In Quebec 40s orphans or abandoned children are placed in a gigantic psychiatric hospital where children were locked. Were they sick? No they simply had no family. To escape this oppressive universe they created a parallel world: the institution's basement where in a maze of tunnels they founded an independent company with its rituals spells. A young girl Agnes reigns over this underground world that adults seem to tolerate.
