A young personable man named Jeetu meets a beautiful woman named Kalyani and feels attracted towards her. Eventually Kalyani falls in love with Jeetu and loses her virginity to him. After the death of her mother Kalyani feels insecure and she urges Jeetu to get married to each other. Jeetu does not see this idea of marriage as a suitable one. He says that he does not harbour the idea of spending the rest of his life with her. Kalyani is confounded now. She feels like she has been deceived so long. She tries to commit suicide but gets by a villager named Gokul who belongs to an inferior caste. Gokul weds Kalyani but he has the pervading feeling that he does not deserve her. Finally Jeetu finds out Kalyani and confesses that he wants her back in his life. He also tries to persuade her that she cannot spend the rest of her life with a man like Gokul who belongs to an indigent lower caste. Gokul overhears what Jeetu says to Kalyani and he tries to insist her to get back to Jeetu. An emotional Kalyani now verbalizes her love respect and gratitude towards him and her resolution to stay with him together for the rest of her life.
