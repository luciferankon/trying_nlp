The divers from the ATI Cave Exploration Team in Mexico led by Ivo Kalushev - a Buddhist teacher and full time cave explorer - take the viewer through the steps of true cave exploration. The film shows cave diving in it's most extreme form - sidemount and no-mount exploration of some of the most difficult and inaccessible submerged caves in the world.
