Three elderly ladies - Maiga Velta and Mrs.Tone - meet every Tuesday at a Culture House in a suburb of Riga to take part in rehearsals with 40-odd other ladies of the "Granny Choir". Some of them might be living more in the past than in the present but there is one extraordinary feature common to all. Despite their age low income and health issues they appear to know how to grow old with dignity a sense of humour and as it seems even joy.
