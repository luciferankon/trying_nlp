On April 2 1997 a U.S. Air Force A-10 attack jet commanded by Captain Craig Button mysteriously disappeared and crashed 90 minutes after takeoff from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tuscon Arizona. While flying in a three plane formation Capt. Button's plane armed with four 500-pound bombs deliberately broke formation and veered nearly 800 miles off course. Ultimately the plane along with Capt. Button's remains were recovered. But to this day the bombs have never been found. Was this a simple case of suicide or was Capt. Button out to steal the plane and its deadly munitions. Join us as we attempt to solve one of the most baffling missing aircraft cases since an entire Navy squadron disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle in the 1940's.
