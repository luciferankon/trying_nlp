In May 2016 two board members of the Applegate Trails Association in Applegate Oregon hiked 80 miles from downtown Ashland Oregon to the Cathedral Hills trail system south of Grants Pass Oregon in order to explore our proposed Applegate Ridge Trail. Our film documents this first-ever thru-hike adventure into the stunning beauty and diversity of "wild Applegate" which defines our region and who we are as a community.
