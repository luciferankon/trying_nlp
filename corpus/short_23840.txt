Goodbye Margaret is a return to Nicolette Swift's personal poetic style which makes up the majority of her early solo moving image work. The piece is a love letter to a dear friend that saw her through 20 years of her life combined with a visual essayistic exploration of the struggle to say goodbye to a single inanimate object that has over the years served as friend family and home.
