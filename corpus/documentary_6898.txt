Within our all-volunteer military approximately 15500 transgender people serve their country. These Americans are twice as likely to serve as their non-transgender peers and yet they have been forced to conceal their gender because military policies ban their service. TransMilitary chronicles the lives of four of those troops as they defend their country's freedom while ironically fighting for their own. They put their careers and their families' livelihoods on the line by coming out to top brass in the Pentagon as transgender in hopes of attaining the equal right to serve.
