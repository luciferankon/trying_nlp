DEVO was among the most thought-provoking bands to emerge in the aftermath of punk but before hits like "Whip It" DEVO worked in the basements and garages of Akron Ohio to make raw unfiltered music that the group called "Hardcore DEVO." In the summer of 2014 DEVO did 10 shows performing these seminal pre-fame songs created between 1974 and 1977 and rarely played since then. Shot at the Fox Theater in Oakland California this exciting concert film captures these groundbreaking artists performing the songs that started it all interwoven with interviews revealing the history of the band.
