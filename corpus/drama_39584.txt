One night. One house. One Island. Everything changes for a lonely man and three delinquent kids. Three teenagers on the run break into an empty holiday home on Auckland's stunning Waiheke Island. It's party time for the siblings until the owner unexpectedly arrives home is knocked unconscious and one of them is seriously injured. An unlikely bond forms as they attempt to get off the island. A wealthy isolated architect (Colin Moy) returns to his elegant home to find it has been taken over by three homeless teenagers. On the run their only objective is not to be torn apart by social services. Unwittingly they compel Jeremy to face the memory of his own lost son. But first he is forced to confront the explosive violence of 13-year-old Kenae (Calae Hignett-Morgan) and the sexual manipulations of his 17-year-old sister Tibs (Hanelle Harris). Over the course of the night the tables are turned and a tenuous bond begins to grow between them. When dawn comes so too does the law. Now the four of them find themselves on the run together.
