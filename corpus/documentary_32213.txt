May 18 1993 still haunts a lot of Danish police officers today. Among those who participated that day in the street fights at NÅ™rrebro Copenhagen two are dead and others have had sudden collapses. Even today some struggle with nervous breakdowns. Some of the officers feel the head of the Danish police have let them down.
