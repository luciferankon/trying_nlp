In the spring of 2012 hundreds of Vermonters submitted short films about Vermont's transition to a sustainable energy future through a statewide project organized by Bright Blue EcoMedia a Mooretown-based non-profit that produced the Emmy-award winning PBS series Bloom. The film features everyday people including teachers students and citizens as well as key political leaders and advocates such as Senator Bernie Sanders VT Representative Sarah Edwards and 350.org founder Bill McKibben.
