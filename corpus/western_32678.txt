Believing her father Dusty Jenkins ('Guy Kibbee' (qv)) to be a rich ranch owner Susan Nelson ('Jeff Donnell' (qv))) comes to visit him accompanied by her wealthy fianc√©e Jerome Winston ('Mark Roberts (I)' (qv)as Robert Scott) and his snooty society mother Mrs. Winston ('Isabel Randolph' (qv)) billed as her radio character Mrs. Uppington). Dusty instead of owning the ranch is actually just one of the hands. The real owner is absent so foreman Curt Durant ('Ken Curtis (I)' (qv)) and "Big Boy" Stover ('Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams' (qv))) and the other ranch hands ('The Hoosier Hotshots' (qv))) engage in a conspiracy to keep Susan and the Winstons from learning the truth.
