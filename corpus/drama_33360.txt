Kate Williams (Amy Lindsay) the new "Love Coach" in town can heal the deepest wounds. She is a couple's counselor helping couples spice things up in their relationships. Ann (Cassie Young) is a client who needs help standing up to her lover Drake (Danny Pape) and up for herself so she confides in Kate for some courage and advice. Kate has been good at helping most of her clients but can she help them all. Kate begins mixing work with pleasure and before long has herself tangled in a web of lies she can't get out of. As sessions with Ann are still underway acquaintances between Drake and Kate have spun this web a little stronger.
