This was an attempt to revive the old television series wherein a millionaire gives a million dollars to total strangers and how it affects their lives. In this case he first gives to a man who works in a garage with his two brothers and their boss is a slave driver. And a lawyer who is the son of a successful one but chooses not to have anything to do with his father and is a poor public defender and whose wife is the director of a youth center which is about to lose its funding. And a man whose missing partner might be guilty of embezzlement but since his is not around he's going to have to answer for it.
