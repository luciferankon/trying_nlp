Out in the wilderness death is a daily event. Nobody can do the hard work for the predators and their domains testify the eternal process of killing or be killed. Here you get to see the world's fastest and most blood thirsty animals such as the killer whale (Orcinus orca) risking to strand themselves in the hunt for an evening snack of seals. The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) catching a Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsoni) in a sprint with speeds over 100 km/h. The Great White (Carcharodon carcharias) using it's sensory abilities to feed off the depths and the grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) intercepting reindeer. In this documentary we get to see the flock animals the lone hunters and the lethal masters of camouflage caught on film. In dramatic intense and close sequences the eating habits of nature are captured and you only have two choices: to kill or be killed.
