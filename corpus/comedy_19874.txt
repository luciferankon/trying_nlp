Kimberly Beckmen is a reporter who cares less about being good than about getting a good story. She is drawn into the world of W.A.N.C at a tag team title match which pits Destroyer and Cannonball against Cowboy and Jeff "The Indian" Osbourne. With help from quack psychiatrist Dr. Melvin Gibson who allows his sessions to be taped Kimberly examines the wrestlers through her low-end news show Entertainment X. Intrusive interviews and hidden cameras reveal the underside of a league overseen by the scandalous Commissioner Connor O'Connor. Tag team manager Alan Burnskey works against Destroyer's Fianc√©e Janice Kreegman as she encourages the injured Destroyer to retire. Cowboy struggles with Jeff's growing mental illness while Pretty Boy Floyd and his partner struggle with Floyd's homosexuality and his partner's homophobia. Lobo wants life to return normal after the death of his parents. His little brother Ian wants to be a wrestler himself and looks up to Lobo and the friendly giant who calls himself The Mass. The league is brought together by the sudden death in the community. At the funeral Kimberly discovers an appreciation for the wrestlers and their lives as they exist beyond the ring. She and the members of WANC learn to accept loss change and a big piece of wedding cake.
