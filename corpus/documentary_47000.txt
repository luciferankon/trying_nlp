More than 40 years ago three civil rights workers were savagely slain in Neshoba County. That heinous crime was a watershed in the struggle for equality for African Americans. Return to Mississippi retells the story of the murders and the "Mississippi Burning" trial and examines the modern reality for African Americans in the southern United States. Andrew Goodman James Chaney and Mickey Schwerner disappeared while teaching and registering African American voters for the 1964 US federal election. On August 4th of that year their bodies were recovered from an earthen dam. In early 2005 in a landmark case that required the intervention of the US Supreme Court a jury returned guilty verdicts against seven conspirators. Has the struggle for rights started 40 years ago been successful? Rare archival footage echoes the voices in new interviews with personalities that figured prominently then and now.
