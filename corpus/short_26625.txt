Comedy about a clumsy female intern conducting her first survey about smoking and smokers. Both flattered and impressed she meets a few major artistic figures such as 'Serge Gainsbourg' (qv) or 'Bernard Lavilliers' (qv). But the film is also about the cigarettes which helped to make 'Humphrey Bogart' (qv) 'James Dean (I)' (qv) - and several others - immortal myths. And about the cigarettes and cigars of ordinary people which fill restaurants and other public places with their heavy smoke.
