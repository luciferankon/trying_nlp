Many people have a big dream. But Attila chooses a pretty weird way to make his dream come true. He lives in Hungary and his dream is an American dream. He wants to be a successful Hollywood actor but it's not easy task to him. He wants to get a job in LA to get visa and start to build his carrier. It's easy to think but it's really not so easy to do. Over time Attila thinks he won't reach his goal but he wouldn't think what is waiting for him.
