Some say Bigfoot is just a hoax but when a group of hikers go deep into the woods after being warned by a guide that has encountered a Sasquatch they decide to ignore him and go off trail but the deeper the go into the woods they realize that they are not alone. Becoming hysterical as night falls the group is terrorized to their core and accidentally shoots and wounds a Sasquatch. Legend says the Bigfoot species simply want to be left alone but when provoked they will protect their territory and in this case the damage has been done and there is no turning back.
