'By the Book' follows a Buffalo Police organized crime task force as it takes down a dangerous crime family led by Big Sal. After 18 months of building their case Sgt. PJ Rafferty (Andre Colon) is ready to lead his men (and women) into a raid to capture him. What they didn't expect was for Big Sal to come home late. Now they are stuck on a stakeout of epic boredness as they lay in wait. Rafferty is tasked with keeping his crimebusters Callahan (Will Mutka) and Grayden (Juston Graber) and his fierce femme fatales Ives (Angel Izard) and Hanna (Arlynn Knauff) alert on point... and sober.
