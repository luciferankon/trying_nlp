It is the year 1647 and the war has been raging for almost thirty years. Poor and dilapidated is the stronghold of the knight Václav Rynda of Loucka ('Rudolf Hrusínský (V)' (qv)) and so is his clothing. The family property was spent by his father who after the loss at the battle at the White Mountain was forced to give up his faith and had to swear submission to the Catholic Church to save his skin. Václav resembles a peasant rather than a nobleman as he tries to find something to eat for himself and his domestics. One day a visit comes to the stronghold. The emperor's commissioner Srandorf ('Karel Höger' (qv)) and his wife ask for a night's lodging. The guest then reveals to Rynda in private that Srandorf is not their real name and that in fact they are not even married - Jindrich Donovalský and his companion Katerina ('Blanka Bohdanová' (qv)) have come in the French king's employ and want to incite a revolt against the Hapsburgs in Bohemia.
