Born in Acadia of a francophone father and an anglophone mother Earl Tremblay is going through an uncharacteristically Canadian identity crisis. Resolved to resolve it he shoots the 19 rolls of film his filmmaker mother left him. His goal: to record his daily life and try to find the same meaning in French and in English. As the reels get shot over the course of a journey that pieces together the key moments in his life from his isolated youth in a small fishing village to his ascension to the rank of MP in the Conservative Party Tremblay watches his personality split and finally separate irrevocably.
