Worlds first "Royality Comedy Event". In an unprecedenced 9 hour live "piggyback" transmission comedian quartet 'Casper Christensen (I)' (qv) 'Frank Hvam' (qv) 'Lars Hjortsh≈ôj' (qv) and 'Lasse Rimmer' (qv) of _"Casper & Mandrilaftalen" (1999)_ (qv) fame marathon-hosted and satirically skewed every imaginable AND unimaginable aspect of the Royal Wedding between HRH's 'Kronprins Frederik' (qv) and 'Kronprinsesse Mary' (qv) on may 14th 2004. Characters included ex-boyfriends aboriginals so-called experts wine-tasters weathermen and a slew of hilarious off-beat characters all played by the four comedians. This event was the much anticipated follow-up to the successfull pre-test-transmission _Zulu Royal (2003) (TV)_ (qv) from the Royal Engagement October 8 2003.
