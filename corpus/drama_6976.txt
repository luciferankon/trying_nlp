Having lost his father at the tender of age of 1 Madhavrao grew up to be a shrewd political leader and champion of justice. However he was constantly faced with political intrigues and conspiracies of his father's brother Raghunathrao. At one point even his maternal uncle joined hands with the Maratha's arch-rival the Nizam. But when Madhavrao punished him for treason his own mother vowed that she would never look at Madhavrao's face again. At the young age of 27 Madhavrao died after a short illness yearning to see his mother's face. He is still remembered as one of the greatest Peshwas despite dying so young.
