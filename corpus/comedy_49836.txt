A British TV producer is traveling in Ireland when he comes across a village where they are planning a birthday party for the oldest man in the world. He decides he wants to make a film about this man but Patrick Farrell is not the delightful old man one would hope him to be. And he is not enthusiastic about making a big deal of his upcoming birthday either.
