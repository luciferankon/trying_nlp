A temporal anomaly causes factions throughout history to travel through time and space and battle for power. Play as these factions (Federation Klingon Romulan The Klingon/Cardassian Alliance etc) and use characters from the entire Star Trek universe to bring order to the galaxy or use the events to size ultimate power.
