War is explored as an ongoing cyclic production which opens with images of healing soldiers. Without pause for reflection the campaign immediately launches into the next phase propagation through recruiting new young men in 1960's era World War Two reenactments. One unseen soul seems to have escaped the celluloid! Upon witnessing the pattern she narrates resistance to repeating the cycle at first as a private psychological battle with propaganda and religious imperative. This half-freed unseen soul still caught in the bardos of the narration calls on other souls through many generations to break the cycle through reflection and reframing the meaning of war. Newly filmed dancers push against recontextualized old film characters in a collage battle to convert and save each other. In this cyclic timespace the linear narrative of war is lost so the stories of winning and losing become conditions rather than results undercutting the propaganda that war can be won definitively.
