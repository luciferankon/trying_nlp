In 1979 Jon Alpert a young journalist from New York who worked for NBC and had already accomplished several journalistic works in Cuba had the audacity to ask the Cuban government to accompany Fidel Castro on his plane to The United Nations. Fidel was going to give a speech as President of the Non-Aligned Countries and Jon got permission from Fidel himself to a rare and never before granted access to a communication outlet especially in the United States. Since the incident with Immigration of the Cuban delegation upon arrival in New York City until his return to Havana Fidel allowed Jon and his cameras to enter where he was staying at the Cuban Mission in New York including his bedroom. Frank Vales Fidel's then translator was also on this trip and attests to Jon and Fidel's rapport. You could say that besides being a never before seen documentary "A Trip with Fidel" has traits that resemble what many years later could be seen as a reality show where Jon captured a level of intimacy never seen before without losing sight of him for a minute. The documentary doesn't bring to light the Head of State that we all know but simply Fidel the person on the trip that at that moment many consider was at the peak of his political career.
