As a filmmaker with family roots in Detroit Michigan this film is inspired by the plight of many great cities in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution. It combines public domain footage with original photography to form a curious collection of pulsating fragments entering into conversation with the image of a human heart that may still be beating sealed in a jar. If home is where the heart is this film suggests that our post-industrial economy has left many of us behind longing for an American Dream that no longer exists.
