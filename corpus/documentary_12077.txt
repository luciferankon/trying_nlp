The Beauty Kills film explores how your perceptions of your own physical appearances affect your life. By doing so we challenge and blur the separate notions of "outer" and "inner" beauty among others. As we learn more about what "beauty" means to each individual we will discover how something as superficial as one's appearance can profoundly affect one's quality of life.
