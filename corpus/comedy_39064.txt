In this 'silent' sound-effect comedy Ronnie Barker stars as General Futtock who has a motley group of guests stay at his country estate for the weekend. Chaos ensues between the butler trying to catch glimpses of the good looking young guest rum accidentally falling into the punch bowl and the lost Japanese tourist.
