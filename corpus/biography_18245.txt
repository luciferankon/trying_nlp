Known as the "salad bowl of world" for it's production of lettuce broccoli and many other crops The Salinas Valley is home to thousands of Mexican American and immigrant families with strong ties to agriculture. About 30-miles into the valley is the small agricultural town of Greenfield where journalist Damian Trujillo's family first settled in 1972 after coming to the United States from Mexico through the Bracero Program. Growing up in Greenfield Damian worked in the fields starting when he was in seventh grade. Both his father and mother struggled to support their family of ten while laboring in the fields. Damian shared a room with his five brothers growing up in a small home in Greenfield. He dreamed of doing anything other than working in the fields like his parents and older siblings. Despite knowing little about higher education Damian was the first in his family to graduate from college. His older brothers and sisters sacrificed their education to work to make money for their family. This 30-minute documentary will follow the life of Damian Trujillo: from farmworker in the Salinas Valley to San Jose State University where Damian first realized he had an accent while working at the college radio station. Finally we follow his path to the NBC newsroom.
