Alice and Paul both study at the Sorbonne University in the Latin Quarter. After a course Paul who is attracted to Alice  starts talking with her. They share the same ideas about philosophy and today's philosophers but while they go on with their conversation they realize that as far as cinema is concerned they are not at all on the same wavelength: she is all for the New Wave whereas is definitely mainstream. With such conflicting viewpoints is it reasonable to think of romance all the more so to consider living together?
