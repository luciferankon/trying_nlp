When you look at Germany from above the country unfolds a special magic. Particularly in the winter time when Christmas lights make the cities sparkle und landscapes are decorated with white garments. On the island of Helgoland at country's northern outpost grey seals start the birthing season just before Christmas. More than hundred fluffy seal pups are born in the not so hospitably weather when snow is blowing over the sand dunes. On the opposite side of Germany in the Alps marmots have long rolled together to hibernate. Only a few ibexes still defy the icy weather and the multitude of strange visitors that populate the prepared sky slopes as soon as the first snow falls. But just beside the ski slopes white fairy tale-landscapes reveal their entire astonishing beauty when you look at them from above. Even cities do not remain untouched by the cold season. In Hamburg while the harbour must be constantly kept free from ice on the city lake Au√üenalster old and young people skate until their vats burn. The sea of lights of the Christmas markets spread all over the whole country look particularly peaceful and magical if looked from above. To the astonishing aerials elaborate time-lapse images and animations are added to answer allegedly simple questions like "what is snow exactly and how does it occur?" Tracks based on real GPS data are integrated into satellite images to show the routes of snow groomers or those of the migrating birds who spend their winter flying in Germany. Please do fly too and come with us on this 60 minute Christmas-special journey to experience how different Germany looks like when the cold has the country in its grip.
