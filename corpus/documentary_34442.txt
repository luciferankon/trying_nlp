Christian Orthodox nuns in a Romanian monastery call each other Ťlittle mothersť. They have renounced earthly trappings to wed the eternal. ŤGod my sovereign it is You I seek each and every morning. I hunger for You and my body and soul tremble for You...ť This is a film about the most beautiful among them and her marriage to God.
