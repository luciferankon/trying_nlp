When novelist Alessandro Battavia commits suicide a taxi driver named Evangile and her brother Nord believe they are characters imagined in a novel probably one written by God. Because they see their lives as "merde" they go in search of God to get their story rewritten. Along the way believing everything is imaginary anyway they shoot people rob pharmacies and tie up the residents of places they squat. They also gather a taxi full of eccentrics including a priest Battavia's suicidal widow and a policewoman; various couples pair off. Soon life imitates art: the events and ellipses seem lifted from modern fiction as the group's quest for God continues. What's real?
