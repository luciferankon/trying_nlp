This has to be the funniest and worst airline disaster movie ever. Most of the film is computer generated and the acting is no better than a school play. The 'aliens' (if you can call them that) take over the plane but the passengers don't seem to care as they are too busy gambling and having sex. Shame they didn't use the time to have acting lessons. If you want a disaster/horror movie that will make you laugh - this is the one. The budget must have been about $1000 and it shows !!! Don screams out as a horrific monster is about to eat him alive! But then he wakes up - it was only a dream! That day he boards his private 'plane a flying casino that caters to the needs of fantastically rich clients who want to play for high stakes at high altitudes. But the plane is engulfed in a strange thick fog that seeps into the cabin. The evil mist transforms the passengers and crew one by one into monstrous half human half insect creatures with a ravenous appetite for human flesh. Don realizes that it is his nightmare come true - it is his Flight to Hell!
