Chasing the Dog's Tail tells the story of Lava Jato through the eyes of four people who are both victim and cause of this extraordinary corruption scandal. Greed has many faces. Corruption transcends borders. This isn't just about Brazil it is about a world that still struggles with primal instincts of greed and the evolution of justice. These issues are ultimately a human problem. Which makes this film and the stories we are telling both compelling and universal.
