This early (1951) short which lasts less than two minutes features Sheree North--long before she became famous--dancing in a one-piece swimsuit and a pair of cat's ears. She then leaps out of camera range and reappears wearing a two-piece swimsuit this time with no cat's ears. She dances some more. That's it.
