Searching for a bit of creative inspiration in his humdrum file and order life an ordinary office worker types up an inspirational mantra . . . but in an average Times New Roman font. Meanwhile down below in the ebb and flow of corporate modernity anonymous pedestrians carry on their daily routines as a befallen office worker lies dead bleeding all over the sidewalk onto a mysterious piece of paper. As the two men begin an improbable and life-altering conversation truth and fiction blur into a twisted acceptance of fate. Taking a cue from magical realism and inspired from a short story by Michael Jones filmmaker Shreela Chakrabartty asks viewers to take a leap into the metaphorical realm of modern-day spirituality where meanings are sought and often misinterpreted.
