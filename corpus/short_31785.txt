US President Barack Obama made an unprecedented trip to Cuba on March 19th. Spending three days on the communist Island meeting with Cuban leader Raul Castro going to a baseball game and touring Havana. RYOT went to Havana to see what everyday Cubans thought of Obama's visit the unconventional Cuba and what makes Cuba so unique in people's imaginations. We left enchanted by Cuba's beauty and awed by its complexity; there's a lot more grey area to this place than we often give it credit for. One thing is clear: it's time to re-think Cuba.
