With the idea for a new project Adas surfs in the apparent anonymity of the internet. His goal: to break through this anonymity by meeting a person from one of the countless videochatrooms in which you can "next" a partner by a mouse-click in real life. After he actually convinces a nameless stranger to meet him Adam - armed with a camcorder - begins his journey from Warsaw to the meeting in Berlin not knowing yet how much further his little project will bring him.
