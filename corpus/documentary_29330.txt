The story of the emergence and fall of a small country Neutraal Moresnet in between Holland Belgium and Germany. It existed from the Congres of Vienna in 1816 to the Peace of Versailles in 1919 because none of the mentioned neighbours was ready to give up the first big zinc-mine of the world. Moresnet almost became the Esperanto-capital of the world.
