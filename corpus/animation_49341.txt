Everyone knows someone with a special laugh--and Gigglebug's is one of the greatest ever. It's his gift his innate ability and the key to transforming attitudes which ultimately shakes loose every gummed-up situation he runs across. The stories are set in the oh-so enchanted Greengown Forest where Gigglebug meets his young animal friends all dealing with growing up. Our curricular approach is to show how humour can get you un-stuck and a positive attitude helps you do anything better. The series is heartfelt warm and safe...and best of all a bunch of giggles.
