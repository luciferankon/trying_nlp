This new six-part digital docu-series explores a community-based attempt to fight violence in Burkina Faso in the Sahel region of West Africa. Each episode profiles a community member in the small town of SAABA: a police officer a Muslim cleric a leader of a vigilante security group a women's activist and the tribal chief. In the final episode all of the participants come together in an attempt to build security and resilience in a community on the border of Boko Haram and ISIS strongholds in West Africa. The series is an honest authentic people-centered view of a peace-building effort in an area drawing increasing international attention for its role in combating violent extremism.
