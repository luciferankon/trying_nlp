Master Tak is a sex-crazed womanizer who lives a lavish lifestyle based on his father's money. One day Tak's dad tells him that he is about to run out of money. He tells Tak that the only way out is for him to go to the Philippines and ask for a bailout from his ex-mistress Lilian whom he abandoned years before. She now lives in luxury with her son Joe Tak's half-brother. Along with his two sidekicks a Viagra-popping S & M fetishist (Fit Man) and his gay personal assistant (Lai Lo-Cheung) they arrive in the Philippines switch around their identities and move into Lillian's mansion where he falls for her "daughter" (who turns out in fact to be Joe). Complicating matters are a host of internationally mixed crazy servants.
