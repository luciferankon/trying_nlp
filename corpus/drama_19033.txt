The entire family of Bhau Kemkar lives on hope. They are so over-optimistic that they often disregard the hard reality of life. The family comprises of Bhau who is a bank manager his school-teacher wife an older son Vivek who works with an architect younger son Sandeep who works in a finance company college-going daughter Jui Vivek's wife Rama (the daughter in law) and their little son. They are an extremely loving family and each member has big dreams for the other. Rama however is an exception to this. A typical Puneite she is free-spoken and practical. Although she is good at heart it irritates her that her family members constantly build castles in the air. Her attempts to make them face reality fall in vain. One day the family is faced with a severe crisis. At such a critical time Rama sets her differences aside and stands like a rock behind the family. The entire family of Bhau Kemkar lives on hope.
