Two totally hot BFFs also happen to be LAPD's finest detectives as they solve "really gross murders like it's nobody's business." But they never let the grossness bring them down. They party hard and live life to the fullest. Besides solving crime they also give great fashion advice and never turn down a delicious cocktail (Even if they're on duty).
