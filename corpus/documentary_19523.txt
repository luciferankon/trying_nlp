FROM THE BRINK OF ETERNITY looks at what indigenous people of Kenya the Seychelles and Mauritius are doing to save their endangered species. In Kenya the film looks at how the growing elephant population is threatening the future of the Amboseli National Park. Once hunted to near extinction the elephants are now so numerous they have almost destroyed the park by uprooting thousands of acacia trees thus endangering every animal in the park. We speak with the Kenyan Wildlife Service about a plan to plant one million trees. In the Seychelles we see the world's most erotic plant the Coco De Mar. During the last three hundred years it's erotic and mysterious nuts were washed up on shores around the world. When explorers found their source the nuts were harvested and thousands of the trees where destroyed to keep the nut's value. We also see one of the word's rarest birds the Magpie Robin (just 30 birds left) as well as other endangered birds and animals. We speak with the Seychellous about their efforts to turn the tide of extinction. In Mauritius we see the world's rarest bird the Echo Parakeet (just 17 birds left) as well as the world's rarest tree there is only one left. We have all heard the expression " as dead as a Dodo". The Dodo comes from Mauritius and is the symbol of extinction. We see what the Mauritius people are doing to save their very special species. In particular we hear of one amazing success story. The Mauritius Kestrel was down to just 4 individual birds. Even the WWF had given up on it. But the Mauritius people saved this species. Today there are more than 250 in the wild.
