A minister who was raised in the Kentucky hills returns home from preaching in Vermont to try to end a generations-long feud between his family and another the McCoys. His family wants nothing to do with any kind of truce and throws him out. He moves into a small shack in the mountains and continues his preaching of non-violence and peaceful co-existence. However when he is forced to rescue his sister from the clutches of one of the McCoy men he finds his philosophy put to the test.
