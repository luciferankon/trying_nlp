Although Mansfield tells him that there are no reporter jobs available at the newspaper Barry is able to convince Mansfield to hire him in another capacity: as the fall guy. Whenever a disgruntled subject of a story or article comes into complain to Mansfield and to have the head of the person who wrote the story or article Mansfield trots out Barry as the author who using his charms is able not only to placate the disgruntled subject but have that person feel sorry enough for him not to have him fired. Mansfield comes up with a further back story for Barry to be married with a child so that the disgruntled person will feel even more sorry for Barry. Part of Barry's employment is not to tell anyone about the nature of his job.
