What on Earth? chronicles Suzanne Taylor's interactions with a lively community of visionary artists scientists philosophers geometers educators and farmers who have been profoundly touched by the crop circle phenomenon one of the greatest mysteries of our time and who gather every summer in southern England to engage with it. Filled with stunning circle imagery it presents evidence that the circles come from elsewhere and speculations about how accepting that -- which is hampered by our scientific materialistic worldview -- could help us think as a planet to solve the pressing problems that challenge us now.
