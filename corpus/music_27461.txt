A 47 minute TV special where he performs many hits in his inimitable charming manner with great accompaniment. The last ten minutes feature dated Mitch Miller style backing vocals but even this can't obscure the great musician/entertainer he was. A very high quality video is easily found on you tube. He is truly beautiful wearing a wonderful blue suit and a smile that might slay you. Recommended!
