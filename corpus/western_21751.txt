Jim Houston ('Buck Jones (I)' (qv))resigns from the Texas Rangers so he can cross the border into Mexico and devote all his time to the capture of Shag Smith ('Jim Mason (I)' (qv)) and his bandit gang who have murdered Jim's young brother Bob ('Don Chapman (I)' (qv).) Using the alias of the Pecos Kid a bandit he recently captured Jim crosses the border with his pal "Thunder" Rogers ('Frank Rice (I)' (qv) and finds Smith and his gang at a cantina. Smith thinks about inviting Jim/The Pecos Kid with joining his gang but is persuaded not to by his henchman Dave ('Lou Hicks' (qv)) who hates Jim because of the latter's success with Tonita ( 'Lupita Tovar' (qv)) the cantina dancer. Jim plots to get Smith and his gang to cross the border into Texas in order to arrest them.
