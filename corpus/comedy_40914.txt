Artur Drmola ('Jirí Dohnal' (qv)) is the spoiled son of a rich family who proclaims to one and all that every young woman retains his interest for three months at the longest and if he were to have a wife it would be no different. One morning the young man still drunk meets his old childhood friend Leontýna Sobotová ('Lída Baarová' (qv)). The young woman reproaches him for his way of life but Artur does not recall from where she could know him. Leontýna is also from a wealthy family yet she works in her father's company. Artur's affection for her completely transforms him and he also begins to work in his father's office. His worried mother ('Zdenka Baldová' (qv)) thinks that something is missing in Artur's life and she intends to have him married.
