On a ship under attack in the middle of the ocean the hero Sonny is brought back to life by an injection administered by a man who introduces himself as Louis. Sonny discovers he is now a zombie but unlike the other creatures swarming the ship he is capable of thought speech and reason though he can't remember anything about his life or who he was before he died. As Louis teaches him how to defend himself Sonny comes to realise he's caught up in something big and ultimately sets out on a journey to find the source of the zombie epidemic and discover who he is and what happened to him. Along the way he meets an unlikely group of allies including a battle-suit wearing and gruffly spoken combat medic named Veradux and becomes embroiled in a bizarre conspiracy.
