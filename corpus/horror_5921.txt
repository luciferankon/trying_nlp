Like all good nightmares Philip's begins with something all too real - his mother's death. The days following the funeral are characterized by nothing save for an incessant feeling of abandonment. Until that is he receives a letter from a dead man. Philip's father left before he was born taking his reasons with him. Now here he is opening up the door from beyond the grave. That door leads to more questions and those questions lead to Greenland. Philip follows the clues - they're all he has left. On leaving the final signs of human civilization behind him in search of the location mentioned in his father's ambiguous notes Philip wonders if he's left some part of his humanity behind as well. Soon that will be the least of his fears. Now Philip needs your help. He's found an inexplicable metal hatch in the middle of a frozen wasteland. Inside is something yet more unfathomable. Step into the unknown.
