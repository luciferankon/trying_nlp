Struggle and Politics are two things that are no stranger to Palestinian-born Nasser Mohet. His father a political adviser to Yasser Arafat sent his only son to live in New York City after 9/11. The story that followed is indicative of so many immigrants no sleep long hours little pay and constant struggles with adversity. The documentary picks up on Nasser having just made a life for himself that is somewhat stable. This relative stability had been earned through sweat and tears and could come crashing down on him at any time. Within 30 days Nasser must meet a quota or be fired from his job selling life insurance pass final exams and make enough money to pay his rent.
