When Voices Rise... tells the important but little-known story of dismantling segregation in the polite society that was Bermuda in the 1950s. Working in secret the Progressive Group organised the 1959 Theatre Boycott to end segregation in movie theatres in Hamilton. Context is provided by those who protested against segregation and the limited franchise earlier in Bermuda by authoring a "Secret Document" that analysed the social problems of the island. The film also features a rare interview conducted in London England with Kingsley Tweed-a powerful public figure during the boycott that changed the island forever.
