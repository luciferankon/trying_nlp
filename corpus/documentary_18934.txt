In the early 1960's the Dallas Cowboys wanted to develop a computer system that would evaluate draft eligible college players. As President and General Manager Tex Schramm stated "find a way to judge players without emotion". It was this sophisticated player-draft system the Cowboys conceived in the early 1960's that would propel them onto five Super Bowl appearances in the 1970's thus winning two World Championships. This story of ingenuity is made more interesting because the key team member has since been forgotten. A. Salam Qureishi a brilliant Indian computer programmer and statistician. A young man whose grew up half way across the world and knew nothing about American football. Up until this system pro scouting was done on hunches rather than hard numbers. Qureishi's programming changed all that bringing the Cowboys' scouting technique out of the Stone Age and into the Space Age. His computer model helped draft such legendary players as Mel Renfro Bullet Bob Hayes Roger Staubach Craig Morton Jethro Pugh Walt Garrison Rayfield Wright Larry Cole Calvin Hill and Duane Thomas.
