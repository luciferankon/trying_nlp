Although supposedly a 'serious' documentary the filmakers went out of their way to film the weird and wicked safari hunts manhood initiation ceremonies hot coal walkers frenzied religious ceremonies where the participants pierce their bodies and so on. This film so perfectly foreshadowed the 1960's mondo craze that the distributors later retitled and re-released it as "Mondo Africana".
