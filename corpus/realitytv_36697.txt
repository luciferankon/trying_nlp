The series opens with the first round of auditions presided over by a panel of music and celebrity experts including; music industry impresario Roseann McBride Chanelle Hayes vocal expert David Laudat and Kenny Ho the celebrity stylist. The eagle-eyed judges spot some potential amongst the inevitable comical and deluded characters and whittle down the hopefuls into a lucky few who will progress to the next stage. Each girl selected hopes to make it through the grueling rehearsals and 'celeb' tasks set by Chanelle to secure their place in the final girl band line-up.
