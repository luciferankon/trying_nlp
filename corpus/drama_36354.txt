1920. Last days of the first Armenian Republic. Armenian Army fights on two fronts: war with Turkish army in the west and Red Army incursion and Bolshevik mutiny in the northeast. Hayk Saroyan returns to his native provincial town from Russia to assume a minor post at Dashnak Army command center. His brother Gevorg captain at the same command center is a real patriot prefering death to "eternal exile" army power to relegious mercifullness. Very soon a suspicion creeps inside him: his beloved brother is Bolshevik spy.
