It is September 1356 and the kingdoms of England and France have been at war for 20 unrelenting years. The land is despoiled and both armies exhausted. At the pivotal Battle of Poitiers a small group of English knights serving under the Earl of Northampton are our focus: the earl's Knight-Commander Hawkyard and his fellow comrade Turold a soldier who will stop at nothing to win. The battle rages and the French King is defeated but Earl Hugo is badly wounded by a French assassin Mauchet. In recompense for his injuries Earl Hugo is awarded Castle Machoul where Mauchet's daughter the Countess Yvette still resides. Yet when the English arrive at the castle they find that Yvette is not as helpless as she seems. In the dark walls of castle Machoul and the lands that surround it someone has reawakened the Loup de Guerre by donning its skin on the captured Turold. The ferocious War Wolf of French legend the stuff of nightmares is now on a killing spree with a bloodlust for English flesh. But the beast cannot truly be controlled and when it begins murdering indiscriminately no one in the castle is safe. Who would unleash such a horror on the land? And is there a hero left in the ranks of the disillusioned soldiers a hero strong enough to override the powers of the War Wolf?
