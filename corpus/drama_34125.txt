This is a story about a unique bond between a young man with creative aspirations and his neighbor an abstract impressionist painter facing the sunset of her life. The fresh bloom of friendship that the new neighbor offers impacts the relative calm of their world. Yet the Japanese woman - with an expiring visa - has her own demons to face. The story explores synchronicity and the fragile ties that bind us to certain people and certain junctures of our lives.
