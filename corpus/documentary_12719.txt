The story of the so called Christian-Communist Republic of the Guaranis. Formed by jesuit missions in Brazil Paraguay Argentina and Uruguay between 1610/1767 it congregated about 150000 indians in almost fifty "Reductions" (the cities organized by the Jesuits). The Christian-Communist Republic of the Guaranis was decimated by attacks of expeditions and mercenaries and served as excuse for the kings of Portugal and Spain to banish the Jesuits from America.
