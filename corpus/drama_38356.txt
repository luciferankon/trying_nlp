'My Life Alternative' is centered around the main character Sophia who takes you on an emotional and musical journey as she begins an internship at an Alternative Rock Radio Station after feeling like she doesn't fit into the life that had been planned for her and wanting to find her own path. Along with our main character you will meet people from all walks of life and hear music that is like no other sound you have heard before. The word 'Alternative' means: more possibilities. The 'Alternative' music genre has been used as a catch-all description for artists that don't receive mainstream recognition and music that cannot be defined by one distinctive category. From the smooth subtle sounds of Bob Marley Jack Johnson & Ben Harper... to the fun Pop-Punk songs of Green Day Blink 182 Sum 41 & New Found Glory... to the California loves Red Hot Chili Peppers No Doubt Pennywise & Sublime... to the all out bad-ass Rock shows of the Foo Fighters The Black Keys The White Stripes & Kings of Leon... to the distinctive tones of Radiohead Arcade Fire The Postal Service & Beck... to the lyrical conquering of Beastie Boys Eminem & Outkast who defines the genre with their name alone. All different all unique and can all be found in one place on your radio dial. Alternative music was and still is the non-category category. Meant for anyone and everyone who ever felt like they couldn't be labeled as just one thing. People say that this era and music was for all the misfits but no person is just one thing we are all mixed bags and Alternative music allowed us to be whoever we were and united us in all our differences.
