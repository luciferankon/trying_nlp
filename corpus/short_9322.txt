This promotional short film advertising the upcoming action film _The Guns of Navarone (1961)_ (qv) includes much behind-the-scenes footage of its filming on the Greek island of Rhodes. We first see the stars of the picture arriving by airplane on Rhodes. They ride pack animals along steep mountain paths to the first filming location. We are treated to two exciting sequences seen in the finished film: the attack by German dive bombers and the famous storm scene in which their boat runs aground on the rocky shore. Afterward we see the stars relaxing from their hard work: Gregory Peck plays soccer with island schoolboys while Gia Scala and Irene Papas patronize the local shops. Helpful and courteous young island boys carry the packages the women have bought. We then see the filming of the dangerous cliff-climbing sequence and finally the firing of the "great guns".
