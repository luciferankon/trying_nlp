This one-hour documentary on the making of diva Maria Pellegrini is a story of natural talent and tenacity triumphing over adversity. The sultry soprano has suffered and survived for more than three decades in the competitive sexually charged and backstabbing world of international opera. Her rise to stardom is filled with sacrifice and heartbreak success and failure - an ironic mirroring of some of the tragic roles she has performed on stage.
