A look at the 40-year career of acclaimed feminist artist Nancy Spero who in her own works is concerned with "rewriting the imaging of women through historical time." With Spero's own voice as narration this documentary tracks her development as she matured against the grain of Abstract Expressionism Minimalism and Pop Art when "there wasn't room in the art world to make way for political or activist art."
