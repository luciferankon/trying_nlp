Animated tale by former Tim Burton art director Deane Taylor has many of Burton's dark themes. Children playing by the sea shore are lured into a time travel portal where they are taken to an amusement park. There they are having loads of fun until they discover that if they don't escape immediately they will be forever trapped there as inanimate objects. This sets them in a frenzy to escape which takes them through a ghost train and a terrifying freak show.
