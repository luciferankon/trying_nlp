A short experimental film that uses non-traditional narrative to address issues of humanity's environmental impact on the system of the planet. The film expresses the various systems (notably humanity vs. nature) through rhythms each system creates. As the systems interact fight and overpower each other their rhythms do the same resulting in an auditory representation of the complex interactions. Ultimately we see the disparate effects of manufacturing the building blocks of life as the systems of humanity overpower those of nature.
