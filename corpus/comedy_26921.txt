A Comedy revolving around five twenty-somethings-including a corporate go-getter a musician a flirt a senator's top aid and a recent college graduate trying to figure out her life. Five people who normally wouldn't be friends but get to know each other when they are bumped from a flight and wind up stranded over night at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport the night before Thanksgiving.
