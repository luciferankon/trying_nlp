The film tells about the life of people after the uneasy truce in Donbas. The distinction between war and peaceful life is erased. Everyday attacks have become a daily routine and home life is tightly intertwined with the war. An evening saunter with the girls in the park gives place to a deadly duel with the sniper the next morning. The local militia whose family had been parted by civil war lost not only his relatives but also himself. The crazy wedding in a dilapidated city and volunteers in search of thrills. This film is about the brutal civil war that has become a part of everyday life. About the ceasefire which doesn't exist.
