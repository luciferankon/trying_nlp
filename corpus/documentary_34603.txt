North Korea lies somewhere between a 1930s Soviet Union frozen in time and a dark futuristic vision of society... as imagined back in the 70s. 'Land of Whispers' invites you to visit arguably the most unique and isolated travel destination in the world - not to criticize but to observe and listen. Aside from usual highlights such as Pyongyang or Arirang this unique one-man documentary brings you to areas such as Chongjin or Wonson still virtually unknown to even Google or Wikipedia. There the director attempts to pierce through the ever-present 'national mythology' and as much as possible he tries to connect with people - such as the waitress mesmerized by tablet computers or a tour guide cautiously fascinated by modern pop culture.
