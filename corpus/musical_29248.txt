Renowned cello virtuoso Yo-Yo Ma embarks on an intense year long collaboration with choreographer Mark Morris which culminates in a spectacular performance. Falling Down Stairs follows Mark and Yo-Yo from city to city documenting their collaborations with remarkable intimacy humor and candor. We see the first meeting of Mark and Yo-Yo as they set down the rules of this most unusual creative experiment. We see Mark struggling to overcome a creative block as he builds new choreography before our very eyes. His dancers run through sections of the suite for Yo-Yo who watches with wide-eyed amazement while accompanying them on cello. Mark conducts Yo-Yo during an actual compact disc recording of the suite and finally the spectacular pay-off as Yo-Yo and the dancers perform the suite exclusively for and with the camera.
