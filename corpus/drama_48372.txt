Ron Weer (Bashar Shbib) is a unpublished writer from the city asked by his employer a publisher to pick up an overdue book manuscript from Yan de Rilke (Jan Kuilman) an isolated writer who lives in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. Yan is suspicious and reluctant. With difficulty Ron manages to gain Yan's trust. They hit it off and Yan allows Ron to read and comment on his manuscript. They argue throughout the day and night about love politics and philosophy. As the night falls Ron is invited to sleep over. Throughout the film Yan's novel is interwoven with the developing friendship of the two writers. Yan's novel Lulu in June tells the story of Lulu (Rebecca L. Rau) a lonely naive and innocent young woman as she adventures with love. Everything seems to be weaving together until the last chapter.
