800 km Hurdles follows two physically disabled friends on their 13 - day trip on a motorbike with a sidecar from Istanbul to Mugla. During the journey retired journalist HÃ¼seyin Eroglu (48) fullfils his dreams of traveling with his painter friend Aydin Erkus (52) in the latter's motorcycle and has the opportunity to get to places on his own rather than -like many other impaired people- being dependent on others. On the way the two friends visit several places of interest. Through these visits they try also to make us ponder about the lives of the disabled their problems the effects of our acts and practices on them and how much the society cares about them.
