A big Prague apartment building is on fire. Mr Novák tenant of the apartment on the sixth floor considers himself the culprit of the fire. On that day his wife had a birthday and Mr Novák went home with a bouquet and was slightly drunk. Thus it happened that he mistakenly rang the bell of the neighboring flat of the Svobodas. Then he sobered somewhat and eventually found the way to his own apartment. The young and pretty Mrs Svobodová was taking a shower. When she ran out to find out who rang the bell wrapped only in a bath sheet the draft slammed her door shut. The desperate blonde rang Mr Novák's bell and forced herself into his apartment where she was soon discovered by her husband and Mr Novák' wife.
