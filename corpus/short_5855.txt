A veteran home-appliance salesman criticizes one of his newly-hired junior staff members for not having a serious attitude. The junior salesman replies that the International Harvester line of home refrigerators is so good that they practically sell themselves; "you can't lose" a sale. To prove his point he bets his boss 25 dollars that he can sell an IH refrigerator to the next woman who walks in the door. When a young woman walks in the salesman makes his pitch by demonstrating all the desirable features of each of the four IH models. The woman agrees to buy one and he collects the bet from his boss--but is the young man already acquainted with the woman?
