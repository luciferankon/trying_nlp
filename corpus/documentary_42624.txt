In February 2005 artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude installed 7500 arches (gates) curtained with orange cloth that waved and billowed and decked miles of walkways in Central Park. The gates stood for 16 days the first unfurled by Mayor Bloomberg who championed the project giving it the okay after the artists' 25-year quest to gain approval. Archival footage shows pro-and-con debates and various mayors and commissions turning down the project. By the end the gates installed the camera travels a winter landscape orange shining through trees and reflected in ponds. Passers-by quintessential New Yorkers express pleasure. Art dwarfs the nay-sayers.
