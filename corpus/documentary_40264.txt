Indie Filmmaker Utpal Kalal and Cinematographer Kaustubh Manchekar travel to the Asaram Bapu's Motera Ashram in Ahmedabad looking to observe the Ashram's reality and investigate the inhabitants living there. They spent 20 days in the Ashram interacting with each of the inhabitants and closely observing each and every ashram activity. They have asked unrestrained hard-hitting questions based on whatever allegations have been put up and tried to research all the related aspects without any prejudice and unabashedly. They watched and analyzed many hours of footage archives and when the filming and research was complete what they had was an unforgettable experience with them a soul stirring reality that has not reached the common man until now. Asaram Bapu who is currently lodged at Central Jail Jodhpur is exercising his legal recourse against the alleged charges of molestation. It's believed that he has been framed in an international conspiracy and gone through the worst media trial ever.
