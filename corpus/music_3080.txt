An actor gets to play Stanislav Binicki an eminent Serbian composer from the end of the 19th and first decades of the 20th century. Since he lacks confidence to play such a role he turns to hypnosis through which he was able to live through the life of the composer and gain faith in himself and also in art. He becomes Binicki himself a pioneer of Serbian classical music. The musical yet anti-war music movie "Binicki" for both children and grown-ups is an attempt to draw the attention of a wider audience towards classic music.
