A dramatized documentary to coincide with the release of Warners' "Thumbelina" directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman. Bluth and Goldman established a Disney-competing animation studio in Ireland in the eighties and nineties and Callan's documentary is part biography part children's fantasy - and also provides a behind-the-scenes look at the making of "Thumbelina".
