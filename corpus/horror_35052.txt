Hell Michigan is a the classic Werewolf tale that is going to bring back the old school style of shooting a very cinematic big screen horror movie. Our story takes place in Hell Michigan which is actually a real town that exists in the backwoods of Michigan. A Midwestern town scientist has purposely opened a gateway to the Underworld in order to experiment on demons using pseudo-science Biblical doctrine and six campers in the woods of Hell Michigan. We soon discover that there is a virus spreading throughout the town that's breeding a type of werewolf creature no one has ever seen before along with supernatural forces that's about to ruin their fun filled weekend. Our werewolf walks on two legs and will be done in the style of the old Universal Werewolf/meets The Thing. This film will be sticking to mostly practical special effects bringing back the days of creators such as the great Lon Chaney and Boris Karloff. We have been fortunate enough to gain full access to the town and all amenities that come with it thanks to the local Mayor of Hell. Director Scott Kodrik has been doing special effects make up professionally in the film industry for twenty six years behind a camera. Indie horror film maker Haynze Whitmore and Kodrik have been labeled the new Coen Brothers of Horror. Making monsters is what they do and this monster is going to reach out of the darkness and drag you straight to Hell.
