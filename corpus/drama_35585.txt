Kurdish refugee Renas is living in the very north of Norway. In a remote desolate house. In the middle of snowy nowhere. But soon his special princess Fermesk will be joining him. Though the couple has never met they have already fallen in love from looking at each other's photographs and talking on the phone. Their families have performed a wedding ceremony back home in Iraq and Fermesk is put on a plane. The first encounter at the airport does not live up to their expectations however. Neither look very much like their flattering photos would indicate. Fermesk is now a much bigger woman and Renas isn't quite the handsome young man anymore.
