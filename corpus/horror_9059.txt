In 2011 Steve the Father of a possessed boy along with Frederick an Exorcist took his son to the woods to rid him of an evil spirit trapped inside of him which they saw only as a last resort as all else had previously failed. Unbeknown to them killing the boy only released this evil in to the woods as well as the boy's soul which now roamed around trapped in limbo unable to be freed and rest in peace. A year later after several reports of seeing the boy most strongly by an old couple on a walk with their dog Hal and Annie along with Wayne and Marie came to these same woods in search him as a large reward was now available. The boy tried to warn them but it was to no avail as Marie became possessed with the evil spirit; she was now being used as a temporary body to get to the boy and claim it back. Marie in all of her peril killed her boyfriend Wayne and attacked her friends before escaping with the boy. Now after more news reports of more disappearances Derek and Ethel aka 'the old couple' returned to the woods to have another go at finding the boy bringing with them their Grandson James and his girlfriend Michelle. After a bit of passion in the woods with her boyfriend Michelle comes across the body of Hal alive but not in the best of shape. They take him to their tent and Ethel keeps him hostage to get information out of him. Hal is freed by Wayne yet despite being killed he comes back as the boy's protector to reunite the group and send this spirit once and for all back to where it came from. Now reunited with his girlfriend Annie along with Steve and Frederick who also return must find the boy before the spirit inside Marie which grows more powerful by the day goes back in to the boy. A nail biting search ensues and with only one chance at this there can be no excuses or error.
