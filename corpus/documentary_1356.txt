On March 5 2010 while filming a snowmobiling segment in the Sierra Nevada back-country Grant Korgan burst-fractured his L1 vertebrae and was told he would never walk again. Despite his prognosis Grant Korgan and his wife Shawna focused on the goal of 120% recovery. On January 17 2012 along with two seasoned explorers Grant attempted the impossible and became the first spinal cord injured athlete to literally PUSH himself ~nearly 100 miles (the final degree of latitude) to the most inhospitable place on the planet - the bottom of the globe the geographic South Pole.
