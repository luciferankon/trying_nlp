The Rose Bowl meets The War of the Roses as two fantasy football coaches go head to head for a season of action-packed trickery. The goal is in sight but rivals Charly and Mitch fumble and foul as they try to outsmart one another in each three-minute episode. As guru troublemaker sidekick and sex symbol The Refrigerator "Fridgie Bear" Perry keeps the plot rushing. Charly "The Tuna" Shapiro is a 35-year-old Weshchester yuppie and fantasy football fanatic married with two dependents. Mitch "The General" Carriati who imagines himself a virtual Vince Lombardi is a 36-year-old ex-jock and ex-husband cigar smoker and New Jersey native. They are The Fantastic Two a toxic combination of comedy madness cheerleaders and no-holds-barred skullduggery.
