In the Central American nation of San Sebastian a group of violent rebels kidnap the American Ambassador Ambassador Porter Worthington (Carreon). The leader of the group is Hernandez (Diaz) who sports some intimidating facial hair and has unpredictable taste in hats. He wants the release of the prisoner Isidro Zapien (Gamboa) and will use entire armies of armed men to achieve his goal. Naturally the one man who can rescue the Ambassador and save the country is Vietnam vet Steve Parrish (Marchini). He teams up with the beautiful Maria (Abeyta) and heads off into the jungle to fight the baddies.
