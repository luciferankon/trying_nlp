Body of A Poet is a lush and beautiful meditation on the life and work of Audre Lorde. Sonali Fernando's film is an imaginary biography of the lesbian feminist professor mother visionary and 'warrior poet' who died of breast cancer in 1992. Avowing the subjectivity and desire with which we view our forebears the film meditates on those moments in a life lived with passion that steel the political will and irradiate the poetic consciousness.
