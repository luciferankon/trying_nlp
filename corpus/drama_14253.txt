The dwarf Jujuba becomes famous and powerful after an unsuccessful attempt of suicide. He receives many letters of sympathy from children and a TV network offers him a show for children. He hires an obscure writer to write his shows with a high salary and gives him the nickname of "Escriba" (obs: meaning who writes). Jujuba is an abusive and mean boss humiliating Escriba most of the time in various situations. Jujuba invites the stripper Patty to his wonderful house as if he were interested in hiring her with an expensive salary for his show but actually with the only intention of having sex with her. When Patty steals the original of the fake contract Jujuba tries to retrieve it and Escriba has the chance of his revenge leading to a fatal conclusion.
