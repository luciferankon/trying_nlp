Don't Go is the intimate story of the lives and loves of a group of vibrant individuals living in a Los Angeles fourplex. These people struggle with the same issues we face every day: love loss change and family. But rather than a static representation of our daily problems this television series introduces us to new characters that may be our neighbors in real life but are rarely seen on our television screens.
