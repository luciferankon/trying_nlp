Tom and Carol Anne Smithson move to the tiny town of Grand Pennsylvania where Tom has gotten a job at the Weldon Piano Works. Tom is soon fired however after his "innovative idea for the future of the company" (making golf clubs at the piano factory) is panned by Mr. Weldon. Mr. Weldon takes a liking to Carol Anne however and hires her. Over the course of the series Carol Anne meets and befriends the working class Janice Pasetti. The goings on of the small town are covered in humorous and often touching detail.
