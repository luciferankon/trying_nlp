The DVD consists of everything we could throw in there such as hidden camera parody man on the street stand-up and music. Oh yeah and of course celebs and hotties. We did parodies on Scarface with the real Steven Bauer Spunk'd with Ashton Koutcher's retarted brother Jimmy Koutcher Cheaters and many more.
