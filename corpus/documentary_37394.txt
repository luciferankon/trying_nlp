The Third Indo-Pakistani War erupted in December 1971 and East Pakistan gained independence to form Bangladesh. Even now more than thirty years after the war some prisoners of war have not been repatriated and their fate is unknown. While the governments of both countries deny the existence of such POWs their families treasure old photographs of the soldiers that still portray them as youths and wait for their return.
