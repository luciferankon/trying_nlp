For as long as he can remember Jacques Desbois has been passionate about winter. Growing up in the snow capital of the world Quebec Canada he found enjoyment in winter but was particularly fascinated with the elements of snow and ice. How did people live outside in that environment? He set out to build an igloo and was hooked. In 2001 he fulfilled one of his dreams and built the first Ice Hotel in North America "Hotel De Glace". Each year 150 passionate workers help to create this incredible structure that's filled with themed ice sculptures representing various cultures and geography. This magnificent Ice Hotel contains 36 guest rooms a grand hall a bar for 400 people and even an Ice Chapel that provides for at least 30 weddings per season. In this stunningly original new documentary history architecture and culture are highlighted along with breathtaking unforgettable cinematography.
