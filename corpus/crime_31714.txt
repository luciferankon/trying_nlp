When a homeless man Carl finds himself alone in an abandoned warehouse with a team of corrupt cops who are prepared to take whatever measures are necessary to find their nemesis a man called Hashim Carl knows the odds are stacked against him. However as matters take a turn for the worse and identities become twisted the truth is finally revealed. Carl an apparently innocent homeless man is dragged into a derelict and foreboding warehouse by officers from a supposedly covert police team who start to question him about a shoot out at a local casino that has left four people dead. However as the questioning and subsequent techniques become more intense it is clear that rather than finding out who killed the people in the casino the team are looking for a mysterious man called Hashim. Carl and Hashim served in the army in Helmand together and while Carl has ran out of money and luck his former colleague has created a powerful crime network of his own and now wants to force his way into the local underworld. It transpires that the police team is led by a corrupt and volatile detective called Mallory and when he turns up the interview soon turns malevolent. Mallory wants to find and kill Hashim who he sees as a threat to the empire he has built and will stop at nothing including doing whatever it takes to Carl to find him. However as the interrogation intensifies and the officers start to lose control it becomes apparent that neither Carl nor some of the police officers are telling the whole truth and ultimately that truth will destroy one or all of them.
