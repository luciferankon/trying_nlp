Presented as an inquiry into the ways of lust this film is staged as a documentary. It moves from rural prostitution (the roadhouse) to pornographers then on to streetwalkers male hustlers and high-class call girls. The madam runs the bordello she depends on the photographer to supply her with pornography; he's in the city using his camera to lead him into depravity. The streetwalkers risk arrest from the cops and abuse from the johns. Even the call girls have a tough time: from their expenses to their lack of self-reflection. Their motto: "Live fast die young and make a beautiful corpse."
