On the Northern beaches a group of friends says goodbye. Twenty years earlier in a flat in Paris departure is postponed. Even if we hide our faces under the blankets even if we chew our cereals really hard we can still hear the banging doors. There are ages when we think we leave too far and there are those who leave for good.
