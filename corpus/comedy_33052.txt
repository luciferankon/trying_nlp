It is Friday and in their flat in a modern Prague housing estate the Novák family are getting ready to go to their weekend wood cabin. As usual when they get there they quarrel. They are extending the cabin but they can't get hold of the right planks. On Monday the working week begins again. The father Karel ('Petr Kostka' (qv)) works in research for the Tempochron firm the mother Eva ('Jorga Kotrbová' (qv)) is a hairdresser the older daughter Mirka is at high school and the younger Jarka is at basic nine-grade school. The whole week is marked by hurry.
