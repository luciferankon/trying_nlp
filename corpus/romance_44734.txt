Shekhar informs his parents his dad and his stepmother and together they all go to Choudhury's house to finalize the marriage. At this point Shekhar's stepmother asks for a hefty sum as dowry which the Choudhury is unable to afford and thus the proposal for marriage falls flat with the Choudhury vowing that he will get his daughter married elsewhere.
