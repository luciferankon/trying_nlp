Originally formed in Cork Ireland in 1966 by Rory Gallagher Taste had a brief but influential career releasing two studio albums in 1969 and 1970 and disbanding shortly after their legendary appearance at the 1970 Isle Of Wight Festival which is the centerpiece of this film. The core of "What's Going On" is the band's performance at the festival on August 28th but it is encapsulated by a documentary on the history and importance of Taste and setting the scene for their Isle Of Wight Festival appearance. This features contributions from Rory Gallagher's brother Donal along with Brian May (Queen) The Edge (U2) Bob Geldof and renowned guitarist Larry Coryell. Rory Gallagher would go on to enjoy an acclaimed and highly successful solo career and this electrifying show by Taste is an early example of Rory's justified reputation as the ultimate live performer.
