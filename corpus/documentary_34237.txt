The film "Interruption" tells the story of a hostage situation of which the hostages are unaware. The director Yiorgos Zois aimed at creating a condition in which life imitates art through improvisation while forming a unique setting for the filming process by placing most of it inside the hermetically sealed though still exposed space of a theatrical stage. The documentary follows the filming process closely exploring the complex multilayered world of "Interruption" where theatrical myth mingles with reality making the viewer both a protagonist and a pathetic consumer at the same time.
