Bill Goodman is a slick wealthy celebrated psychiatrist who leads a double life. He has a wife and daughter in New York. At the same time the bigamist has another wife in London. Despite his long absences on 'business trips' both little families lived in domestic bliss totally oblivious of each-others existence. Alas the wives find out about each-other place in Bill's well-organized life and let jealousy get the better of happiness; they even team up and turn on the man who so cunningly made everyone happy for so long... Practice makes perfect even if you don't practice what you preach. Seems celebrated American marriage counselor Bill Goodman has engineered the ultimate life of double happiness (a.k.a. a lie). The formula? Two wives. Two lives. And his soul mates aren't losers either. Rose is a best-selling romance novelist up in New York while Charley's a pianist in London who just so happens has zero tolerance for flying. But Bill's picture perfect double life gets a double exposure when Rose finds a love letter in his pocket and jets off to London to meet her competition. Together Rose and Charley work to put a serious dent in his long term family plans and his frequent flier mileage.
