An accountant Nikos Agathonikos is a model citizen and one day when he finds a bag with fifty million drachmas in it (although he faces serious financial problems) he hands it over to the police who then return it to its owner an industrialist. The hero is declared the most honest man of the year but this honor becomes his downfall. He loses his job and the woman he loves. He is renounced even by his own brothers. He turns for a job to the industrialist who sends him to Cyprus to transport drugs. Nikos is under the impression that he is transporting powdered sugar used on lokums (Turkish delights); the customs officers don't suspect him and the "industrialist" and his ring have a booming business on their hands. At some point an old fellow-worker who has established her own ring interferes and claims a share. Nikos' integrity and naivety however lead to the arrest and conviction of the entire gang.
