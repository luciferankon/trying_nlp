After her solitary and baleful prayers a stern old woman leaves her apartment for the laundromat leaving behind a young boy. At the laundromat she's importuned by a young woman who questions her sharply about a man in the old woman's past. Back in her apartment a young couple talks in the bedroom. Is all of this in the old woman's head? Is she reliving her past from which there is no escape?
