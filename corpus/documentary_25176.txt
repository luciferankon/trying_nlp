Disney's ALADDIN INDIANA JONES Warner Brothers' cartoons of crazed Middle Eastern villains international terrorists... These are America's pop culture depictions of Arabs and Muslims. With TV's PROMISED LAND director Nicholas Dembowski creates a clever montage of found footage from Hollywood movies cable news networks European news broadcasts American Westerns etc. The accumulated evidence powerfully asserts that Western media has long demonized a catch-all "Arab/Muslim world" via selective coverage and dehumanizing imagery that boosts the "good vs. evil" rhetoric of politicians and pundits like George W. Bush Colin Powell Condoleeza Rice and Bill O'Reilly. By offering no narration or other commentary of its own TV's PROMISED LAND lets news outlets Hollywood and politicians incriminate themselves.
