Aster McGrath embraced his brutal nature as a child. How could he not? His father was imprisoned for murder and his alcoholic mother abused him and his little sister. The town of Bayville Mississippi labeled him long ago as a bad seed. When Susan Blackman moves into town she sees something in him no one else does; she sees good in him. Her gentle spirit draws him in and slowly melts the icy exterior of his heart. Will the good she finds within him be able to overcome the evil lurking deep inside? Or will the violence he seeks to bury break through the surface and seek blood? Can good come from a bad seed?
