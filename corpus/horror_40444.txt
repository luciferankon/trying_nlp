Low budget horror film has a conspiracy of vampires in a small town (made up of the local sheriff mortician town doctor and ambulance driver) creating accidents of some sort so they can operate their blood drinking dinner parties unnoticed. A small-town funeral director doctor and sheriff are vampires who suck blood from the recently not-quite-dead on the embalming table and then immediately kill the newly converted vampire. When one of their victims disappears before being staked they are threatened with being exposed if the new vampire surfaces. Very low budget. Based on a true story?
