Though years have gone by some of our friends just haven't managed to grow up. Namely Crawford Briggs. Though now dating best friend Bonnie Morgan he can't help but obsess over former girlfriend Megan and her current boyfriend Eric. Meanwhile Bonnie's ex Max Lauder works in the kitchen at The Green Mill Tavern along with Kim the waitress he cheated on Bonnie with; the very SAME Green Mill Tavern that Josh Goldman and Keri Loring plan to enjoy their fourth anniversary dinner at despite being unable to shake perpetual hanger-on Larry Stark. Coincidences and fate are on the menu as a nice evening out turns into a disaster that happens to come with a side order of fighting conspiracy and breakups. Another old friend is there Quentin Lynch along with his girlfriend Saffron Thompson just trying to enjoy a quiet evening that will likely never happen. This follow up to both The Leslie Situation and Accidents combines both casts into an epic story of love revenge and farce. With a fudge brownie for dessert.
