The Earth is fully stripped of natural resources by the fifth millennium. As a result the Earth Empire sends out expeditionary sleeper ships to distant planets found to have abundant natural resources and harvest them. The discovery of hyperspace technology accelerates the Empire's interstellar expansion. As the colonies become more prosperous the inhabitants become discontent as most of their mined resources are used to benefit Earth. A peaceful insurrection in the 47th century only results in the Earth Empire's leader the Tzar personally leading the destruction of a rebellious planet. Stunned by the carnage the other colonies band together as the League of Free Worlds with a man known as the Father leading the fight.
