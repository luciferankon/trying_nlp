The representation of the devil in Mexican cinema almost always comes in the from of parody. It is normal for Lucifer to appear in a comic way trying to lead humanity astray from the right path. Villanis watch from the darkness in order to find the way to stop the innocent ones' happiness. They are characters capable of ruining the life of the most decent woman. Melodrama is a genre that needs villains so that after the tale's initial misfortune the story can come to a happy ending. Perhaps the effectiveness of those old films is due to the fact that they recreated a world of dreams where good knew how to triumph and evil was always defeated.
