Audrey called Drey is 15 African-American a Brooklyn high school student a Tootsie-Pop usually in her mouth. She lives in a flat with her mother and older brother. Her mom is tired working double shifts. Audrey is an observer. She finds one of her teachers Mr. Dunne interesting. He's white with curly hair and pork-chop sideburns. Sometimes his lectures are philosophical. He keeps to himself. One evening she surprises him in the locker room: is he taking drugs? He offers to drive her home. Her anthropological study of Mr. Dunne continues. She goes to his classroom at noon to ask a question and to leave a gift. Only connect.
