Five teenagers head off for a weekend at a secluded cabin in the woods. They arrive to find they are quite isolated with no means of communicating with the outside world. When the cellar door flings itself open they of course go down to investigate. They find an odd assortment of relics and curios but when one of the women Dana reads from a book she awakens a family of deadly zombie killers. However there's far more going on than meets the eye. In an industrial facility two technicians are preparing for their day on an unknown operation. Meanwhile five friends are preparing for their trip to a remote cabin owned by Kurt's cousin. On the way they stop for gas and have an encounter with the strange local who owns the gas station. While drinking and relaxing at the cabin they discover a basement filled with interesting artifacts.
