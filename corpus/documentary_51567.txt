On 17th December 2010 Mohamed Bouazizi a penniless fruit seller in the provincial town of Sidi Bouzid in Southern Tunisia set himself on fire.

After 23 years in power President Ben Ali had become a master of state repression adept at controlling the message and crushing dissent but in less than a month he would be gone starting a wave of revolutions that would fundamentally change the face of the Middle East.
