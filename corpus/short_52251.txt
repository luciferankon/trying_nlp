Johannesburg 1993. Meat sizzles on an open braai. An Afrikaans girl watches her father shatter an empty bottle. She takes a plastic bag filled with broken glass and follows her baby brother up a rickety ladder. They perch on top of the wall. She dips a spade into an ice cream tub; slaps a layer of wet cement between her knees. Her brother hands her a shard of glass; she wedges it into the cement. He plays catch with a piece. She eyes a passerby warily. The glass slips through her brother's fingers falls at the passerby's feet. He picks it up; hands it back.
