On his family's farm in rural Iowa young Jack Gudmanson is wrestling with his sexual identity not an easy thing to do in the macho world of the Midwest. But things become clearer for him when he discovers via a rusty old lunch box filled with gay magazines that his father killed in Vietnam led a double life down on the farm. But as liberating as the discovery is for Jack it is painful for his grandfather and mother who have tried for years to keep it a family secret. Now Jack must decide whether to share this new information with his younger sister or allow it to remain buried a while longer.
