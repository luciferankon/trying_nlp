Releasing on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the dreadful Tsunami of 2004 Prabhu Solomon has used this natural calamity as an important prop in his film Kayal. The story as evidenced in the trailer is very simple and centers around the love of a young couple. But the difference lies in the way Solomon treats this simple premise peppering it with interesting anecdotes that add value to the main theme. Aaron (Chandran) and Socrates live their life to the fullest by working for 6 months and spending their hard earned money by visiting all over the country. During their journey they get caught near Kanyakumari for helping a couple to elope from the town. In turn Aaron gets to meet Kayal (Anandhi) and fall in love with her at the very first sight. But due to quirk of fate they are separated as Kayal experiences for the first time the awakening of love in her. A wandering duo is wrongly suspected for aiding a girl fleeing from her marriage and held by the thugs at the girl's household who use the housemaid as bait to get clues from them. That is when the hero falls for the maid (of course at first sight!). He shakes up the scene with a proposal that plays on the girl's mind even after the hero is set free. They go in search of each other & when they meet on the 26th of Dec 2004 they witness the devastating Tsunami!
