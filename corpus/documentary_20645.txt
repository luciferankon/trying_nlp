The IFS - Popham Arboretum is one of the few naturally regenerated forests in the world. This arboretum which was once part of a wasteland is today the last surviving forest patch in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Sam Popham a world war veteran purchased this land to cultivate mangoes. But later he changed his mind and let the natural vegetation take over his land. This led him to pioneer what was to be called the 'Popham method'. This is a short film that gives us a message of how nature can heal itself if we don't intervene.
