Over ten episodes Jack and Holly countdown to Christmas by listing their ten favourite things they like about this time of year. Some are obvious some are not. The usual suspects are covered in some detail. Santa Claus gets most of the attention (as you'd expect) Santaland is a new addition to the fairytale and the inclusion of polar bears and penguins give a wildlife perspective to the climate most commonly associated with Christmas time. There's a great deal of educative explanation and the narrative moves away from the traditional Disney-eske type story presenting itself as more of an animated pre-school observational documentary!
