Jill and Michael Stark are both deaf as are their two children. Stuck between two cultures and wanting the best future for their children they make the controversial choice for both of their children to undergo surgery for cochlear implants. They are part of only a handful of deaf parents in the US to choose implants for their children. After this seven year journey was the result of the cochlear implant what they had hoped for? At risk of being ostracized from the Deaf Community deaf parents Jill and Michael Stark make the controversial decision to have both their young children also deaf implanted with a device called a cochlear implant that may one day allow them to hear.
