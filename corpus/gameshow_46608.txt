Richard Dawson hosted this TV game-show which pitted members of two families against each other. Each team tried to guess the results of survey questions faster and more accurately than the other team. 2 families by each of their family's last name. 1 a returning champion "The Winning Famliy" & 1 Challenging Family compete to match answers to a survey question (e.g.: "Name a famous George") in which 100 people were surveyed. The "Family Feud" Survey Board consists of positions from 3 to 12 and features the number of people said of the answer to a survey question from 2 to 80 people that'll (never be) adds up to $100. Dollar figures that adds to the bank. Double Survey Question ($200) in 1976 & Triple Survey Question ($300) added on March 5 1979 (1st introduced in the syndicated portion in 1977). The families tried to name the most popular answers (No. 1 survey answer) given in that survey before getting three "strikes" (answers not given on the survey) they're out of the question and doing so allowed the family to steal the bank by naming just 1 answer not yet revealed. The game was played until one family collected $200 in 1976  $300 in 1979 & $400 in 1984 wins the game and with all "The Winning Family" playing "Fast Money" for $5000. In "Fast Money" 2 family members separately tried to name the most popular answers (No. 1's) to 5 questions with 200 points required to win $5000; anything less than 200 points earned a consolation bonus of $5 for every point (e.g. 150 points meant $750). In the syndicated portion which began in 1977 2 new families competed per show with the Fast Money round being worth $10000 with the game being otherwise identical to the ABC daytime show.
