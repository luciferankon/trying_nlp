Survivorman's Les Stroud hosts this look at how best to play it safe in the water while testing popular theories of how to survive shark encounters. Les travels to the Bahamas and South Africa to test whether the behavior of Caribbean reef sharks and great whites changes depending upon the time of day. While in South Africa Les and marine biologist Jeremiah Sullivan conduct an analysis of the great white's bite and test whether kicking and splashing attracts sharks and if it's safer to stay in a group or tread water alone if stranded in the ocean.
