Tex Taylor has met the heroine on one of his visits to Los Angeles. He is owner of one of the biggest ranches in Texas and she is a daughter of a Colonel buying horses for the Government. He is invited to a dance by the Colonel and comes in his old clothes as he is traveling light yet has given his promise to appear. The foil to the hero is another horse buyer agent for the Allies who loves the girl. The bandit messenger mistakes him for Tex and entices him out of the ranch while the punchers are doing the honors to the Colonel and his daughter. The girl follows this man out and is captured by the Mexicans for Phul. This gives Tex a chance to ride over the Rio Grande to rescue her by his own right arm and skill. The cowboys after being fooled for a minute beat off the raiders and then the girl and the hero come riding back on the same noble steed.
