No Humans Involved examines the shocking perfunctory police investigation of the murders of forty-five San Diego women between 1985 and 1990. Director Simeon Hutner contrasts the emotional devastation of the women's parents with the cold-hearted assumptions of local law enforcement officials that no one would care about the women many of whom were drug users prostitutes or transients. A chilling indictment of a system where police label murder victims as "NHI's" -- "No Humans Involved".
