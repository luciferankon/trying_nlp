Everything is bigger in Texas! As Leslie moved from California to Dallas with her pageant queen God-daughter we find her meeting a new group of women and their daughters at the local country club. As they try to fit in and find their place we get an intimate look at the mom-daughter relationships for all they are and for all they are not. Just three seasons but entertaining for all with a lot of growing up life lessons and lessons on what not to do. We learn about love loss forgetting and forgiving. Everything just may be bigger in Texas but also richer in more ways than one!
