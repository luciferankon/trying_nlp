My Invisible Empire is inspired by a true story of the daughter of the Imperial Dragon of the KKK. One small child fighting for her own survival. From the time she was born until she became an adult in a forbidden underground world of terror; her father a cold calculating murderer who never became a suspect even in the death of Martin Luther King Jr. Women adored him men honored him even his enemies feared him. The faith of this child would save hundreds of thousands of lives.
