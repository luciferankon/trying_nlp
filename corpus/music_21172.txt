From October 22nd to 25th 2008 Coheed and Cambria play four nights at Terminal 5 New York City. On each of these four dates the band performed one of their concept albums telling the story of The Amory Wars. The first four discs of this DVD set capture these performances set in front of sellout crowds in their entirety. In addition a fifth disc features a documentary of the concert series.
