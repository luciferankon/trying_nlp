This expansion of Edu-Ware's "Space" role-playing game includes two new scenarios: Shaman in which your character launches a career on an untamed planet as a religious practitioner trying to amass followers; and Psychodelia in which you can enhance your characters' attributes through mind-alerting drugs at the risk of physical danger.
