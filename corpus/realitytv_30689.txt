Ten home potters return to the home of the British ceramics industry Stoke-on-Trent to compete in the second series of the show. Judges master-potter 'Keith Brymer Jones' (qv) and ceramic-artist 'Kate Malone' (qv) will scrutinise their work over three gruelling challenges. For their Main Make the potters must throw and decorate an identical sixteen-piece dinner set. Then their technical prowess will be tested in the Spot Test the potters must sponge decorate a coherent design across a pair of jugs. Their work will be assessed by a special guest judge one of the UK's most popular ceramic designers - Emma Bridgewater. Their final challenge is the Throw Down where the judges examine the potters' skill at the wheel and they must throw the tallest cone they can in just 15 minutes. On the final day their dinner service will be removed from the kiln and examined with the best set going on display in the show's gallery but someone will be heading home.
