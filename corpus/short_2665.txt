George Johnson and his wife Annabelle have moved to the farm to live what George terms "the good life." We discover that George has several unusual ideas on how a farmer can "clean-up" by "throwing a few seeds around" for "it's natural for things to grow." Annabelle's kitchen garden proves a success but George's first corn crop produces only nubbins. George then meets an elfin character Mr. N (played by Billy Barty of Hollywood) who shows George the way modern fertilizers are utilized in farming whether in the citrus groves of Florida peach orchards of Georgia winter and summer pastures tobacco land of the Carolinas cotton in the southland and wheatlands of Kansas. Through the operation of the Marshall brothers in Missouri Mr. N illustrates good farming techniques in raising corn. As Mr. N concludes his "preaching" George asks why he never heard of him before. Mr. N assures him he would have "if you'd been a real farmer." George hurries to tell Annabelle of his strange experience and starts his explanation of how to grow corn. Annabelle interrupts to show George "her green thumb" a sack of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.
