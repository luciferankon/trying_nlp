Based on the drama by Rocco Familiari Black Sun is rooted in the facts of an event that transpired two decades ago. Agata and Manfredi is a young couple in Catania deeply in love and growing happier as time goes by. When Manfredi is shot and killed Agata emerges from her shock with a desire for vengeance. Once she identifies the murderer herself she methodically seduces him in order to exact a confession. Zanussi's film centers on a woman who like many Sicilians is inherently distrustful of a justice system that veers toward leniency and inaction. Almost philosophical in tone and rich in symbolism the film is universal with its idealistic romance and vows of "forever" while being simultaneously singular. Valeria Golino as Agata turns in a performance that conveys the hope and drive of a woman on a path towards tragedy.
