Disunion with the Union of Suffering illustrates and applauds the complex design of the human form - from cells to flesh - and celebrates the amazing cognitive ability each human possesses to transfer perceptions. Using images of cells anatomy and butterfly metamorphosis the film creates an atlas of the subconscious mind. The vivacious score and staccato rhythm of vibrant single-frame images alerts us to the working of our own eyes and ears.
