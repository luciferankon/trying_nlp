Tourné lors de la grčve chez Goodyear ŕ Joliette nous pouvons suivre la révolte des ouvriers québécois.--------------This militant documentary (made by members of the Collective of the Comité d'information politique and originally planned as the first of four films) was intended to politicize Quebec workers. It begins with an acute visual analysis of the capitalist system and then allows workers involved in various labour struggles to speak about their experiences and voice their thoughts on the radical transformation of society.
