Three groups of two contestants each face up to each other. One stands in front unable to see their partners and presses the buzzer while the other answers the question. The longer waited before buzzing the more points available - however the "buzzer" must risk that their partner knows the answer. Hence the onus is on the buzzers to try and psyche each other out while still getting points. This continues until one couple are left who then buzz for each other for up to ≈Å1000 per question.
