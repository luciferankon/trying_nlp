There is just one citizen standing in the way of famous entrepreneur-turned-politician Fatty Bonati's total subjugation of the Big City: a diminutive unimpressive vigilante known as "The Karate Tortoise." Most tortoise than martial artist this red belt has taken it upon himself to steal and consume all of Fatty Bonati's famous pizza. Armed with a band of freakish supervillains Fatty sets out to capture the Karate Tortoise to make his five star tortoise pie. But just when the going gets tough Karate Tortoise enlists the help of a pair of unlikely apprentices: an ass-kicking Damsel and a washed-up marathoner Dust Bunny. Together the three Tortoise Revengers fight Fatty Bonati's super villains as they embark on a quest to topple Fatty from power-- and nab all of his delish pizza in the process of course.
