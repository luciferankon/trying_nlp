The answer depends on whether the respondent is someone of American British Cameroon Columbian German Indian or Turkish heritage. What if that person traveled thousands of miles crossed a few continents grabbed couple of languages and ended up in the heart of Europe? What if that person carries genes of two continents? What if that person changes back and forth between different genders? What if that persons feels most comfortable in the middle of nowhere? These are some of the characters you will encounter in "Identities"!
