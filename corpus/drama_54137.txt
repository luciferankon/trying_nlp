Abigail is a typical teenager. When an angel tells her she's been chosen to have God's child her first instinct is to look for a way out. Family and friends aren't much help: Mom is too fed up with her to listen her stepfather can't understand her her real father has moved on. And her boyfriend has begun to suspect her of cheating on him. Eventually she abandons her comfortable middle-class life for the streets of Boston where she hooks up with a group of runaways led by the enigmatic Sultan. But just when a new kind of happiness starts to feel within reach Abigail suddenly finds herself more alone than ever. Drawing on Dreyer Godard and "Joan of Arcadia" Absent Father is a meditation on love freedom and the quest for grace in a complicated often chaotic world.
