A two day program that challenges high school students to think about the consequences of drinking and driving. Day one begins with students assembled in front of the school to witness the dramatization of a fatal alcohol related collision. Emergency personnel transport the injured to the local hospital a passenger is declared dead by the medical examiner and the driver - now murderer - is given a field sobriety test and arrested for driving under the influence. Witness to this tragedy are the "living dead": students who have been removed from their classes by the Grim Reaper. Notices of their "deaths" are read to the student body by a California Highway Patrol Officer. The program culminates the following day with an assembly featuring the participants and other powerful speakers.
