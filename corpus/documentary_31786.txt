M.C. Escher is among the most intriguing of artists. In 1956 he challenged the laws of perspective with his graphic Print Gallery and found himself trapped by an impossible barrier. His uncompleted master-piece quickly became the most puzzling enigma of modern art for both artists and scientists. Half a century later mathematician Hendrik Lenstra took everyone by surprise by drawing a fantastic bridge between the intuition of the artist and his own and completed Escher's work mathematically. This story was made accessible to all audience and most magically presented in this 52-minute film awarded for best visual effects at the 3rd Bangkok Science Film Festival in 2007.
