Based on F. Dostkeyfski's "The Meek One" this is the saga of a Bombay-based antique dealer-cum-money lender who at the age of 40 marries a woman who is 17 and brings her home to his spacious flat in a multi-storied building with a magnificent view where he lives with his Bua. Their marriage is not a happy one even though he hopes it will get better. But the bride who had lived her live in an orphanage is immersed in her own thoughts and at one point even held a revolver against her husband's head while he was sleeping. Shortly thereafter he confronts her that he was aware of this incident and that the revolver did contain one bullet. Watch what impact this has on their lives.
