This movie was based on a story concocted by mixing the plots of two famous novels "Silas Marner" by George Elliot and "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte BrontÃ«. Initially movie was supposed to be solely based on emotional complexity of Silas Marner character (played by Nazir Baig) his adopted daughter (Sahiba) and biological father (Izhar Qazi) but later director (Hasan Askari) of the movie thought that movie might fare better in Pakistan if violence & drama of Jane Eyre can be blended into the story.
