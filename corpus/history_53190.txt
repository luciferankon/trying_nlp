With Steno & Stilling on 24 guided tours towards Danish self-understanding. Every single day thousands of Danes walk past monuments and memorials without having any idea why they were erected. Every single monument is a modest chapter in the collected work of Danish history. What event was so important that a monument was erected in memory of it? Who made the decision to erect it? Who paid for it? How did they decide which artist should be commissioned to design it? Is it an idealization that borders on falsifying history? Many of these questions will be answered in each of the 24 episodes by the host Torben Steno and his friend the sculptor Kenn Andr√© Stilling. Through the visual monuments in public spaces we will aim for a greater understanding about what is important to us what we as Danes are actually proud of and what we think should never be forgotten.
