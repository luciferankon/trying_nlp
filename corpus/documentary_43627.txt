La Strada Di Parma(The Streets of Parma) is a brief encounter with the people of Parma Italy. The Beauty of the land and glimpses of the Treasures that are located there heck some are even buried! With Castles and Palaces it is like walking through a fairy tail and some of the most famous Christian artwork ever is displayed in this town of love.
