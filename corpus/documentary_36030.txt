The poet called Ticho (Silence) is brooding in a Prague caf√©. Prague is the meeting point of those who support the location of the American radar in the Czech Republic and those who are against. A dialogue with an amateur film-maker is followed by a summer lecture on metaphysics. A police cordon puts an end to another demonstration and the end of the film witnesses some long-haired youngsters putting on parts of the police outfit. This is the Czech Republic in 2007 - fragments of stories and relationships little pieces that in its diversity reflect today's world and in its otherness suggest various associations.
