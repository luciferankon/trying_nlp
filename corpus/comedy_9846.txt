Anand Mathur a middle-class Mumbai businessman has no end of troubles trying to deal with his five wild daughters. There's Meenakshi the eldest a vengeful feminist ever ready with her rolling pin; Radhika an intelligent but semi hearing/visually-impaired girl who often consequently causes misunderstandings; Sweety a man-hungry idiot who dreams of marrying Shah Rukh Khan (and for that matter any handsome man she sees); Kajal a wannabe gangster with connections in the Mumbai underworld; and finally Chhoti a teenager with a tongue for both food and gossip. His wife doesn't help either - overweight Bina Mathur always takes the side of her children and takes every available opportunity to henpeck him. In the midst of this fray there is the ghost of his deceased first wife the mother to his first three daughters (whom only Anand can see and communicate with via her photo in their house). With all this it's a wonder Anand can survive each and every day for all five of his children get up to some schemes shenanigans etc. that never fails to create pandemonium in Mumbai!
