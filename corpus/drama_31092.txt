Dallas Jordan is an award winning screen writer. He falls on hard times after finding out that he has been diagnosed with a rare heart condition. While in rehab Dallas pens a script that details his triumphant rise from being raised without a mother down to his pitfalls of the addiction that forced him to rehab. His script lands on Hollywood's blacklist. He uses this as an ultimatum after tracking down his biological "has been" actress mother. Loosely based on the life of Jason Juliano.
