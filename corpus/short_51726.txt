He's Jimmy getting ready for a date. She's Jenny and she's coming over to his place. He's made a to-do list: he's shaved and showered now it's time to pick the mood music and get dressed. He tries various stations on his FM imagining how the date will play out with each one: a country-music debacle a tragic Russian dirge (in black and white) a comic caper with saccharine pop a lounge-lizard disaster and finally a mix tape she's sent him. Has he finally picked the right beat?
