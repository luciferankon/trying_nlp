Hosted by Brian Williams. A look at one of the defining chapters in John Kerry's life: his week in Washington in April 1971 protesting the war as a leader of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. His activities that week (especially his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) received national attention and made him the newest star of the anti-war movement. He also became a target of the Nixon White House which set out to undermine and discredit him as documented in once-secret White House tapes and memos.
