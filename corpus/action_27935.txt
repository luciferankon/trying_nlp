A new Weapon: On 1st September 1939 the German Wehrmacht attacked Poland and thus triggered the Second World War. In the beginning of the war the German troops gained a lot of territory in only a short period of time. Poland the low Countries and France were overrun within just a few weeks and so the term ''Blitzkrieg'' was born. The reason for this incredible speed lay in the cooperation of battleplanes infantry and the use of fast tank formations. Since the last years of the First World War where slow clumsy giants rumbled over the battlefields almost all European militaries underestimated the use of tanks. This turned out to be a momentous mistake.
