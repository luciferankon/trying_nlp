Pedro Amstrong is not exactly happy. His intolerable wife Carolina harasses and mistreats him; his children ignore him royally; and his boss who is also his father-in-law drives him up the wall. Pedro should't...but he dreams of being free of all his obligations and at his 40 years of age he decides it's time to make a change: giving his two weeks' notice at work separating from his wife and taking on the project of remodeling an old house which he will share with other gentlemen that are separated just like him. At first they enjoy themselves but things get complicated when the ex-wives - including Carolina the children mothers mothers-in-laws and their caretakers all start coming around.
