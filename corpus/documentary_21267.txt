An intimate film A rare one that aren't about anyone particularly newsworthy and yet tell a story so real and relatable that it sticks with us. We Said No Crying starts out like many home movies do: recording a young couple's decision to start a family. Following the ups and downs of two extremely likeable people the film showcases not just the high drama of making a new life it also documents a love affair you'd be lucky to find at the multiplex.
