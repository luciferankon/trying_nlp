One Day Tafo is a uniquely poetic film exploring the spiritual historical and cultural connections between Ghana and Denmark through the personal family heritage of the filmmaker. Through the intimacy of this personal perspective we are taken to Tafo a small town in Ghana where the filmmaker returns for the first time in 30 years. The family situation in Tafo provides a strikingly effective micro-cosmic view of the general transition from colonial to the modern world.
