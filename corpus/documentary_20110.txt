Through the prism of big data psychometrics advanced techniques of persuasion and micro-targeted surveillance White Space Conflict contemplates Donald Trump's US Presidential election victory and a dystopian 'big-brothery' future. The film's central voice is that of Alexander Nix CEO of data mining and strategic communications firm Cambridge Analytica notorious for its role in Trump's Electoral College victory.
