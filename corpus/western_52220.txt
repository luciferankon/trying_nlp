This film is so filled with modern trappings (1950's) and gimmicks that it appears to have been intended for Roy Rogers and is written in the typical take-no-prisoners style of toughness perfected by Bob Williams. Rex Allen and pal Homer Oglethorpe are treasury agents working undercover with a traveling horse-circus act after a gold hi-jacking gang that doubles in counterfeiting. Crabby rancher Nap Wellington and his daughter Madeline are the early suspects but only until Hays Lawson shows up. The climatic chase scene involves a helicopter a horse the Mexican secret service and a flying Rex Allen that gives Republic's outstanding corps of stunt-men a chance to shine.
