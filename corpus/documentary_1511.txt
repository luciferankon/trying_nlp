A mini-series that created portraits of fathers from very different walks of life: a teen dad struggling to break a cycle of fatherlessness; a factory worker discovering that he too can be involved with raising his daughters; and a CFO juggling the demands of a high powered executive wife and two small children. Hosted by former Senator Bill Bradley the program aired nationally in 1998.
