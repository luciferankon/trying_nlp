Meat production increases every year but many people still have no idea what's on their plate or what it has taken to get it there. "We eat meat but killing animals doesn't really happen" says philosopher Florence Burgat. She is one of the many experts who have their say in director Manu Coeman's fierce indictment of the industrialized meat industry. LoveMEATender is packed with facts and figures particularly in the first half presented through clear comparisons and playful animations. The objective is to demonstrate the consequences of our excessive meat consumption: for the animals for the earth but also for our own bodies. Even people with very tough skin will have to swallow hard when seeing some of Coeman's shots. Chicks that are chucked down a funnel with a thud floundering cows at a slaughterhouse geese having food violently forced down their throats. Yet at the same time LoveMEATender isn't a pessimistic film. Coeman's approach is hopeful and he also shows us how things could be done differently.
