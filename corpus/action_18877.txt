Bandido sa Sapang Bato proves it as it depicts the usual little barrio setting. The whole Santa Maria is being ruled by greeds until Daniel Batolo a bounty hunter famous for his bravery and love for justice acts according to his strong principle. People loved him for that but some especially ones craving for power envied him and started plotting baits to break his good image.
