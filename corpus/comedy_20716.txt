Alisha Trunnell is a television reporter from New York who flies into Detroit on assignment to explore the trend of photographing derelict buildings; a practice that is commonly referred to as "ruin porn." She expects to interview local residents and get quotes about how photographs and videos of vacant buildings can distort one's perception of the area. She quickly however discovers one of the city's most guarded secrets. During one of her interviews she learns that those vacant blighted buildings she learns are in fact filled with porn stars having sex with random people.
