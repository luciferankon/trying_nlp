With no idea of how to retrieve the money to avoid debt Nao is desperate. When she gets a tip that a genius swindler Shinichi Akiyama is about to be released from prison she turns to him for help. With some initial reluctance Akiyama agrees to be her right-hand man in the game. As the two get pulled deeper into increasingly difficult levels of the game it gradually becomes clear that their participation was far from coincidental.
