Restore explores the life of a commuting urban public through the eyes of the lead character portrayed by Jonathan Groeneweg. As a major intersection and event space in Toronto the Dundas Square is traversed by thousands of people daily. Large multinational companies pay thousands of dollars to aggressively push their products in urban centres - such as the Dundas Square - further perpetuating the hegemonic consumerist model and exacerbating society's reliance on brands as a means of socioeconomic stratification. The ensuing commodification of natural resources to facilitate the related development places increasing pressures on many fragile ecosystems; many of which we depend upon for our survival. Restore is a call to action to reclaim our environment and in doing so to reestablish our true values.
