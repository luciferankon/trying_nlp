On the 3rd of March 2368 The CDF Goliath was dispatched to investigate a loss of communications with the Icarus Colony. The CDF (Colonial Defence Force) lost contact with the Goliath not long after they jumped into the Icarus System. Before sending in any more CDF forces it is common practice to send in an ASET (Advance Scientific Evaluation Team). An ASET is comprised of 2 specialists from the CSD (Colonial Science Division) who determine if there are any biological or scientific threats which would impede a salvage team's efforts. You play the part of Dr. Jake Abbots who goes onboard the CDF Goliath. Your partner Dr. David Riggs (Shaun Phillip Cantwell) is mission control he stays behind on the CSD Alexis and guides you from there. You have radio contact with Dr. David Riggs and he will give you objectives advice and help you throughout the game. Or at least that is what is meant to happen as you will soon find out. With multiple storylines and random gameplay events every new game will offer something new.
