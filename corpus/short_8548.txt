Footage of several wars news broadcasts stock footage surveillance video commercials video games a modified version of the United States Terror Alert system and John Giorno's spoken word performance piece "Subduing Demons In America" are edited together to represent an extreme caricature of the constant visual bombardment an average American citizen receives almost on a daily basis via the media. In a way the media becomes War Itself and the numbing hypnotic result is nothing less than a version of Anthony Burgess' "Ludovico Treatment" from the novel A Clockwork Orange.
