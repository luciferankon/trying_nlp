StopThePain804 is a documentary that was born out of need. TV & Film Producer Craig Santy and Police Chief John Venuti of VCU worked together on a crime reality series for A&E called Crime 360. Santy produced the series and Venuti and his team worked the cases all homicides. The two decided something needed to be done about the violence that was tearing the city apart from within. The StopThePain804 documentary took a major step towards changing the way people especially young people view violence. "If we can change the way people think about violence we can change their behavior" said Chief Venuti. The StopThePain804 film ignited a full-scale anti-violence movement within the City of Richmond supported by the Chief of Police the Mayor and dozens of public and private organizations. The film was shown in public schools juvenile justice programs and at community groups and churches- an unprecedented move in order to reach as many at-risk individuals as possible with this important message. To date it has reached more than 4000 at-risk young people. StopThePain804 encourages everyone to be a part of the solution. Together we can StopThePain.
