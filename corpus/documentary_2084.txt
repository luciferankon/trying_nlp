Camp Casablanca tells the experiences of a group of Swiss soldiers and officers serving during a 6-month mission with the Swiss contingent of the international peace troops KFOR in Kosovo. The volunteers of the Swiss troop are neither professional soldiers nor collaborators of international relief organizations with international experience. They are workers or employees finding themselves coping with a reality which has nothing in common with their own.
