Documentary filmmaker Matej Bobrik turns the camera on himself at a time of change in his life defined by his relationship to two women: his grandmother with whom he talks only on the telephone ever since the recent death of his mother and his new Japanese wife whom he married in part to help her deal with the Polish authorities. Tellingly Bobrik records only moments of transition but not their causes or consequences.
