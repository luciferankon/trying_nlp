Jerrold Jarvis Jones a lowly shipping clerk falls asleep on his office stool and has a dream: He is an aggressive carefully groomed man of the world who welcomes adventure when an attractive girl addresses him as Tourvaine and takes him on an automobile ride. He is taken to a meeting of a secret criminal society known as "Children of the Night" and is mistaken for a new leader who was to arrive from abroad a role he assumes until exposed. In a series of fights with the crooks he rescues Sylvia (in real life a secretary in his office) and mingles in the world of high society. Awakening from his dream he is fired with ambition and astonishes everyone by walking out with the stenographer.
