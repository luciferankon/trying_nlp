Recorded over 16 years Paul Atherton has captured on video every visit his Cardiff based estranged son has had staying with with him in London. Edited from over 200 hours of footage this film highlights the restaurants galleries museums theatres walks events father and son Charles Atherton-Laurie have shared together. It questions the conceit that bringing children up in London is a bad idea and also demonstrates what's capable when a father is desperate to show his son another world from the one he inhabits. The father's love of London is clearly reflected in the love for his child.
