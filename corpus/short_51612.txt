The story of a young medical illustrator Megan who is having serious doubts about her chosen profession. The world of medical art is not the scientific community it once was: aesthetics are valued over accuracy imagination over information. Megan's peers seem more concerned with art than anatomy drawing organs from memory and adding interpretive embellishes to spleen diagrams. But Megan is not content walking the line between abstraction and representation-she needs something concrete to grasp on to. Possibility presents itself in the form of Randy a middle-aged cemetery grounds keeper. His tendency for the occasional grave robbery gets Megan's gears turning. Would it be so wrong to dig up a dead body in the name of science? Could it pull her profession back on track? The realness of an exhumed corpse draws her. But before Megan can dig like da Vinci she's got to convince Randy her peers and her best friend Carlo-a sarcastic aesthete who thinks she's crazy. How far will Megan go to satisfy her desperate yearning for objectivity?
