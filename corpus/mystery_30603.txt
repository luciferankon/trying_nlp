Set in 19th century Delhi our story takes place at time when technology and science are still in their infancy and modern tools of investigation haven't yet been invented. While Bahadur Shah Zafar II reigns ostensibly the British might and influence increases each day and with it a spate of crimes. As crime multiplies the police grapples to keep up with the mounting unsolved cases. Under these circumstances when the Kotwal finds himself in the midst of a felonious mystery he seeks the help of the only man who can come to his aid - Mirza Jaan Nawaz. Though eccentric in his methods of investigation Mirza proves himself time and again unravelling a new mystery with every case. Without the aid of technology Mirza relies on the most potent tool of all - his brain. With an equal measure of intelligence and looks Mirza Jaan Nawaz knows how to maneuver every situation. The ladies want him and the men want to be him. But Mirza only has eyes for his love Zeenat from whom he often seeks counsel. But even this man of mystery and strength has a past that continues to haunt him. As he moves from case to case he gets closer to confronting his own demons and finding answers for himself. Blessed with support from the Kotwal and his son Shyam Mirza cracks down on the criminals through his powers of reasoning and observation delivering justice to Dariba's citizens only on Dariba Diaries.
