Smoky Knights is a fictional account of the real life band in Los Angeles. Well Burbank really. We follow the stoner-musicians in their every day lives living in a two bedroom apartment with Andy's type-A girlfriend Kim. The series incorporates the real music of the band. Also the band is called the Smoky Knights if you didn't get that.
