He looks like Jesus Christ. And preaches like St. Francis of Assisi. Some say he's "a kook." Others "a blessing from God." Barefoot and clad in a white robe he's walked through 47 states [and 13 countries] on a 16-year mission that's captured media attention from 20/20 Time and the Wall Street Journal. Yet who is this solitary figure who inspires faith - and attracts controversy? "The Jesus Guy" covers the mystical journey of America's "Barefoot Evangelist." In a nation that worships money he's penniless. In a culture that idolizes celebrities he's forsaken his identity. Now on a spiritual quest even he doesn't fully understand his faith - and your own - will be tested every step of the way. WIth the intimacy of single-camera filmmaking director Sean Tracey allows us to walk in "The Jesus Guy's" steps as he encounters both skeptics an! d believers changing them...for better for worse forever.
