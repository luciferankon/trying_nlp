This social film attacks Bombay's industrial parvenu class initiating the realist-reformist melodrama as a genre. It tells of the street hawker Devdas who goes to the city to make his fortune but once successful becomes an exploitative cotton mill owner and a callous snob knighted by the British. There is a violent factory worker's revolt. His wife the kindly Hirabai is made to suffer and his daughter Rukmini is dishonored.
