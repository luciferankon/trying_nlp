Two men and a woman. The first wants the other the other wants a career and the third wants a family. This film made with psycho-dramatic methods tells about the absence of empathy. It is about the personal fears that separate us and about the fundamental social problems that determine the experience of otherness and attitudes to it in present-day Hungary.
