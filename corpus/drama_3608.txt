Four narratives weave their way through the tragic slums of Bogota to the lofty hills of Hollywood. A 14-year-old prostitute girl and an ill-fated eccentric American writer forge a strange companionship. A Colombian university student invites a terrible danger into her world in the name of financial solace while a day-care teacher in Los Angeles does everything she can to fight the weight of a tragic secret.
