The Nicktoons Animation Festival was an annual event that was created by producer Fred Seibert and produced for its first three years by his Frederator Studios. The festival featured a selection of animated shorts from around the globe. Shorts selected for the festival had the chance to be aired on Nicktoons Network online and to be showcased at a live event in Los Angeles in October. Several prizes were awarded each year. Animators under 18 years old were eligible to enter the Greater Creator Contest. 2009 was the final season of the festival.
