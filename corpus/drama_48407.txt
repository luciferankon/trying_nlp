A man enters a long-term care facility on Christmas Eve armed with a syringe and a camera. He's there to see his elderly father who is autistic and has been paralyzed for 20 years following a car accident confined now to a hospital bed. His intention is to put the man on trial: he blames his father for his difficult childhood of not being there for him and for ruining his dead mother's life. He's come to put an end to the miserable old man and to film it all. But first over the course of 24 hours he is made to suffer through physical and psychological torture. The only reprieve the frail and deteriorated old man gets from his sadistic and cruel son is when the hospital staff interrupt to feed and wash him and change his diapers. Ironically this is far worse than his son's torture as he has to deal with the daily pain humiliation and loss of dignity of having to depend on others to take care of his basic bodily functions. Vulnerable and helpless he has no choice but to endure.
