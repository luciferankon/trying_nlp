The Chipaya live in the desert plateau of Bolivia near the border with Chile: they are the last Urus to speak their native language unknown to the other populations. They say about themselves that exist from before the birth of the sun. The people around who know the skills to be able to live in an arid and difficult particular territory call them Chipaya but they prefer to be called Qnas So≈Ñi the People of Water.
