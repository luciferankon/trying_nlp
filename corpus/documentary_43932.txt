Tibet - the mystical roof of the world peopled with enlightened monks? Only one of them wouldn't toe the line: Gendun Choephel the errant monk who left the monastic life in 1934 in search of a new challenge. A free spirit and multifaceted individual he was far ahead of his time and has since become a seminal figure a symbol of hope for a free Tibet. A rebel and voluble critic of the establishment Gendun Choephel kindled the anger of the Tibetan authorities. The cinematic journey through time portrays the life of this unorthodox monk revealing a face of old Tibet that goes against popular clich√©s. The film makes an abundance of unique and rare historical footage available to the general public for the first time. But it does not dwell on the past; rather it skilfully oscillates between tradition and modernity. Archival images of ancient caravans and monasteries give way to scenes of discos and multi-lane highways in Lhasa where pilgrims prostrate themselves as they circle the holy temple. ANGRY MONK offers a fascinating insight into a country whose eventful past is refracted in the multiplicity and contradictions of everyday life. Ultimately this road movie also tells the story of a man who left home to search for something that could have liberated traditional Tibet from its rigidity. An outsider who was always open to new things he eventually became a stranger in his homeland and homeless in foreign lands - a wanderer between worlds.
