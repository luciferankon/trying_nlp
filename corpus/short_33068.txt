Little Eliott's parents are upset because his grand-mother Matheline is coming to live with them and she is obviously very ill. Upon her arrival she tells Eliott that his grand father has left for a trip to Chicago a long time ago and will never return. She may take that trip too pretty soon because she is very tired. Although Florence the mother thinks her son is old enough to deal with the truth when Matheline leaves she just affects that Matheline went on that trip. And maybe she did.
