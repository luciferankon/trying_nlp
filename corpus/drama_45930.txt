Munich 1955: A sports journalist meets Veronika Voss an UFA actress who supposedly had an affair with Goebbels. Now declining Voss is kept by her "kind" doctor Dr. Katz supplying her house food clean clothes and her favourite: morphine. Voss trying to come back towards the cinema cannot perform an absurdly simple scene but it attracts the attention of the journalist who suspects that something's very wrong regarding her doctor. In the 50's in a rainy night in Germany the sports reporter Robert Krohn offers his umbrella to the former successful UFA actress Veronika Voss but he does not recognizes her. Later she calls him inviting for a drink and he finds an unstable and decadent actress living in her past success. In a mixed sensation of love empathy and curiosity Robert has an affair with Veronika and discloses a dangerous gang leaded by Dr. Marianne Katz that addicts wealthy patients in morphine to get their fortune when they die. Veronika was a film-star but has consumed too many drugs. She hasn't got casts nowadays and she is under treatment with her nerves. Her doctor takes advantage of the situation. Patients give away houses and other valuables to get some drugs. One day Veronika meets with a sports reporter.
