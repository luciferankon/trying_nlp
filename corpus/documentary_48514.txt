Come On Down!! is a documentary film about two friends who venture west to crack the greatest game show in television history. As (A) and (B) cameras roll viewers tag along with Wordsley and Rags as they road-trip from Boston to Cali in hopes of striking gold. What they find along the way could beat a Double Showcase... or could it?
