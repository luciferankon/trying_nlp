Col. Jessup of Mayville does not waste any affection on his young wife who finally runs away with a theatrical company taking her son with her but leaving her baby daughter. Later she dies and the boy known as Byron Bennett is leading man for a theatrical company playing one night stands. The season however has been disastrous and the company is about to disband when they receive word that the house is sold out for the performance at Mayville; so they hang on. However the manager collects the receipts for the performance and takes the first train leaving the company stranded. Byron who is known as Buddy secures a position as Instructor for the Jessup Volunteer Hose Company which is to give an amateur theatrical performance. He persuades Grace Jessup's father to allow her to take the leading part in order to out-do Hose Company No. 1 which also plans a performance. Grace becomes interested in Percy Pennington a traveling salesman. He tries to persuade her to elope but she refuses until he makes a definite promise of marriage. He boasts however to Buddy and his friend Skinny and intimates that the promise will not be carried out. Soon after he starts out riding with Grace. Buddy is suspicious and follows on a bicycle but is outdistanced. At last however he sees the horse tied by the roadside and hears Grace scream. Rushing to her assistance he overcomes Percy and carries Grace home in a fainting condition. Col. Jessup thinking Bud is the culprit fires at him twice. One bullet lodges in the shoulder while the other is stopped by Buddy's watch in which he carries a picture of his mother. Grace regains consciousness and explains matters; and Jessup is amazed to find the picture in the watch is that of his wife. The doctor advises that Buddy will recover and there is a reconciliation between father son and daughter.
