Paul Case is a lone cop who goes it alone. He is a bit jaded and fed up with his work in the NYPD. He is a defiant cop who needs to fall into line. Now he is assigned a new partner that he sores but must accept as a backup. Paul and Maxine are now assigned to a tough case- infiltrating a infamous drug cartel. The Colombians are moving drugs throughout the city and forcing their will on average citizens. It's up to Paul and Maxine to track down the highest levels of the cartel and end the illicit operations. But Paul is increasingly disillusioned and must prove himself to be a smooth-talking point man known as the Fixer.
