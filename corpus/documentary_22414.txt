Native from Chaudron first Reunion island's housing project Luciano and his friends stage a concert to celebrate their 25 years of musical career. They tell the story of KOM ZOT their reggae band born from to violent riots that occurred in February 1991. They peacefully go on through their music to struggle to protest and to resist. With KOM ZOT and artists they supported Chaudron voices scream their pride. I follow them with a feeling of constant and restrained emergency that make there strength and dignity .
