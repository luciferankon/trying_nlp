In the mid-nineteenth century Everett Nordill was a seemingly honest family man who doted on his wife and children. But in getting his children to perfect copying the signatures of others Nordill was able to produce better than perfect counterfeit money. After the government's criminologists failed to track down the counterfeiter they called in a curious detective with the code name Operative 10. Operative 10 quickly discovered that a man named Everton which was only an alias for Nordill was the counterfeiter. But Operative 10 had to wait for Nordill to slip up as Nordill never passed on the counterfeit money himself. Operative 10 was counting on Nordill's work to be just a little too perfect for that slip up to occur. This Passing Parade short is based on the exploits of counterfeiter Everett Nordill one of the cleverest counterfeiters who ever baffled the agents of the U.S. Treasury department.
