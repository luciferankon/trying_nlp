TRES is innocence lost; three stories of intense emotional connection captured in a fleeting moment from three outstanding directors. A young boy shares an afternoon with his beloved father before being torn away by his mother in A CASA. When a gorgeous bathing beauty spots an Adonis as her lunch date a perfect day at the beach turns surreal in TERÃ‡A FEIRA EM COPACABANA. And in VIAGEM a young man's virtue gives way to passion and intimacy in an unexpected union with a prostitute.
