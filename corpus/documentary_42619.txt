The highly decorated captain Eric 'Winkle' Brown tells his life and career. During WWII he was a fighter pilot on a make-shift aircraft carrier (a modified banana boat!) of the Royal Navy. When it was torpedoed he was one of the two survivors. He became then an instructor. In 1945 he tracked down famous German experimental planes as the first fighter jet Me 262 and the rocket plane Me 163 Komet. He was test pilot for almost 500 different types of planes.
