Major Les Hiddins _"Bush Tucker Man The" (1987)_ takes to the outback once again to tell tales of survival in the Australian bush. The title is a bit of a misnomer because they didn't all survive but Major Les shows how they could have done if they'd had his extensive knowledge. The tales include stories of early explorers gold prospectors and people who crash landed or were shipwrecked in the wilderness of northern Australia.
