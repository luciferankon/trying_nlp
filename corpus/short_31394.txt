It's not just another night for Disco Donny and his flashy Trans Am at the local club "T.G.I.F." (Thank God It's Funky). Upon hitting the dance floor Donny immediately hypnotizes with his smooth dance moves catching the eye of Starla a wide-eyed girl that's new to the big city. She falls for Donny instantly but her boy friend Juan steps in to set Donny straight. A magical dance-off ensues and after some intervening action from the bartender Ruckus Roboticus Donny and Starla dance off into eternity.
