James Francis "Ginger" Coffey has no luck finding a job in his native Ireland and him being a dreamer he decides the place to find a job is Canada. He moves his wife Vera and 14-year old daughter Paulie to Montreal in hopes of a better life. After six months nothing has changed and his family despise their new surroundings. The Coffey's do have one thing in their favor: a rich friend named Tom who lands Ginger a job at a Newspaper. It's a dream come true for Ginger who always fancied himself a journalist and he waltzes in expecting a reporting gig and a by-line on his first day. The blow to his pride is almost too much for him when he discovers the job is as a proofreader but he accepts it begrudgingly. The job does not pay enough and Ginger is forced to take a second job as a delivery man for a diaper-laundering service. Just when things are going well Ginger's pigheadedness and unfounded self-importance cause him to make poor choices and his life begins to spiral downward again.
