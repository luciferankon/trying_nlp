Moses Maimonides wrote The Guide for the Perplexed circa 1190 a Jewish philosopher''s response to the perplexities of the12 th Century. The film follows Maimonides'' footsteps from Cordova (Spain) through Fez (Morocco) Acre Jerusalem Hebron Cairo (Egypt) ending in Tiberias. Its events take place in an area torn between religious fundamentalism and secular materialism resenting and yet drawn towards the merican culture of rating swaying between war and peace. aimonides comments on the film''s events is quoted from his works. Are they still relevant to perplexities of the 21 st Century?
