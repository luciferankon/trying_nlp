In 2017 Michael Fleischer traveled across South-East England documenting the passion and dedication of members of theatrical and operatic societies involved in staging the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan - "The Mikado" "The Pirates of Penzance" "Patience" "The Sorcerer" "Trial by Jury" and others. The film follows their struggle to keep the legacy of Gilbert and Sullivan alive and to survive in the process. At the same time it is Michael's very personal story documenting his love affair with the Savoy Operas.
