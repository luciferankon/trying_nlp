This is the re-make of the film 'I (1962) Athina ti nyhta'; this time however the role of the photography director Aristeidis Karydis-Fouks is more central to the plot. The leading actors of the film wander from club to club in Athens and the so-called "plot" allows the viewer to see some of the most notable acts and listen to some of the musical hits of that time performed by renowned artists.
