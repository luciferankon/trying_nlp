One night Jocke realizes that his little snow globe is a gate into a magical world. Jocke and Jessie decide to run off into this magical world in order to stay together. They enter a 2-dimensional fairy world where the only limitation is their own imagination. The little snow globe acts as a map to aid the two children in their search for the broken stars far up on the mountain. During this taxing adventure they run into strange characters who help them on their quest. At the same time Jocke is beginning to worry about that something hiding in the dark is following them.
