A German immigrant to a small American town is a barber with four children. He has saved enough money to invest in a savings-and-loan company with a friend. Unfortunately one of his sons has been stricken with tuberculosis and the investment money goes to pay for the son's treatment in Arizona. Twenty years later the wastrel son of the now-rich man who was to have been his partner falls in love with the barber's daughter.
