In the tradition of _Sunday Too Far Away (1975)_ (qv) this independent film is based on the classic Australian play by 'John Power (II)' (qv). Pic tells the story of a group of miners living in a camp in outback Australia. They swear brawl gamble and drink heavily. Central to the story is the conflict between Tarzan the authoritarian group leader and cocky loud-mouth wisecracking Pansy. This results in a bare-knuckle punch-up for the movie's denouement. Exteriors filmed in Andamooka South Australia.
