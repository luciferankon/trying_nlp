The term "Mule" is used to describe a person who smuggles drugs across a border. The film tells a story of three young Europeans who fell victims to a momentary lapse of reason and currently serve their terms in prisons around South America. By following their daily lives and dissecting their deepest motivations the film reconstructs the breaking point which turns young optimistic people into mere beasts of burden.
