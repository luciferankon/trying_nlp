The film l'Amatore (the Amateur) is a journey within the intimate folds of a well-known architect Piero Portaluppi who worked during the twenty years of Fascism through the discovery of his work in the present and through his film journals; unreleased 16 mm archives shot and edited by the architect. A charming and powerful man Portaluppi lived through this magnificent and tragic era with indifference and irony without restraints and by creating beauty. In the meanwhile history relentlessly marched on in step with the events of the times.
