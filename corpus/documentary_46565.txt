Just 25 years after gaining independence from Russia Lithuania is facing occupation again. The airspace above the Baltic States is now one of the most dangerous in the world. In the face of the biggest aggression in Europe since the Second World War this documentary tells a story of people desperately trying to preserve peace against imaginable odds. But the film is not about the war it is about peace and the people willing to fight to preserve it.
