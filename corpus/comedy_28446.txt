Bobo Noir (French for "spoiled Parisian brat") is a pastry arts dropout with a heart of gold (or opal his birthstone). His dream: become the black John Belushi. His skill: awful-awesome. His parents -- a Sorbonne professor of 19th-century Namibian watercolors and a Montgolfier Prize Winner in toy plane aviation -- have banished him from the family olive oil fortune. But a one-way ticket to Los Angeles and a cousin convalescing in Mexico have given him a summer in SoCal to pursue his funnyman dreams.
