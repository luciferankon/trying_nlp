Formulated because of the '80s resurgence of the popular Monkees phenomenon the New Monkees show saw four teen-ish boys - this time Larry Jared Marty and Dino - sharing a wild & spacious house together as their aspiring band attempted to land a recording deal and in the meantime kept falling into one crazy situation after another. In keeping with the earlier Monkees format each episode also featured music videos and silly sketches aimed at its target audience with material updated appropriately for its decade.
