Stradbroke is a small island with a big history. The only way to and from Straddie is by barge or ferry which has kept the small community isolated from mainland Queensland. There are only 2500 residents but the group are diverse. Miners business people artists scientists surfers and a strong indigenous community. Debate has raged about preservation of the environment and cultural heritage but what unifies the eclectic mix is a love of their island home.
