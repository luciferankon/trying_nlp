This very pathetic and artistically acted little drama shows a poor fellow in rags who is nearly famished from hunger coming to a house where he spies a boy eating a large piece of bread. The poor fellow asks the youngster to share the food with him and when the selfish boy refuses the starving man snatches the bread and runs away. The boy calls to his family who armed with clubs start in pursuit of the fleeing stranger. After a long chase they overtake the unfortunate fellow near a little stream and but for the interference of a young woman who defends the helpless man from his assailants he might have fared badly. When his pursuers have retreated the poor beggar accompanies his defender as far as her home where she leaves him. The brave girl has made such an impression upon the unfortunate fellow that he is reluctant about leaving so seats himself upon the steps of the house in the vain hope that he might again speak with the kind-hearted girl. Soon the young woman's lover comes along and takes his fair one for a stroll through the beautiful country where they make love to one another as they slowly walk along closely followed by the poor tramp. Unexpectedly the young couple meet a girl on the road who also holds a claim on the young man's affections for he has been making love to her and when she sees the youth in the company of another woman the jealous maiden whips out a knife and makes a lunge at her rival. At this juncture the poor tramp jumps between the women and receives the death blow thus sacrificing his life for his protectoress.
