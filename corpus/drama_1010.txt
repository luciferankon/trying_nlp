The Last Time is an interwoven tale of multiple addicts who face their addictions in one night. Each addict has their own story to tell and their own demons to face. The addicts are visited by addiction personified as a Man in Black or a Woman in Black. This film will show that regardless of your stance on addiction being a disease or a choice - at the end it is simply a struggle and everyone has one.
