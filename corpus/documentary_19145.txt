Ten teams 40000 gallons of oil and a $1 million prize. In the wake of the disastrous Deepwater Horizon oil spill the X Prize Foundation launches a first-of-its-kind oil spill cleanup competition the Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X CHALLENGE. Its goal: to revolutionize the oil spill industry. Over 300 teams accept the challenge from major firms to garage tinkerers but only ten are chosen to compete head-to-head in the world's premier oil spill test facility. To win the $1 million prize they must prove their inventions can collect over 2500 gallons of oil per minute -- three times the highest cleanup capacity ever attained. It's a seemingly impossible goal but these ten competitors will stop at nothing to prove that today's seemingly crazy ideas are tomorrow's world-changing breakthroughs.
