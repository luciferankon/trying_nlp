Kara Bayram is a poor farmer living in a Turkish village with his wife 3 kids (4th on the way) and his old mother Irazca Ana. They live on their own until another villager Haceli who is backed up by the Mukhtar (local administrator of the Village) starts to build a new house right in front of their's. Kara Bayram and Irazca Ana do not accept these uninvited neighboors from the first day and unwanted events start right away.
