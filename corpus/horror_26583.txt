Josh Holden plays a hit-man who is hired to off a scientist who is working on a cell regeneration formula. The hit-man (who Holden later named Angus and made a side story for him) injects the scientist with his own formula which kills him. However neither the hit-man or the greedy company that hired him know the full extent of the formula. We're about to see the results.
