Biro candidly charts one man's epic journey across Uganda Cuba and America. Based on a true story this eloquent and unflinching film charts the journey of a young boy from a war torn Uganda to his days as a soldier with the Ugandan insurgency of 1979 to his HIV positive diagnosis in Cuba to a present day jail cell in Texas. Ultimately what we discover is a man who in the face of adversity will do anything to survive even if it means going to hell.
