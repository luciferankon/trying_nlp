Performing at a lawn fete. This is a decided novelty in acrobatics. Surrounded by a background of trees with the soft grass of a carpet this man woman and child go through their various acts with great dexterity. The child stands on his [sic] father's shoulders jumps turns a somersault and alights on the woman's shoulder with an accuracy the envy of many an amateur. The man does some great tumbling; and the woman some backward somersaults that are very interesting indeed.
