Willis Newcomb and Bart Carroll head a gang engaged in smuggling wanted-American criminals back into the United States from Mexico. Operating from Sharperville an oil town on the American side of the border they transport their human cargo in oil drums loaded on trucks. Border Patrolman Tom Sharper intercepts one of the trucks but is overpowered and left for dead. Carroll having already been paid for the job and not wanting any evidence to walk around get caught and lead back to him backs the human-cargo trucks to the edge of a cliff and sends the drums crashing to the boulder far below. Judge Cookie Bullfincher and Border Patrolman Roy Rogers conduct a search for the missing Tom but the crooks have gone back for him and find him in a state of amnesia. They rob the bank and pin it on Tom. It is now up to Roy to clear his friend and also put an end to Carroll's human-smuggling racket. Criminals are being smuggled back into the United States hidden in what appear to be oil barrels. After taking their money the criminals' barrels are tossed down a hill into the water behind a dam. Roy discovers the operation and brings the bad guys to justice. Newcomb is having criminals smuggled back into the country in oil barrels. After getting their money he has them killed. His communication is by carrier pigeon. Suspecting Newcomb Roy has the next pigeon shot down and is ready when the next shipment arrives. But Newcomb is a step ahead of Roy and captures him and his men. They are then put into the barrels to be the next victims.
