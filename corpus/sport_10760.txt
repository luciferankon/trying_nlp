Yoga Journal's excellent series of videos offers a thorough beginner's guide to yoga stretching and breathing practices. Patricia Walden's soothing voice and gentle approach to teaching eases the viewer through several stretching techniques never rushing and often repeating exercises "so that the body can learn." Walden's slow approach is also "permission giving"; she talks the beginner through each stretch suggesting ways to breathe and enhance even the most seemingly static pose yet never pushing the viewer beyond his or her comfort level. Who would have thought the classic standing mountain pose could wear a person out? The tape is a good hour long and may leave the viewer feeling refreshed and more aware of his or her body. One can't help but be a little inspired by Walden's fantastic and realistic body. She is easy on the eyes yet not intimidatingly so. The production value on this video is excellent and consistent; the music is pleasant even and subtle. The exercises synthesize into one hour-long routine ending with a relaxation pose so breaking it down into shorter segments is not as easy as with other Yoga Journal tapes. All in all an excellent and accessible beginner's guide to yoga.
