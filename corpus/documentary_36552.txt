Viva! Saint Agrippina is a documentary that takes place in Boston's historical North End. Since 1914 The Saint Agrippina Benefit Society have been hosting an annual feast in honor of the martyred Saint a tradition which originated in Mineo Sicily. Society Members tell the tales of Saint Agrippina's short and tragic life. Rather than exhibiting any heavy religious point of views this film focuses on the stories of Her devoted members and how She inspires them to reunite each year to celebrate family friends and this age-old Sicilian tradition. "Viva! Saint Agrippina" takes you through the precedings of the feast from pre-planning behind the scenes and finally to the lively 3-Day event which takes place each year on the first weekend of August.
