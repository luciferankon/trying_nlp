Stockbroker T.T.Ralston has promised his neice Gwen to double it if she can raise $20000. for charity. But he connives so those she asks refuse to give her more than the $10000 she's already raised. Gwen secretly gives T.T.'s new partner Steve Bennett the $10000 and asks him to double it. Later in a discussion with T.T. business partner Dick and client Van about truth in business Steve bets the $10000. that he can tell the truth for 24 hours. Having already accepted an invitation for a weekend on T.T.'s houseboat Steve is subjected to 24 hours of attempts to get him to lie or divulge the bet which would lose him (and Gwen) the $10000.
