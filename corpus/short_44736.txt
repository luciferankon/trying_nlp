A story told through the eyes of a parrot. He alone remembers the metamorphosis of the modern figure of the Anti-Hero Anonymous. The narrative is deconstructed into areas of color from which emerge "flashbacks" of fictional and documentary fragments filmed in Rio de Janeiro: scenes reenacting the Brazilian "cinema novo" traces of Amerindian sacrifices and recordings of urban occupation evoking the spirit of the "Theater of the Oppressed". The color - all at once skin gesture word voice - structures as much as it breaks creating a sort of vanishing punctuation a punctuation of the memory operating on itself.
