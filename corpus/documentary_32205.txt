Kfar Shaul was once the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin. In 1948 Jewish Militia forces conquered the village killing over a hundred citizens. The village houses remained intact and the place was turned into a mental health "village". A BORROWED VILLAGE follows a group of forgotten Palestinian and Israeli mentally ill patients living side by side within the asylum and surrounded by a society that lives in a constant state of "madness."
