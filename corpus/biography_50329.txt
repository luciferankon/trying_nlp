Starting from this maxim of Hemingway the film is depicted through the metaphorical figure of a child accompanying us on a journey to discover the places and events lived by the American writer in Italy paying particular attention to the two macro-periods in Veneto: the first in 1918 where the writer is along the Piave front as a volunteer of the American Red Cross; the second in 1948 when he returned to Veneto to savor the beautiful Venetian life and cultivate his hobby for hunting and nature. The passage from the cinematic part (with accurate reconstructions of the sets in the original places) to the documentary (rich in archive images even unpublished) is always tended to favor in the viewer the perception of a product in which the two parts are perfectly amalgamated dosed among themselves.
