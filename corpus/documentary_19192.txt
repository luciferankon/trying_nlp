As liberals and conservatives were incapable of reaching an agreement the dispute regarding the liberal Constitution of 1857 led to a costly cruel and prolonged civil war that exceeded the predictions of both sides. An age-old political enmity divided rural Mexico into two sectors: one governed by conservatives from Mexico City and the other governed by constitutional president Benito Ju√°rez from the port of Veracruz. Upon consummating the War of Reform the military triumph of the liberals validated this once polemic constitution as well as the Laws of Reform thus burying the secular hegemony of the Church and giving way to the modern lay State we have today.
