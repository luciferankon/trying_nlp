(1968) Lang Jeffries Fernando Sancho Femi Benussi Carlos Gaddi. A unique Euro-western with the hero as an astrologist who wears a leopard suit. Sure theres a revenge theme but overall this is a different brand of spaghetti. Its very moody and feels like a Euro-horror film in spots. Aka Requeim for a Gringo Color 16mm
