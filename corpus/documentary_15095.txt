This nearly four-hour film encyclopedia takes us on a tour of Thailand's many religions including various forms of animism Buddhism and Hinduism. Footage is limited to images of rituals all without commentary and accompanied only with information on the location and the text of short excerpts from the prayers. In the immense length of the film the individuality of each ritual dissolves into a flow of colors lights shouts dance song music voices and exploding firecrackers. It is an encyclopedia that does not emphasize differences but blurs them.
