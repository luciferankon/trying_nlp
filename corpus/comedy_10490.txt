This film is about 5 college girls who are all best friends who need to make some money to keep their boyfriends. So what better way to do it than signing up for a no-holds bar wrestling match against last year's returning champions a rough and rugged bunch of voluptuous bikers. But the film did throw some "funny" fighting in there with some hilarious cat fight scenes.
