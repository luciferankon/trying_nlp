Born into an aristocratic family Hubert de Givenchy reveals losing his father at the age of two being raised along with his brother by his adoring mother during hard times. Uninterested in sports like most other boys Hubert--an exceptionally tall child for his age--developed an interest in fashion early on which was considered highly eccentric. In an intimate conversational setting Givenchy discusses his early friends and contemporaries such as Bettina and Dior as well as his early idol and foremost fashion influence designer Cristobal Balenciaga.
