Mr. Buys the Flemish teacher from "Meester hij begint weer!" takes an even more challenging teaching job - not only the new generation of pupils is even sassier in this parallel type of school (neither the subsidized market-leading Catholic nor the publicly organized net's curriculum) called Streber (a pun of the real Steiner school) pupils are formally encouraged to learn empirically and express themselves quite freely. Adding to his troubles the principal is a selfish dictatorial vamp his colleagues are cynics and the janitor a jealous busybody.
