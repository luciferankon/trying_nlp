A man falls into the Bosphorus on a snowy night. His son Mete half-heartedly searches for him in wintered Istanbul. As Mete traces through the undercurrents of his father's life he takes on the role of the father figure in his family both by heading his own search to find him and also becoming him through seemingly arbitrary forms of modern communication. Yet all of this transformation seems in vain and the personal and political problems become more visible.
