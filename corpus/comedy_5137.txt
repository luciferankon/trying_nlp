Rory is a newspaper man with one famous moment to his credit-he broke the great "Teflon" story. Commissioned by a publisher to gather together former stars and famous individuals to write their stories he ends up in the wilderness at a camp trying to sort through the riddled pasts of people who have long since moved on.
