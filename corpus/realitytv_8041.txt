Bryan directs the Secret Stash's first commercial. Three customers with rare books to sell show up: one with a box of valuable comics her garbage-collector husband found on the curb; a second with a stack of classic Fireside Books (some of the first "trade paperback" comic collections published); and the third with his grandmother's comic collection potentially worth $750000. Another young lady - a struggling artist with a wild hairdo - shows up to sell off her collector's edition Megatron figure.
