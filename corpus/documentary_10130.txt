Behind our world-famous beaches tourist attractions and sunny suburbs lies an alarming secret: Tampa Bay is a hotbed for human trafficking. Men women and children are forced against their will to serve in the sex trade domestic servitude and agricultural industries. They are bought sold and discarded in our own community making Florida the third-highest ranked state in the nation for this fast-growing crime. Join us for an in-depth look at this crisis with TOO CLOSE TO HOME a WEDU documentary on human trafficking in Tampa Bay. Local law enforcement service providers and citizens are creating a grass roots movement to help combat this form of modern-day slavery.
