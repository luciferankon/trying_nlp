The issue of diversity of gender and minorities has drawn a lot of attention in Hollywood. But there is another diversity issue that few people talk about: the inclusion of people with disabilities in film and TV. Individuals with disabilities make up 20% of the population but their representation on TV and in movies is less than 1%. Diffability Hollywood is a film that intends to address this issue and change that statistic. It is a documentary about Hollywood's portrayal of people with disabilities in films throughout history. One of filmmaker Adrian Esposito's main goals in making this film is to advocate for more inclusion of writers directors and actors with disabilities into the movie industry. He also wants the film industry to portray people with disabilities in less stereotypical ways.
