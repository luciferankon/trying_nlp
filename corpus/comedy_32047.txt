Jack Madigan is by many accounts blessed. He can still effortlessly turn a pretty head. And thanks to his legendary rock star father he lives an enviable existence in a once-glorious now-crumbling Boston town house with his teenage son Harlan. But there is one tiny drawback: Jack is an agoraphobe. As long as his dad's admittedly dwindling royalties keep rolling in Jack's condition isn't a problem. But then the money runs out... and all hell breaks loose. The bank is foreclosing. Jack's ex is threatening to take Harlan to California. And Lucinda the little girl next door won't stay out of his kitchen... or his life. To save his sanity Jack's path is clear albeit impossible-he must outwit the bank's adorably determined real estate agent win back his house keep his son at home and finally with Lucinda's help find a way back to the world outside his door.
