Overly mature Betty Blythe is cast as the gamine-like granddaughter of a Turkish rabbi who is taken out of her cozy environs by a music-hall star and transformed into a cabaret dancer. It isn't that she hates the work; it's simply that she feels she has turned her back on her people. Blythe is rescued by an elderly Jewish leader who takes her to a Zionist colony in Palestine. She marries her benefactor but her heart remains with her true love back in Constantinople.
