Gote is a young teen who seems to be at odds with his family and may not know his own mind that well either. Discontented and rebellious Gote joins up with two mean-spirited game poachers in spite of the fact that he loves animals and nature. This contradiction between his own feelings and his need to rebel reaches a climax when a forest ranger starts to track down the young men in ever-tightening circles.
