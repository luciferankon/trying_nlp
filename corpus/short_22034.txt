A jaunt with Will Rogers through "the oldest and the youngest of European nations." We start in the vale of Gelndalough. Scenic views alternate with Rogers' commentary: jokes about Al Smith Irish relatives in the U.S. and references to Home Rule and the struggle for independence. Then it's on to the estate of Richard Croker the boss at Tammany Hall buried near his favorite horse. Will chats with Croker's widow and introduces us to Mrs. Rogers. On to the lakes and dells of Killarney the ruins of Ross Castle and a pig market where we meet the Earl of Killarney. The camera pans a group of children - the future police force of the U.S. says Rogers.
