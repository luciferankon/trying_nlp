After years of trying to help his fellow Roma (Gypsy) people Safet Tairov has finally convinced a group of Germans to donate humanitarian goods and build a kindergarten. But many obstacles block Safet's progress in his small Eastern European village: the mayor won't speak to him; the non-Roma citizens are hurt that foreigners are only helping minorities; Safet's organization has little community support and no resources; dealing with Westerners is culturally challenging. Ultimately the challenges prove victorious.
