In 1925 William Faulkner lived in New Orleans for a few months writing short sketches in which he called the city to life. Inspired by Faulkner???s impressions Marjoleine Boonstra drifts through the devastated streets of New Orleans at ungodly hours looking for the fears and dreams of people whose lives have gone adrift as a result of the hurricane Katrina.
