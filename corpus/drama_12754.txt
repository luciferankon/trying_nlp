An American couple has just moved into an old house in Devon England when a very windy storm hits. During its height the front doors open revealing a young boy wearing only shorts standing in the doorway. The couple takes him in but find he won't speak and just stares off into the distance. The couple tries to get him to talk and offer him food but he continues to be non-responsive. As time passes he is strangely attracted to a shawl a rocking horse and singing only he can hear. A doctor is called but he can't come up with a full diagnosis. What brought the boy to his present state?
