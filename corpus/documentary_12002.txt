The 61st annual German Film Awards were held at the Friedrichstadtpalast in Berlin. Outstanding achievements since the last award's show were honored with the German Film Award (the statuette is named "Lola" and was firstly awarded in 1999; the award before was a golden strip handed out in a red box). The award for the best film is annualy presented to three films in Bronze in Silver and in Gold (like a ranking). Every year the German Film Academy bestowes an Honorary Award for outstanding contribution to the German film (it is an award for lifetime achivement) and each year the Academy pays tribute to deceased artists who worked in German film and have passed away since the last award's show (Memorial Tribute). The award's show is often not presented live on German television but shown time-delayed.
