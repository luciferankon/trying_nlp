Based on Gene Stratton-Porter's novel and a remake of Columbia's 1934 "The Girl of the Limberlost" and 1939's "Romance of the Limberlost" this one has altered the kinship who-hates-the-girl relationship from an aunt to her mother. This time out Elnora Comstock (Dorinda Clifton) lives on the edge of a great swamp and collects butterflies to sell in order to go to high school and pay for violin lessons. Her mother Kate Comstock (Ruth Nelson) hates her as she blames the girl for the father's death as he drowned in a quagmire on the way home the night the girl was born. The years-late revelation that the husband had been off courting a neighbor woman that night brings an attitude adjustment to the mother.
