The legend the details and the lie surrounding the Bolivian city that went to war over water. A mother who lost her son an Army General who was ordered to send troops against his own hometown a homeless man who became a hero and a single father who harvests flowers help shape the so-called triumph of the Cochabamba water war. As time passed the complexity of reality transformed this story into a tale of tragedy. In an attempt to become part of this people's movement a young filmmaker has no choice but to abandon what he believes in. What remains is an exploration of the lost relationship between man and water and ultimately the lost relationship of man with himself.
