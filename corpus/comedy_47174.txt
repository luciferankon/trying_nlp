Natalie Monroe is a 40-year-old woman who aspires to have a child before it is too late. We begin with her trip to an embryo bank to pick up her embryos and then flashback to three months prior. We meet Natalie's boyfriend as well as her fertility doctor and learn more about her life specifically that she has the same odds of winning the lottery as having a child.
