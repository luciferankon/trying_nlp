1991 was to be the last year of steam operations on the Polskie Koleje Panstwow or PKP - Polish State Railways. It brought to a close the last revenue earning steam hauled freight and passenger services in Europe. This film shows these operations from a variety of viewpoints without narration in order that you can enjoy uninterrupted the sound of steam at work.
