According to the old stories written about 300 years ago during the Lithuanian - Swedish war the bell from the bell tower of Plateliai Church has been removed and taken off. It was carried away across the frozen lake but the ice cracked near the Kastel island and the bell sank. One hundred years later a snorkeling expedition went on a search for the bell. It has been told that they found it but for inexplicable reasons they let it sink again.
