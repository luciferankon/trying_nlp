In Karaikudi Gouravam is a well-known traditional cook making a living undertaking orders for marriage functions. He is forced into taking an order for a local goon's wedding and is not happy about it. Saravanan (Vishal) and his four friends who come to work for him as junior cooks offer to help him but land him in even greater trouble and they are forced to flee from Karaikudi. The story shifts to Trichy where Saravanan and his friends have grand plans of opening a restaurant with the help of Gouravam and his money. Here just like in Malaikottai it is love at first sight for Saravanan when he sees Aishwarya.
