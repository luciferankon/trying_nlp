A New York insurance company sends in a team of high levels investigators to assess a claim related to the accidental death of six workers on an oil platform off the coast of Nigeria. As the investigation unfolds it becomes clear that the dead men were in fact taken hostage by terrorists and slaughtered. In normal circumstances the huge claim would just be refused. But these aren't normal circumstances; the insurance company has walked into a political and economic minefield. Denial would place them at odds with Nigeria and the rest of Africa. Multi-national companies working in the region would be severely punished. There could only be one solution: pay up. Keep silent and pretend. The chief investigator is left hopelessly compromised.
