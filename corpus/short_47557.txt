We watch the filmmaker's mother Barbra Padgett go through her daily life in a Long Island suburb: rising checking a busy schedule visiting middle schools and high schools to talk about AIDS taking her pills lifting weights hugging her family. We hear the voices of seven children reading letters written to her after visits to their schools. The child's letter ends with "Your admirer."
