3 men. 3 demons. 1 set of values. Family Values takes you into the lives of the Hill family. One year ago Ares Hill and his older brother Th√©oden "Theo" Hill were made orphans when their mother died. To prevent them from becoming wards of the state their cousin Achilles agrees to move in and take on the role of guardian. The only problem is Achilles isn't necessarily equipped to handle the issues that the Hill brothers are facing and in many ways they actually parent and protect him from his own crises - a responsibility the Hill brothers often resent especially Ares. Violent streaks addiction and doubts of self-identity dwell within as they each try to move on from their losses and find their place in the world. Throughout all the chaos of the Hill family one thing remains true...what happens in the Hill house stays in the Hill house. See what happens as 3 young men grow into true manhood finding their footing...and their Family Values.
