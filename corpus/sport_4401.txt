Join the Discovery team and get an inside look at how Lance Armstrong prepares for his final tour de France. Five months before the race in a multi-million dollar aerospace wind tunnel watch how top engineers perfect his gear clothing and equipment with high-tech energy saving techniques. Then travel to France for the grueling twenty-stage race and follow Lance and his team through the French Alps and country-side to his final ride down Champ Elysees. You'll get a first-hand look at the team's "weapons factory" in Belgium what the riders eat during the tour and what it takes to become the top athlete in the World's Greatest Race.
