The intention to create 'Sankari' was to showcase the feelings that suffer those who face daily homophobia and intolerance that destroy the progress of our current world society. Not without implying that regardless of the gender that characterizes us we have the right to love how and with whom we please freely. It is based on the meaning of the word Sankari which means Hero in Finnish. Giving an understanding of the act of rebellion when there are feelings of love towards another person and the salvation of endowing sexual freedom with anyone.
