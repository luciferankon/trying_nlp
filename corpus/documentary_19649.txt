The Vikings changed Europe forever yet half of them have almost completely disappeared from collective memory: the women. Quite unjustly so as they played an important role in the world of the Vikings and performed extraordinary deeds. Viking women commanded ships and settled colonies. They took up arms and negotiated with emperors. Their traces can now be proven all the way from America to Kiev. Without their biographies the period of the Vikings stays incomplete. The two-part documentary "VIKING WOMEN" gives completely new insights into a fascinating culture about which it seemed everything was already known. Exclusive interviews with experts from around the globe draw an authentic picture of the Viking world according to the latest scientific findings. High quality recreations with an international top-class cast will lead us to the early medieval world of the Vikings and revive this fascinating long-lost era. Based on characters of the Nordic sagas the mini-series displays the life stories of two Viking women: those of Sigrun and Jova.
