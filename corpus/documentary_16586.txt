Lastrick is a band from Madrid (Spain) started by four friends that in the winter of 1994 decided to start playing the music they liked. What in the beginning started as a way of killing time was turning into an important part of their lives to the point that today and almost without realizing they've been playing for more than fifteen years always with the same lineup. In this DVD we can see twelve of these years with much to tell and much to show that have allowed them to live many experiences some of them good and others not so good. Among the best ones the trips they've made the people they've met the good fun on and around the stage and over all the simple fact of going on with this the same ones that started it but older and according to a few playing better. The bad experiences? We'll leave those for another day. Growing older they look back and see how the majority of the bands that were working when they started don't exist today. They remain here playing punk-rock and trust that they'll continue for much longer.
