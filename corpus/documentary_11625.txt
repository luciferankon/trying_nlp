In this allegorical documentary we exercise a search for answers to life's unpronounced questions in the labyrinth of a medieval medina. The milestones of the quest are existential scientific religious and artistic expressions. Here colors sounds figures and authentic musical threads lead the wanderer. The verbal as well as the visual and sonic guidance concerns eternal truth-seeking fear foreignness the sacredness of life the discovery of "otherness" the loss of the garden of Eden inside and outside work and worship ecstasy and pacification.
