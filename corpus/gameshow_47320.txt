A short-lived revival of the old Merv Griffen quiz show. Similar to most other quiz shows except for one twist: the host gave the answers to which the contestants would then have to supply the questions. The show would become more successful in its later incarnation with host Alex Trebek. Short-lived revival of the classic Merv Griffin-produced game show where contestants must supply the questions to answers. Three contestants one a returning champion competed. While the basic rules were identical to the 1964-1975 version (i.e. answer in the form of a question dollar values to questions added or subtracted as appropriate daily doubles etc.) there were a number of rule changes adopted for this version. Most notably the lowest-scoring contestant after the Jeopardy! round was eliminated from further play while only the top-scoring contestant at the end of the Double Jeopardy! round got to compete in an entirely new endgame called Super Jeopardy! In Super Jeopardy! the contestant had to provide the correct questions to five answers either horizontally vertically or diagonally; up to three incorrect questions were allowed. Getting five correct questions won a $5000 bonus (plus $2500 for each show the endgame was not won); a third incorrect question stopped Super Jeopardy! (all previous winnings for that show were considered safe). Contestants continued until winning five games or defeated.
