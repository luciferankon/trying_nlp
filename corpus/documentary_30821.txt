Although it can be difficult to detect the influences in the work of Leonard Cohen he was informed by a far-reaching list of musicians writers poets and philosophies. In Leonard Cohen's Lonesome Heroes the scope and detail of his artistic inspirations are put under the microscope. Cohen's first love was poetry and in the works of fellow Canadian Irving Layton and the Spanish bard Federico Garcia Lorca he found the words that moved him to create his own verse. The beat writers too hit a positive note and their work has lived with him throughout his career. While it may come as no surprise to find Bob Dylan and Judy Collins included in this film a less acknowledged genre of interest to Leonard is country music he was deeply affected by performers such as Hank Williams and Hank Snow. Religion and spirituality too have contributed enormously to Leonard's life and music particularly the faith into which he was born Judaism and his more recent study of Buddhism.
