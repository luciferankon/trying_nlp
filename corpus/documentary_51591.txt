KILLING ED is an exposé about the corruption politics and anti-democratic efforts to privatize U.S. public schools. The documentary investigates the worst case scenario: a rapidly expanding taxpayer-funded Texas-based charter school network - America's largest - operated by a global Islamic organization known as the Gülen Movement.
