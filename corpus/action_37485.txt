In the near future when the creator of planet earth has had enough. Fed up with man's constant failure in becoming a peaceful race he sets into motion a series of events that will test man's true nature. To that end Jesus himself is dispatched to avert the Apocalypse as the Creator's actions have triggered an unintended effect: the release of Satan and his entire demon army upon the unsuspecting human race. Now the stage is set for a galactic confrontation of good versus evil in a fight to the death. More importantly Jesus must decide if now is the time for him to leave his vow of peace and love and enter the war as a full fledged soldier for God. In this case turning the other cheek is not an option. The Demons are rising. Somebody's gotta' take 'em down.
