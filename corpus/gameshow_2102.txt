Host Frank Nicotero invites partiers aboard a boat to win money by answering trivia questions. Contestants compete as teams of two or three and must answer three questions correctly to win $500. They are allowed one free wrong answer but if they get a second question wrong they must undergo a punishment such as eating worms having an eyebrow shaved off or being zapped with a stun gun in order to continue in the game. Teams who win $500 then have the option to double their winnings by choosing from two coolers one of which contains $1000.
