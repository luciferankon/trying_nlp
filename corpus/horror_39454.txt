From independent filmmaker Jay Byrne comes an old fashioned horror anthology filled with plenty of shocking surprises. In "The Abduction of Jordan" a young man tells 3 crazy stories to his kidnappers in order to stay alive. In "The House on King Road" a woman discovers the terrifying truth that lurks within her own home. In "The Request" an unfortunate individual summons a demon to help solve his problems. Finally in "The Sitter" a mother leaves her child with a woman who has much more disturbing things on her mind. So get some popcorn kick back and just remember: This does happen in your...HOMETOWN.
