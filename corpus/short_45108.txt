In July of 2016 Catholic Youth from around the world descended on Krakow Poland for World Youth Day with Pope Francis. These pilgrims travelled in the footsteps of St. John Paul II and other great Saints of Krakow discovering the rich heritage of their Catholic faith and being inspired by Pope Francis' chosen theme "Blessed are the Merciful for they shall receive Mercy."
