Martine a housewife who lives alone with her son Silvio a student in political sciences whom she still supports financially goes through serious money problems. Far from being deterred she decides to bounce back. With this in mind she buys an old truck and transforms it into an itinerant hair salon which will serve (it is her choice) a poor neighborhood. Martine endures a difficult start but little by little people all more or less colorful come to the salon and become not only customers but true friends as well . But there are also the 'unhappy few' who resent the 'intruder'.
