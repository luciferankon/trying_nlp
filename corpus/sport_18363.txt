For some embracing the mountains is not just part of life-it's a way of life. The search for snow shapes not only how they approach these peaks but also how they approach the world. And whether athletes spend their days dropping first descents in Alaska lapping the local mountain or training for the Olympics they're part of a community built around a shared passion. The bonds that form from this community transcend continents and cultures transforming strangers into friends. After all a smile on a powder day needs no translation.
