His colorful art and cross-border life is captivating but not always easy to understand. "It's for me a must to make pictures an internal compulsion so no one can decide for yourself" says Ian.

Ian's relationship with the family school and the rest of society was complicated and he slowly began to build up his own world where he could survive better.
