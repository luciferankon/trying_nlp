In the vast emptiness of the Pacific Ocean tectonic movements construct or swallow islands. In the Tongan archipelago two little-known animals have learned to cope with these ephemeral lands risen from the ocean depths: the sooty tern a seabird that never dares wet its wings for fear of drowning and the Alvin shrimp a blind crustacean that manages to find its way around the abyss. When an underwater volcano becomes an island the fates of these two extraordinary paradoxes are linked.
