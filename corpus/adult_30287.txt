Tighttwat Institute for Sexual Research aka "Hard-on Heaven" is where Dr. Cherrypopper gets sex readings from assistant Miss Motormouth. Their new client is impotent Harry Flattout. As a workplace sex pacifier Harry pacified Ginny Pullertit and shy new worker Mary-Ann Lobglob with assistance from Thunderfart who moved on to passer-by Captain Sukatiddy. Harry got fired ganging up on Mr. Cockpul's private secretary and lover Elaine Ziptitz. Dr. Tighttwat takes her own advantage of Harry supposedly ascertaining his case while really climaxing while remaining a virgin. Up next Dr. Cherrypopper's machine overloads when his assistant seduces him and the assistant test drives Harry's resulting permanent erection. Harry uses it to forcefully deflower Dr. Tighttwat until she consents. So does Elaine Ziptitz who reveals ending up enjoying their first encounter. Harry is re-hired as the boss realizes the importance of fringe benefits.
