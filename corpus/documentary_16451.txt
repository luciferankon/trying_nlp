In the context of Mixer the ERT-3 TV series my journalist friend and collaborator Pavlos Nerantzis and I decided to investigate the Carlo Giuliani case. He was the young Italian demonstrator who was murdered during the demonstrations against globalization in Genoa in 2001. Our intention was to get to know the first victim of police violence that shaped the subsequent course of the anti-globalization movement. Through the narrations of his parents and sister we relive the violence of those days and we bring his character to light. The tragic events in Genoa during the G8 summit conference were sealed by the death of young demonstrator Carlo Giuliani. One year later the Public Prosecutor has not ruled yet whether the case will be filed or whether the policeman who shot Carlo will be put on trial. One year later the documentary returns to Genoa and meets Carlo's parents who speak about their son's personality. Through their narration we follow the events of these three days and the investigation that followed on the precise conditions of their son's death. Mainly however we get a chance to reexamine police violence and the Berlusconi phenomenon which collides with the institutions and the Italian center-left political forces. Along with Carlo's father the documentary visits the setting of the tragedy and goes on to attend the congress of the bigger confederation of trade unions in Italy and the workers' mobilization against the Berlusconi government in Rome.
