When he decides to live on his own his father gives him a boat which Paukam loves all through his life and is the primary source of income. His livelihood is picking firewood from Brahmaputra river and selling it to wood merchant which is used for cooking purposes. He raises a family of 3 kids and supports them well beyond his means only to be betrayed in old age by all of them in some way or another. His pride and self belief takes the biggest jolt when his prized possession - the boat also is lost.
