Allumette tells the story of a young orphan girl who lives in a fantastical city in the clouds. After enduring tragedy she grasps at hope for her future. Loosely inspired by "The Little Match Girl" by Hans Christian Andersen Allumette is an account of the love a mother and daughter have for one another and the sacrifices they make for the greater good.
