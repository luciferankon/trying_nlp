Luis an ordinary individual in Spain caught up in that country's economic crisis a crisis that began in the United States. As we watch him struggle with unemployment and the threat of foreclosure we are reminded of the 4 million long-term unemployed in the U.S. the growing gap between rich and poor and the millions of foreclosures that have occurred since 2008. Luis does all the right things: goes to an unemployment office checks out the employment listings posted by private firms checks the newspaper listings asks friends for a job accepts whatever part-time work is offered to him...and goes to the bank to apply for a loan. A set of domino players makes it clear in casual conversation that Luis' plight is simply a microcosm of what is happening in the entire country. Underlining this theme we join Luis in watching a demonstration observe a man hired by a bank as he arranges for the removal of furniture from a home the bank has foreclosed on and hear two bankers in conversation discussing a disastrous investment that has collapsed. We also see Luis' family which doesn't realize that he (and they) are on the brink of disaster plan for the wedding of his eldest son a wedding which Luis frankly is not going to be able to pay for. And we ask ourselves is there any way Luis will be able to save the situation? Luis a middle-aged family man caught up in the economic crisis as are millions of Spaniards today. As we watch to see if he will find a way out of his serious problems we are reminded of the 4 million long-term unemployed in the USA the growing gap between rich and poor and the threat that continuing instability at the national level puts us in.
