Two stories of beautiful women in peril. In the first a supermodel travels to a third world country to obtain the release of some abducted Westerners when she is grabbed by the rebel leader holding her friends captive. In the second story a buxom blonde daydreams of herself being placed in bondage peril by all sorts of villains.
