While the collapse of the Western Roman Empire led to a great loss of sacred knowledge in Europe the fires of Alchemy kept burning in the east. Many Greek texts were translated into Arabic and these inspired Islamic thinkers to further investigate the subject of Alchemy. In time their writings filtered back to the west where they inspired an amazing poetic genre often illustrated with the most extraordinary pictures. In this program we examine this legacy going beyond Hermes' Emerald Tablet examining how this movement obscured simple truths. Featuring renowned author and researcher Adrian Gilbert in this ongoing series of Occult and Esoteric Knowledge.
