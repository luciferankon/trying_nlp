Never-before seen video footage of a family visit to the World Trade Center observation deck as so many thousands of tourists did until 9-10-01 the day before the 9-11 attacks. The filmmaker held this footage for 10 years until finally presenting it here juxtaposed with the actual FDNY dispatch calls of 9-11 to show how the world changed so dramatically between 9-10 and 9-11.
