Crossing Rome takes us back into the intriguing and inspiring first centuries of the Christian faith and the experience of the Early Church at Rome. The documentary uncovers many fascinating historical and archaeological finds that show how the cross at Rome went from being a symbol of criminality and shame to a sign of triumph and loving sacrifice. From the crucifixion to the coliseum to the catacombs Crossing Rome takes us gently but unavoidably to what it means today to "take up our cross and follow Him." This is an outstanding program for Lent and Easter. Hosted by journalist and broadcaster Paul Heiney the journey is beautifully augmented by reflections and music from students at the English College in Rome.
