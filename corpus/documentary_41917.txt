1297 French Sailors died at Mers el Kebir in July 1940 when the Royal Navy attacked and destroyed the French Fleet as it lay at its moorings. 2 weeks before the French and British had been allies in the war against Germany. Long forgotten by both French and British governments but not by the veterans and their families whose lives changed tragically forever.
