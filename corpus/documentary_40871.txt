Most cops patrol the streets in a regular squad car but for some keeping the peace requires a rather different beast. Street Racing: Zero Tolerance follows the high-octane home of a seriously high-stakes street racing where you're more likely to find the police force in a modified Dodge Challenger than a Black Maria. With illegal night-time races on the streets of this town reaching speeds of over 120mph an elite task force of law enforcement officers is used to stop the would-be Lewis Hamiltons in their tracks -- whatever it takes. It's the ultimate game of cat and mouse where one false turn could lead to tragedy.
