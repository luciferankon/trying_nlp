Sharing a title with the award-winning play of the same name I Am Rohingya chronicles the journey of fourteen refugee youth who take the stage in order to depict their families' harrowing experiences during the on-going Burmese genocide of Rohingya Muslims. Leading up to the opening night of their performance the film takes audiences through the personal lives of the child performers capturing their struggles as they adjust to their new lives in Canada and exploring the difficult rehearsal process of recreating scenes of horror. With no prior acting experience these youth must come together and re-enact the stories of their people in order to show the world that they will not be forgotten.
