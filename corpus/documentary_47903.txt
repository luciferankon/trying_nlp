During the 1940s the state of Sonora was greatly aided trough great hydraulic works in the area of irrigation as well as the establishment of programs such as ''the Green Revolution'' and allocation of land programs in the Yaqui and Mayo valleys. In the long run it suffered the effects of the various economic crises that began in the 1970s which also affected livestock raising and mining. This period's major issues are centered on phenomena such as migration and the establishment of border-area maquiladoras which began transforming the state's production profile beginning in the seventies. The end of this era would be marked by the death of Sonora's Luis Donaldo Colosio in 1994.
