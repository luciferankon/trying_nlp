Former diplomat Yeb Sańo and the climate pilgrims take a journey through Europe crossing three countries and arrive in Paris for the international climate talks. The multi-faith pilgrimage embodies a spirit of diversity and unity and along the way they are helped by communities who share their vision of peace. In a tense political environment following the November attacks in Paris the pilgrims unite with others to express their frustrations at weak government action and dare to hope for a brighter future. Tayo Tayo is a film about Yeb Sańo and the climate pilgrims and their journey across Europe. Embodying diversity and religious tolerance the pilgrims come face to face with some of the greatest political moral and spiritual challenges of our times.
