Mayor Jim Blaine sends for Pecos a notorious two-gun killer to run Brad Foster and his henchmen out of Gunsight after Brad lowers the "cut" he gives the mayor from his gambling place. On the way to Gunsight Pecos encounters Johnny Macklin and is accidentally killed in a fight after he tries to steal Johnny's horse Rebel. On the road Johnny picks up 12-year-old Bud Hartley brother of rancher Judy Hartley. When Johnny arrives in town the mayor mistakes him for Pecos and makes him the sheriff after Brad's men unsuccessfully try to kill him and Reno an old-time prospector and friend of the Hartleys. Judy refuses to speak to Johnny because he is working for the mayor whom she claims is as crooked as Foster. The latter Drago and other henchmen attempt to kill Johnny for closing the gambling casino but their plan backfires and several of them are jailed. Drago is killed by Johnny in a gun fight and Foster is arrested. Johnny also orders the mayor out of town. Foster breaks out of jail and a trap is laid for Johnny but he learns of it and rounds up the whole gang. Judy persuades Johnny to remain in Gunsight instead of heading for the road again.
