I chose to do my film on my personal struggle with the deadly addiction bulimia. My intent throughout the film was to shed light on a disorder that is rarely spoken about or portrayed correctly in the public eye. One in three high school girls are diagnosed with bulimia. Why don't we hear more about it? I chose to graphically display my addiction on screen in hopes of shedding some light on a dangerous and deadly addiction that runs rampant amongst teenage girls today.
