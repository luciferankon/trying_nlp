Stealing Klimt recounts the struggle by 90-year-old Maria Altmann to recover five Gustav Klimt paintings stolen from her family by the Nazis in Vienna. From the end of the War up until last year these paintings hung in the Austrian National Gallery. The film covers Maria's early life in glittering fin-de-siƒçcle Vienna her dramatic escape from Nazi terror and her courageous fight to recover the five Klimt's against all the odds. Maria's fight to reclaim the paintings eventually took her to the United States Supreme Court and pitted her not just against Austria but also against the US Government which asked the Supreme Court to reject her case. After Maria finally emerged victorious in 2006 one of the paintings - the "Golden Portrait" of Maria's aunt Adele Bloch Bauer - was sold to cosmetics tycoon Ronald Lauder for $135m becoming the world's most expensive painting ever sold. The other four paintings were recently auctioned at Christie's for record prices.
