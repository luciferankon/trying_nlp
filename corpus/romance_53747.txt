Mexico miner Pete Carroll is in Acapulco and meets Terry Perreau and falls in love with her after he hears her singing (or dubbed) on a recording of "Extrano Amour (Strange Love.) The troubled Terry decides she wants to go shark fishing so Pete poses as the skipper of a fishing boat owned by Thursday and off they go. Pete lands a mantray and cuts it up for bait and the sharks are soon swarming and Terry dives in the water. Terry does likewise and fights a few sharks and gets his leg gaashed but finally rescues her. Gradually her friendship also turns into love. But back in Acapulco she learns of Pete's "fake skipper" joke is all hacked off and goes to Mexico City with her friend Dr. Antez. There a specialist Dr. Rivas tells her that unless she has a dangerous operation she has only three months to live. Depressed even more than usual if possible she returns to the hotel and is met by!
