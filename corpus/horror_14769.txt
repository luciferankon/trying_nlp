Eternal Kiss tells the story of David Manners a thirty-something filmmaker from the small seaside town of Harker's Cove who gets more than he bargained for when he sets out to make a documentary about people who believe in the existence of vampires... and finds himself the target of media mogul Elisabeth Langstrom a very real vampire who is convinced that David is her soul-mate. But nothing is as simple as it seems in a film that has more twists and turns than a mountain road - David has secrets of his own including a tortured past that even he doesn't fully remember or understand and a burgeoning love affair with Laura Watson the new girl in town who may also be more than she seems. Also in the mix are vampire hunters - Dr. Simon Polidori and his daughter Miranda who have an agenda of their own which involves using David as bait for Langstrom. Meanwhile David's best friend and business partner Oliver Seward thinks that David is going a bit nuts but he remains steadfast even when called upon to help combat a creature that he doesn't really believe exists. Finally there are Langstrom's victims - Emily Parker a girl David meets at a bar in Toronto... Amanda Doyle the deputy mayor of Harker's Cove... and Stephanie Fielding a young lawyer who specializes in "real estate" exclusively for one client. All of them are just pawns in her game as she maneuvers everyone towards a final showdown which was prophesied centuries before. In the end however it all comes down to a choice for David - destiny or free will - and the question of whether true love can really conquer all!
