Compulsive Love is an ode to romantic love and bat-shit craziness. It follows Aaron a hopeless romantic who finds himself in increasingly insane situations as he falls in love with a new girl every episode. But the worse things get the more determined Aaron is to push through to the pinnacle of transcendent love he knows is out there somewhere. Preferably with someone really hot.
