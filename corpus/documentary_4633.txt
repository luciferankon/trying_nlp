This film provides a broad overview of !Kung life both past and present and an intimate portrait of N!ai a !Kung woman who in 1978 was in her mid-thirties. N!ai tells her own story and in so doing the story of changes in !Kung life over a thirty year period. "Before the white people came we did what we wanted" N!ai recalls describing the life she remembers as a child: following her mother to pick berries roots and nuts as the season changed; the division of giraffe meat; the kinds of rain; her resistance to her marriage to /Gunda at the age of eight; and her changing feelings about her husband when he becomes a healer. As N!ai speaks the film presents scenes from the 1950's that show her as a young girl and a young wife. The uniqueness of N!ai may lie in its tight integration of ethnography and history. While it portrays the changes in !Kung society over thirty years it never loses sight of the individual N!ai.
