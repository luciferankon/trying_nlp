The three witches from "Macbeth" are brewing a potion - well two of them are; the Third Witch is reading The Complete Works of Shakespeare. When Puck drops by and the Third Witch's book ends up in the cauldron all stories from Shakespeare are mixed up. Juliet's declaration of love transforms into a war speech; Mrs Egeus and Lady Capulet exchange anecdotes about their daughters' disobedience; Hamlet meets Lady Macbeth in the castle grounds; and Claudius King of Denmark and Romeo seek out Oberon to buy poison. In the meantime Puck and the Third Witch try to retrieve the lost pages and put them in the right order again - before it is too late.
