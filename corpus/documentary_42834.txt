This documentary shows the early ideas about how nuclear war between the USA and the USSR could look like. It is made purely from the US side and takes place mostly in the US military command and control bunkers. The movie tries to be serious however it is overly optimistic about the USAF chances to win the nuclear war. (But remember it was made before the nuclear missiles became the main delivery method for the nuclear warheads.)
