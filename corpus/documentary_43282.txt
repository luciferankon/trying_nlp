Coverdale: A Year in the Life records the people places events and the changing seasons in this beautiful part of the Yorkshire Dales between December 2014 and December 2015. Featuring the traditional farms and modern businesses of the dale as well as almost unique events such as Foresters' Day the film explores life in a twenty-first century community which although rooted in rural history has also changed with the times.
