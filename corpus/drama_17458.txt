Three vignettes "The Domino Players" "The Secret Miracle" and "point of View" are linked by telephone conversations being surreptitiously listened to by Marcos the main character. Navigating the fine line between comedy and tragedy "107 Street" not only richly illustrates the particulars of ethnic life in one pulsating New York City neighborhood it explores that world's universality. Premiered at the 2004 New York International Latino Film Festival.
