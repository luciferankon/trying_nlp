TOMFL - Test of Movement as a Foreign Language serves as an alert mechanism which subverting the schemes of identification with the characters forces the advance to a level of creation of new senses. However invention is not the final goal: the irony of the film's formulation as a "test" diverts the spectator from the exercise of the creation of meaning and induces him on the contrary to an action of discovery. It is precisely through this path that the reflection about movement and the possibilities of its cinematic translation completes itself.
