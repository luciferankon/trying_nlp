EPISODE ONE: This episode deals with crazy women who are jealous and insecure and how these issues can sabotage a relationship. Andre (Zack Banks) is a hard working guy who was just promoted at work. Dana (Bridgette Edwards) his girlfriend is going through an 'irrational jealous phase' and decides to set out to 'prove' once and for all that Andre is a no good cheating bastard just like her last boyfriend. Andre must deal not only with Dana but his co-worker Stacey (Dominique Williams) who threatens to deal with the situation in her own way. Andre must also learn that 'going with your gut' isn't always the best plan. In the end we must decide whether Dana and his relationship can be saved; or whether Dana is really as crazy as she seems.
