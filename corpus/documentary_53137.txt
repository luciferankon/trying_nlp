In 1987 the Singapore government using the Internal Security Act arrested 22 people in what was called "Operation Spectrum". These people were held indefinitely without trial physically and mentally tortured and coerced into admitting that they were guilty of a "Marxist conspiracy" on public television. In this film ex-detainees share what they experienced during that time.
