La Esperanza focuses on the lives of two teenage girls Marivela and Esperanza coming of age in San Diego in the sometimes frightening generally hysterical and consistently difficult neighborhood and world of Barrio Logan. Both girls dream of going away to college but as their future unfolds during senior year each is faced with tough circumstances and mounting responsibilities that threaten their dreams. Esperanza struggles as a teenage mom. Marivela's family faces the looming threat of gentrification displacement due to lack of affordable housing in the neighborhood she calls home. As the story progresses we see first-hand the challenges presented to many young people today as they attempt to maneuver a world not seemingly designed for their success.
