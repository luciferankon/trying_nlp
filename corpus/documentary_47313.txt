The performance artist Michael Richardt and his mother Malou are very close. But major unanswered questions lurk beneath the surface and Michael's expressive flamboyant exterior conceals a hardcore family story about social inheritance. So in the quest to understand his origins Michael invites his mother to join him on a road trip to visit some of the key places from their past. What lies ahead is a documentary adventure packed with surprises and random but oddly meaningful encounters with old friends and sympathetic strangers all of who give both mother and son something they were missing. Cecilie Debell has created a moving funny almost disarmingly vibrant family story in which imagination is the key word. A cinematic epistle about tolerance in an age that sorely needs it.
