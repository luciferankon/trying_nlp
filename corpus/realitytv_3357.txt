Astro Tires Tycoon and Custom Cycles Guru Brent Barry share location customers and mutual dislike. Other show regulars include Mary Lher Eddie's spendthrift girlfriend Ted Way the resident redneck and two wacky Latin tire-changers. The show represents "Hot Chicks Hot Bikes and Hot Cars" with a large dose of automotive/cycling expertise. Couple that with the RAW behavior of Eddie and Brent and you have non-stop combustion.
