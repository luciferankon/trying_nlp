In 2006 my father suffered a stroke at the age of forty-three. Although he was not diagnosed to recover today he is healthy but retains moderate short-term memory loss. Our memories are at a crossroads in which he remembers what I cannot from the beginning of my life but I can remember most of what he cannot in his daily life now. These conflicting experiences compete with standardized medical facts and my own personal recollections of a stroke event. In degrading images from my childhood that I experienced but cannot remember I reconcile the fact that my father can still remember them despite trouble recalling many of his own today. This film explores the impulse to gain control over an uncontrollable event and how images decay as much as memories.
