Six friends are camping far away from civilization. They want to forget to dream and have a good time. They discuss conformism and culture politics violence and the human condition seeking answers to eternal questions: what are we what is our fate as individuals and as part of a larger entity? Each of them carries his own 'pillow'. How much do we have to live behind us to really be away? Who do we take with us? What do we take with us?
