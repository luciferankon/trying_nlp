A couple of musicians are on their way to a show at a country bar. Along the way they pick up a couple of sexy hitchhiking ladies and decide to pull over for a pitstop. Eventually they make it to the bar and uncover that the deep voiced country singer that also plays there is also a pimp who uses the "waitresses" to make him some extra cash. It is up to our musician heroes to put an end to the singer and his operation. Penniless and in pressing need of a gig friends and struggling musicians Dave and Billy B while on their way to Tampa Bar a honky-tonk country music joint will come across two damsels in distress Sue and Janet who seem to be stuck in the middle of the desert. Apparently the girls' car has irreparably broken down and since they have nowhere else to go without a second thought they will accept the boys' offer to give them a ride and watch the show. However Sue and Janet haven't been exactly frank with Dave and Billy B hiding the fact that not only do they work tonight at the same bar but Maik Tampa Bar's sleazy owner and lead singer of the club's resident band has got something else going on aside from the bar and all of his girls serve much more than liquor. Eventually Sue and Janet who want out infatuated with the boys will attempt to escape but first they'll have to get past Maik who's not exactly ready to give up without a fight..
