Lying on the coast of Cape Town - South Africa's most segregated city - there is one public space where everyone does seem to come together: the Sea Point Promenade and Municipal Pools. Set between city and ocean this beautiful strip of "everymansland" offers a quirky and often entertaining mix of class race gender and religion: a place where South Africans of all backgrounds can experience happiness together... But is all as it appears? SEA POINT DAYS presents an unusual and impressionistic record of life at Cape Town's Sea Point Promenade and municipal pools using largely cinematic vignettes to explore issues of belonging integration nostalgia happiness and identity in an ex-white South African neighbourhood.
