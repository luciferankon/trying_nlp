In the first scene we see the prospectors in their camp and then watch them as they start out for the mines where they toil all day in search of the precious metal. In the evening they return to the camp and divide the day's finding. They sleep out in the open with but one man acting as sentinel keeping watch over the outfit and ready to spread the alarm in the event of an attack by the Indians. The savages who are constantly on the lookout for an opportunity to attack the white men survey the country from their hiding place in the mountains where from the tall peaks they are able to see everything that goes on in the camp below. In the calm of night they quietly steal down on the prospectors taking the sentinel unawares put him to death. They then gather up everything of value and hasten away to their hiding place in the mountains. Some scouts on the outpost follow the red men and on discovering their hiding place return to the camp and give the alarm. Immediately the prospectors are up in arms and start on the trail of the enemy. The white men after a long chase come upon the Indian camp and as the savages come dashing up the prospectors who are lying in ambush use their skill as marksmen to good advantage and all the red men with bullets. The chief who is the last one to pass by is killed by the little son of the dead sentinel.
