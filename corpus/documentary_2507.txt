We sail through the seas of absence and remembrance to tell the stories of Emilia and Yey√© two of the 49 children who died at the ABC Daycare in a fire that could have been avoided and that showed the terrible consequences of corruption and influence peddling within the system of government subrogated day-care system in Mexico. The Naptime is a visual elegy to the memory of those children and a tribute to the courageous battle of their families to hold on to life.
