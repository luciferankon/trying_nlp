STYX is a story about senne. A twenty-something wandering in the city in gloomy loneliness after a breakup. As an attempt to fight his inner demons or at least laugh a bit he follows an older friend (50) the philosophical and excentric Rockabilly Rebel Tony. Together they go to a rockabilly concert. What follows is a true bacchanal: a night filled with alcohol drugs rock 'n roll and philosophical discussions on strange moments. Suddenly the threat of violence isn't imaginary anymore. On the contrary the night reaches an absurd peak when the duo takes a drugdealer as a hostage.
