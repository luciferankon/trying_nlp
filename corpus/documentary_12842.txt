For 80 unremitting years the Institute fostered a multilateral Armenian and International education. However the executor of the Melkonian will the Central Board of the AGBU decided to terminate the Institute's mission in 2005. This act upraised a wave of dismay and sadness among Armenians. "Temple of Light" was filmed within the environs of the institute. Through its gloomy present the film attempts to commemorate the glorious past and the undeniable reputation of MEI. "Temple of Light" makes one ponder about the role and fate of the Armenian schools and institutions in Diaspora.
