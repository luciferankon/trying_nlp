A comedy about Hollywood's working actors... the ones no one in your household has heard of! Rivaling actresses Robin Hadley and Cassidy Cutlaw would never let anything except a lead role in a straight-to- "C" film get between them. Starring Who? follows a behind the scenes look into these seldom- celebrated careers led by their trusted talent agent (who moonlights as an astrologist and multi-marketing distributor for everything from Amway to Mark Kay) Meredith Jaxson.
