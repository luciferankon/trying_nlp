In the middle of the three year Dominion war (2373-2375) Federation Starfleet has lost contact with the USS Orion starship near enemy Cardassian territory; the ship had been outfitted with a prototype top secret quantum-phasing cloaking device. Fearing the technology will fall into the hands of the enemy Captain Janice Willcocks and the Federation's USS Angeles starship is tasked to undertake the search and recovery mission. Arriving at the last known location Captain Willcocks can only find some floating cargo debris along with the floating dead and stabbed body of the USS Orion's former Captain John Knapp. The USS Angeles' sensors however detect an ion trail from warp engines heading off across the Cardassian border. Admiral Max Cervantes from Star Fleet command says that an incursion into Cardassian territory would be too risky. Should Captain Willcocks follow orders and return home or follow the ion trail and attempt to rescue the crew of the USS Orion on the off-chance they might still be alive?
