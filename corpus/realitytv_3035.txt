There is a fortune buried deep in the ancient forests surrounding the small town of Falls City Oregon...but only a few men know how to find it. For 10 weeks every year they are on the hunt for one of the most expensive foods in the world a delicacy that the Roman emperor Nero dubbed the "Food of the Gods:" black truffles. For the foragers of Oregon truffles are more valuable than gold. For the first time ever we've gained exclusive access to a secret underworld of foragers and backwoods entrepreneurs. This season an historic drought ravages Oregon choking off the usually abundant wild black truffle crop and winter arrives early. With the truffle supply at an all time low the price is predicted to hit an all time high. With increased competition between the foragers and even more diggers seeking riches the truffle men of Oregon will be pushed to their limits to survive.
