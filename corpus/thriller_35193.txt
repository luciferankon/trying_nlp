Local market cashier JORDAN HARGROVE (Amanda Kaschak) is instantly shocked when AJ SUNDER (Markus Redmond) a well-known TV star buys a bottle of whiskey and tells her that he will down the bottle and then kill himself. Jordan and her best friend LORI SAMPSON (Jessica Morris) track AJ down at his home to stop him. On the way they run into SAM RANDALL (James Thomas Gilbert) a neighbor of AJ's who seems hell-bent on keeping Jordan and Lori away from AJ. When the girls prove to be unstoppable Sam joins them in confronting AJ. Soon Jordan and Lori discover an enormous amount of bad blood between the two men. Most of which seems to come from their conflicting accounts of Sam's "friendship" with AJ's recently estranged wife DREA SUNDER (Fadik Sevin Atasoy) and the mystery behind the disappearance of KEVIN REYNOLDS (Jeffrey Johnson) a man who is connected to all of the players... Kevin is Drea's ex and the father of her child and by association AJ's nemesis for the affection of Drea. Kevin is also connected to Sam through Drea potentially standing in the way of Sam's desire to have Drea for himself. That is provided Sam can lure her away from AJ permanently. Kevin also shares a secret with Jordan unbeknownst to the others including Lori... but Lori may have the most devastating secret about Kevin of all.
