The actress is on her way to visit the Prince in his castle when she is stranded on a lonely road by an accident to her motor car. The Hillman happens along and takes her to Peak Hall. He is still young and handsome but marked by the stern fanatical belief of his family that no member of it ever should leave the hills. In an exchange of confidence the Hillman warns the actress not to visit the dissolute Prince and she in turn tells him that for once he should try the broader life of the cities. Both heed the other's advice. She returns to the city and he in a brief period follows. The Prince still pursuing the actress seeks to entangle the Hillman by throwing a notorious dancer in his path but fails. Strangeway the Hillman proposes to Louise the actress but she withholds her answer. His brother comes from the hills to reclaim him but his mission is vain. Again the Hillman proposes to Louise who is always in the company of the Prince and this time is accepted. Angered at his apparent loss of the actress the Prince makes a scandalous remark about her at his club which is resented with blows by the Hillman whose love is all but crushed when hurrying to Louise she admits what the Prince said is true. The Hillman returns to Peak Hill where a few months later as he is reading in a paper of the engagement of the actress and the Prince she arrives at his home. She assures him that she is good not bad and that she did make the promise to the Prince when she believed he loved her and both the Hillman and his brother receive her as one of them.
