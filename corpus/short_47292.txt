'MY NAME IS JOHN' is the story of a young man's view of himself the world around him and his place in that world. His reflections are entirely his own. He shares his search for individuality his quest for identity and the evolution of his path to self-awareness. He bravely exposes himself. And while these are his thoughts they could just as easily be ours - as some things are indeed universal. Through him we are reminded that life really is a journey. Not a destination.
