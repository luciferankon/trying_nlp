Directed by Hava Beller an 85-year-old female Oscar-nominated filmmaker whose two prior films took her each over a decade to make. This one took even longer. She has a very distinct eye and style. The film explores the ongoing Palestinian/Jewish conflict in the Middle East it does not take the rose tinted view that "if they can build a bridge/perform a play/ work side by side in a hospital - that peace should not be impossible." This longitudinal study is a far more immersive tough authentic and keenly observed work than the scores we have all see before by exploring the lives of young people born into a life that is lived right on the conflict zone.
