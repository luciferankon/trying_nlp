In the second syndicated version of "Treasure Hunt" two female contestants were selected from the audience to open a surprise package on stage. One of the boxes was empty; the other contained a pop-up jack-in-the-box. The contestant selecting the latter box got to choose one of 66 surprise boxes on stage each containing a cash amount and an unknown prize. After host Edwards revealed the cash amount (between $700 to $1000) he offered the opportunity for the contestant to keep the cash or take whatever was inside the box. Prizes ranged from cars trips furs and jewelry furniture and appliances ... or they could be "klunks" (worthless nonsense prizes). Inside one of the boxes was a check for $20000 (plus $1000 for each show it was not claimed up to $50000). Whatever the contestant's choice Edwards then led a skit aimed at making the contestant believe she had won a "klunk." Whatever the outcome that contestant was declared champion and received opportunities to participate again. Two such "Treasure Hunts" were conducted per show. At the end of the program the show's bonded security agent revealed the whereabouts of the check if it hadn't already been found.
