The United States and Britain are preparing to wage war on Iraq for its undisclosed weapons of mass destruction but Israel's nuclear biological and chemical capabilities have yet remained un-inspected. Meanwhile Mordechai Vanunu has been imprisoned for 16 years for exposing Israel's secret nuclear bomb factory to the world back in the 1980's and is seen as a traitor in his own country. This film is the story of the nuclear-bomb Vanunu and Israel's wall of silence.
