Autistic since childhood filmmaker Adrian Esposito and his family have searched for a cure for his autism all of his life. One day Adrian accidentally stumbled upon some reel to reel tapes of Cherokee healer and visionary Rolling Thunder in his mother's basement. Impressed by Rolling Thunder's teachings he questioned whether Native American medicine men and healers could help him find a cure or at least help him deal with troublesome symptoms of his autism.
