The three principal characters accidentally escape from their Medieval peasant environ discover that the Ark's crew is long dead and the ship is adrift. They wander through the ship and its domes seeking help to regain control of the ship and humanity's destiny. The original Starlost TV series was broadcast by CTV in 1973.
