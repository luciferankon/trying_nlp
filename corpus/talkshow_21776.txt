The in-studio adventures of the horror-rock inspired tattooed aspiring actor-turned storyteller/talk show host A.J. 8 featuring actor writer videographer and spoken word artist Mike Phelan O'Toole as A.J.'s quick-witted co-host and the musical stylings of acoustic guitarist Dennis Roach. Guests include A.J.'s long-time friends and other Boston MA indie artists such as local surrealist filmmaker/poet Mick Cusimano. The horror themed set design features A.J. 8's less talkative permanent guest; a skeleton named G.R. 8. Produced by A.J. 8 Mike Phelan O'Toole and Lawrence Hollie. Directed by Lawrence Hollie.
