Szöke: the independent filmmaker the actor the moralizing mouth of Tilos Radio the grotesque humorist the psychologist... Whoever follows this man will meet a thousand faces but whatever he has to show is always astounding. The first part of the film is shot at Sziget where he attempts to present his own publicly private view of cultural chaos. The masseur the reporter the tour guide... Szöke and the Surroundings where we get to know a little about the man and a lot more about the island that is Sziget. The film comes back to pay him a visit a year later. It's summer again. But this time only he stands in the spotlight in Private Szöke.
