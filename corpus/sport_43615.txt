SuperBrawl is usually one of WCW's biggest PPV's of the year. This year SuperBrawl takes place at the legendary Cow Palace in San Francisco California. Hollywood Hogan and the new World order are running rampant through World Championship Wrestling. However this is a night WCW Superstars are fighting back against the renegade faction. The WCW Executive Board has named "Rowdy" Roddy Piper the number one contender for Hollywood Hogan's World Heavyweight Championship. Can Piper beat Hogan one more time only this time for the most coveted title in professional wrestling? The Giant and Lex Luger battle the nWo's Outsiders for the WCW Tag Team Championship. The catch is that WCW President Eric Bischoff has refused to allow Luger to participate in the match due to him not having a medical release in time. Bischoff is forcing The Giant to take on both Outsiders by himself for the WCW Tag Team Championship. Can The Giant pull through for World Championship Wrestling and all of its fans? The other headline match on the card is a San Francisco Death Match between Kevin Sullivan and Chris Benoit. Not only will it be a Death Match but Woman and Jacqueline will be strapped together at ringside bound by a leather strap. Don't miss WCW SuperBrawl VII!
