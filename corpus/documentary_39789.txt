Produced by sisters Devon and Autumn Terrill GORK! turns a spotlight on their charismatic younger brother Adam his complex mix of disabilities (autism ADHD) and his impact on their 7-member family. Tracing Adam's early years as a foster child through his high school graduation to his present-day life in a group home GORK! paints a compelling darkly comedic portrait of one family's experience with disability. GORK! zeroes in on Adam's close relationship with Autumn who eventually channels her experiences with Adam to create an unorthodox approach to working with autistic children. The film combines interviews photos verite video and scenes from live performances of Autumn's award-winning solo play (also called GORK!) bringing to life the stories of Adam's youth and his transition into adulthood. GORK! also portrays two parents who have been beaten down by a flawed system of care that they resent and yet rely upon raising important questions about how we treat people with special needs and their families.
