Custom treehouse builder Django Kroner and his Canopy Crew team take on a new treehouse build just outside Lexington Kentucky. Challenged by his clients' request to get them over 70 feet into the tree Django gets creative with a solution that takes him to the circus. Back at the tree Django and the guys battle Mother Nature to take the build higher than they've ever gone!
