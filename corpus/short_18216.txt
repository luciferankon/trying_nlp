Cris Cyborg is an MMA champion from Brazil and arguably one of the world's greatest fighters. But in 2011 Cyborg tested positive for steroids and the announcement compromised her title and eventually her career placing her on a one year suspension. Since her return to the ring she's tested negative for perfomance enhancing drugs though she continues to find herself vilified by the media and her peers. This type of scandal of course is not unique to Cyborg nor to mixed martial arts. In this episode of Broadly Meets fighter and host Jill Morley talks with Cyborg about steroids women fighters and her archenemy Ronda Rousey.
