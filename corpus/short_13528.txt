On Long Island an elderly woman in a wheelchair wants to see Long Beach. At the beach she is pushed along the boardwalk by a nurse. They arrive at a ramp. At this point the nurse bends over and accidentally bumps the wheelchair which is set in motion propelling the elderly lady into a series of encounters with a priest and others as the wheelchair continues to spin and gyrate.
