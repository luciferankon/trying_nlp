Celebrate a glimpse of the uncanny in this series of strange encounters both big and small that are woven together with the mundane and monotonous cycle of the past four years of a young female filmmaker's life as a college student in rural Maine and Vermont. Look closer and discover what hides in plain sight around her. This experimental short scrapes only the surface of four years of footage and highlights a pattern of familiar images pulled from the archives. This is an exploration of a monotonous cycle and a deconstruction of that reality. By distorting these images the familiar evolves into the unfamiliar and monotony transcends into mystery.
