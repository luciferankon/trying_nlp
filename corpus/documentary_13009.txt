In this documentary you will find out who Amy Winehouse truly is and was and why she is still searching for herself. In 2003 Amy Winehouse debuted her first album Frank. When she first burst onto the scene she was considered to be as soulful as the sultry sisters of yesteryear such as Ella Fitzgerald Billie Holiday Sarah Vaughn and Dina Washington. In 2008 that is no longer the case. Besides her controversial Grammy wins she has been shunned by the industry critics and artists by the likes of Natalie Cole and many others. This situation has arisen because of the young singers public display of hard alcohol and drug use. Amy Winehouse is a good girl gone train wreck with the help of husband Blake Fielder-Civil whom with no doubt helped create this monster.
