I'm in the South of France. My base? The high-tech testing ground for Formula One Circuit Paul Ricard. My mission? To find find my favorite car of the year. There's a pair of Ferraris the V12 6.3 liter FF and the 458. There's the UK challenger to the 458 McLaren's MP4-12C. The latest gizmo-laden Nissan GTR Porsche's GT2 RS the 570-horsepower Lamborghini Performante and the fun BMW 1M. Helping me are The Stig and Formula One new boy Karun Chandhok. I look into the future in the shape of the hybrid-engine Mugen Honda CR-Z And there are blasts from the past as well. The beautiful Eagle Speedster a modern twist on the iconic timeless E-Type with its 4.7 liter engine and an eye-watering ≈Å500000 price tag. And there's the all new Jensen Interceptor R with its 6.2 liter Corvette motor. The mighty Brutus a vintage car fitted with a flame-spitting BMW airplane engine. Also the single-seat B.A.C. Mono - capable of 0-60 in 2.8 seconds. What more could you want?.
