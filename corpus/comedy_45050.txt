Funny Married Stuff is a comedic web series about Lony'e and Peyton poking fun at one another while navigating through the confusing world of marriage and parenthood! The show is a parody on their daily lives as they try not to drive each other crazy dealing with topics of image sex communication and parenting. In the series the cast of friends and extended family is just as crazy as Lony'e & Peyton as they navigate their own issues and relationships while playing parodies of themselves. Funny Married Stuff was created to inspire those looking to get married and to remind married couples that although marriage is hard it's worth figuring out.
