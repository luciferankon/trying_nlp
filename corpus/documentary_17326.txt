In the documentary a directors point of view I went back to my childhood place where I spent four months every year. I am almost never there anymore yet I think of this place every day. I miss it so much. My old neighbors farmers from birth who took care of me while my mom was working are long dead and their houses empty since their kids have moved to bigger cities. And so have I.
