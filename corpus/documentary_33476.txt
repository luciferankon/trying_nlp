Nowhere to Hide follows a man - the medic and father Nori Sharif - through 5 years of dramatic change in the war-torn Diyala-province; one of the most dangerous provinces in the middle of Iraq. From the time of the American retreat to the fall of Nori's home town we follow him filming stories of survivors. In a world trapped between ISIS and the different Iraqi Militias his integrity and humanitarian vision is the only thing that drives him to continue against all odds. Even when as last man standing he is forced to turn the camera towards himself. We are given a unique insight into one of the worlds most dangerous and inaccessible areas - the "triangle of death" in central Iraq. We get to know and hear the stories of the people who live there; survivors of this 'new war" that has become the norm - where the enemy is invisible and there is nowhere to hide.
