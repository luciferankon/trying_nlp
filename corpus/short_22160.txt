In 1936 a small group of prominent screen directors pledged to work together to protect the economic and creative rights of filmmakers. Risking their careers they came together to form the Screen Directors Guild. DGA Moments in Time depicts not only the beginnings of what later became the Directors Guild of America but also the struggle of the Guild to receive formal recognition in Hollywood - as well as the Guild's own civil war as it attempted to fend off a Red Scare-inspired anti-communist purge that threatened its survival in 1950. These stories behind the Guild's founding and early years are told by Clint Eastwood Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg.
