Do we dare look back at memories so terrible that remembering may threaten the life we know today? Such is the story of the film TABU where two college students David an Armenian and Leyla a Turk dare their fate to forbidden love and the horror of the Armenian Genocide of 1915. To look back at those days most certainly will not be easy and will trigger events that are as yet unforeseeable for David and Leyla. There is no choice as events out of their control relentlessly push them forward to a recollection avoided for nearly 100 years.
