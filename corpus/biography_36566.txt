It is unique that a movie like that is created in Kazakhstan. Many thanks to the creators of the film - they have made a very bold and important step making this movie. A team of enthusiasts almost with no funds set a difficult task: to make an honest movie about modern Hamlet not only by non-professional actors but by actors with disabilities. And in my opinion makers coped with the task - to get important and necessary film "To be or not to be?" Very glad that Kazakhstan can talk about such problems with the language of cinema at such ease and flair. Already by the process of working on the film film directors: Aziz and Mukhamed have implemented a very important social project - helping disabled people to forget about their problems and feel full members of society plunged into the world of cinema.
