We have all heard of the wonderful things they do in India such as making flowers grow before our very eyes. Well this film shows something quite as wonderful. We see the pretty flowers forming themselves petal by petal and when the wreath is complete we are astonished to see a pretty girl's head in the heart of each blossom. The coloring is beautiful and all sorts of flowers are shown: roses daisies carnations etc. It is amusing to watch each petal with military exactness go right up to its proper place and we sit wondering just what kind of flower this particular one is to be. Sometimes it is hard to guess because so many tiny different parts go to make the complete flower as we know it.
