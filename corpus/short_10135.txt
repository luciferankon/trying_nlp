A dreamlike experimental film about the death of a lover. A woman dances slowly melancholically and seductively with a cast of the hands of her dead lover. She dances to exotic tropical music that can only exist in fantasy among the objects and memories collected over a lifetime in an old loft covered in spiderwebs. A piano stool a book of Beethoven sheet music a guitar a mirror a skull and dead flowers are some of the things in this film that evokes old 8mm films that could have been found in that attic.
