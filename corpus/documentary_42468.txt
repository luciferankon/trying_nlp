I Am A Woman Now (formerly Casablanca Revisited) the first generation of transsexuals who had their sex change in Casablanca back in the mid-1950s to 1960s take stock of their lives. Do these pioneers feel like total women and did it give them the fulfillment in life they expected ? The women featured in the film were all treated by the same 'miracle doctor' Georges Burou. As long as these 'patients' paid there were no pre-conditions no questions asked at his clinic in Casablanca. A film about the pursuit of an almost unattainable dream about the gap between its realization and the hard reality that sometimes follows.
