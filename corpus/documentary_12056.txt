Pauline Bewick: Yellow Man Grey Man examines the hugely successful series of work by Pauline known as The Yellow Man. The Yellow Man represents an ideal life style and philosophy and is widely known and much loved all over the world. However in the course of their long friendship Maurice discovered the existence of her Grey Man drawings dealing with a much darker side of the artist and much less well-known. Filmed in a series of pellucid Kerry locations this handsome film captures the charm and energy of one of Ireland's finest artists on her home ground.
