The men of Company K 3rd Battalion 5th Marine Regiment describe the ferocious battle for Peleliu "an island on fire." In conditions that tested the sanity of each man 9000 Marines attacked 10000 battle-hardened Japanese soldiers dug into hundreds of fortified and reinforced coral and limestone caves. 28 days of unrelenting battle with no quarter asked or given. The Marines' goal . . . to kill the enemy before they killed you.
