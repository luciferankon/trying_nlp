Italy is under attack. The invader is not a foreign state. The enemy is hard to identify but its presence on Italian territory is already so widespread and deep- rooted that it can easily be taken for an ally. It's legalized gambling a perfect money-making machine which last year alone whipped 100 billion euros out of Italians' pockets. An invisible tax paid voluntarily. A tax on the people. It is a vicious circle that has economic political media and cultural facets all adapted to a single overriding purpose: profit. But the people making the money are very few while those facing hardship and poverty are many. Because one thing is for sure - the only to win at gambling is to run the game.
