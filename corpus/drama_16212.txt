An innocent country girl who happens to have a lovely singing voice falls under the influence of a ruthless Broadway producer. At first she's dazzled by the producer's surface charm as well as those bright lights the title refers to but eventually gets a dose of reality (after accidentally becoming involved in a murder and a race against time to save a condemned man). The film also includes a truly hair-raising train crash.
