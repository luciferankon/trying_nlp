Mancow Muller's Chicago-based morning radio show shown now on local television. WPWR-TV/My50 presents "MANCOW!" -- the video simulcast of the "Mancow Experience" radio program. The news of the television simulcast for Erich "Mancow" Muller was first reported back on July 5th by the Chicago Tribune's Robert Channick. "This fall Chicagoans will get a backstage pass into one of the most provocative radio programs in this market. Viewers will have unlimited access into Mancow's madness with a live unedited simulcast that will bring this dynamic voice to life." The new "MANCOW!" show (yes it is spelled in all caps and with an exclamation point) will air from 6:00am-8:00am.
