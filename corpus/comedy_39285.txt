Matt Lucas is the host of his own awards ceremony the perfectly-titled 'Lucases'. Nominations are provided by Matt's three guests in categories that recognise all the areas of achievement sadly overlooked by other awards - whether it's Smuggest Nation of People Most Moreish Food or Crappiest Beatles Song. New for series 2 is a panel of celebrity judges one week it might be Sooty Sweep and Sue the next it might be Olympic Bronze Medalists who help determine the winner of each award. Matt is also assisted from the kitchen by his mum who chooses which guest will leave Matt's front room with the golden Lucas statue.
