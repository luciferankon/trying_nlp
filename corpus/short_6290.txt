Joana does not say a word but after Mariana leaves she takes her rival's drawing off the wall too. Next the teacher demands that the culprit for the ink bottle to accuse herself. Mariana doesn't - and Joana comes forward does taking the punishment she didn't deserve. Or did she? In a child-like ambiance the very adult themes of envy spying and fault.
