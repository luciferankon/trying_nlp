Deceptively simple and with unsettling intelligence "I Am Concrete" traces the intersection of six wounded lives through the memory of one man's mounting losses over the course of several years. Seemingly alone in his near-empty loft Jackson confides in himself and is forced to confront both the immediate space in which he currently exists and the consequences of his past decisions through a series of blindingly intense encounters. Silently narrated in part by an ominous physical presence the startling emotional truth hidden behind his deeply held passion for four women that have long since left him aspires toward more than revelation. Thus Jackson is left with a choice one that could possibly overtake and erase all evidence of the world around him.
