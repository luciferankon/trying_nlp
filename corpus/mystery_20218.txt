When a beautiful woman Crystal Taylor (Jenna Bodnar) meets a photographer Drake Van Horn (Patrick Williams) whose works exhibit a strangely macabre brand of eroticism she doesn't realize the danger in which she will place herself. She poses for him and upon seeing the photo unwittingly makes a Dorian Gray-type pact where she will remain eternally youthful while the the picture exhibits her true age.
