The second part covers the phenomenon where The Eagles officially quit but 1980s "Oldie" radio sent them into orbit. Glenn Frey having many talents acted in film and TV (Miami Vice). The others kept on singing separately. In the 1990s the band reunited and played the world. But it is all over as of 18 January 2016. RIP Glenn and The Eagles.
