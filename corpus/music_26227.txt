The definitive story of the band that brought the world such hits as "Still The One" "Dance With Me" "Dancin' in the Moonlight" to name just a few. Orleans started their journey almost 40 years ago as a trio in Woodstock NY. Since then they have had chart hits played venues and concerts all over the world and let their egos spark disagreements that would take them to the edge. This is their story - in their own words. In spite of their rocky road the members of Orleans have gone on to continue to play music together one to become a U.S. Representative and another on to the next life due to an overdose. This is the complete story of Orleans from the very beginning in their own words and unlike any other Orleans story ever told.
