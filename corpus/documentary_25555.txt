La Makabra is an old factory usually occupied by fifty squatters. It is open to the public and it works as a self-managed cultural center in the Poble Nou district in Barcelona. This social and artistic collective is affected by the Plan 22@ responsible for restructuring this district and therefore evacuating the building. In spite of this situation the squatters continue performing shows and cabarets because this is the way they use this space as opposed to commercial creativity.
