Reynaldo Salgado is a 48 year old afrocolombian boxer who works as a bait in Cartagena. In other words he gets paid to lose fights. One day Breyder a 12 years old boy from the street shows up claiming to be his son. And because Reynaldo is a womanizer that lacks of good memory (his head is starting to show the damages of so many fights) he accepts this boy as his son. In this journey Reynaldo finds someone that makes him feel important again and Breyder learns how to admire not the boxing champion but rather the middle class worker.
