Awkward socially dysfunctional Nathan writes strange poems buries jam in the park and converses with the voices. Voices that fight for his attention and demand his subordination. On his daily semi-hypnotic journeys through his alienating colorless city he searches for companionship and happiness. He thinks he finds it when he meets the girl he loves - but to whom he never speaks. This surreal magical and philosophically charged tale examines the life of an outcast as he struggles to blend into a world where everyone searches for their own uniqueness.
