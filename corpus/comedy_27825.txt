A fishing boat comes back to the port. Fishermen are crestfallen as they have caught only one very little fish. To save face they fib they have 300 kilo of mackerel on board the boat. In their will to report a success the port administration decides to pad out the weight. So the very little fish is grossly exaggerated into tons of belted bonito then into dolphin and ultimately into a whale. Which results in celebrations honors and awards... There naturally is no any whale. Instead of brilliant display of an unprecedented success the white collars make a brilliant display of their unparalleled foolishness.
