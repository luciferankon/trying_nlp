Inspired by the poem Lisbon Revisited (1923) signed by one of the heteronyms from the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa (Álvaro de Campos) spawns this audio-visual reflection on the written word versus the spoken word / image versus sound. The flow of voices and shapes creates a screen of moving figures that refer to metaphysical atmospheres in an exercise of exalted visual and sound textures. An audiovisual poem where sound and image texture combine to create an abstract pictorial composition inspired by artists like Dave McKean and Edgar Pęra.
