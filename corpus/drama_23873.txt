Bulgaria the night of October 18 1922. A rampageous young man - an American is forced to get off the Orient Express at a small station. The chief of the railway station and his daughter are quite unwilling to put up the stranger. Gradually the American wins their trust. When the father understands that his daughter has decided to go away to Paris with the American he makes a potion to sedate him and gets him on a train on the sly. In the morning all that has left from the guest is a piece of paper which reads "Ernest Hemingway".
