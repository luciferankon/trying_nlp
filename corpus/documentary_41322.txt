In 2014 twenty-two World War II veterans were presented with the opportunity to return to Normandy France to participate in 70th anniversary of D-Day celebrations. Most of the veterans had never returned to the ground on which they fought and many still felt resentment at their treatment by the French after the war. As they began traveling from town to town during the celebration crowds gathered around them wherever they went. They were treated as returning heros and celebrated for their actions decades before. Most surprising to them was the realization that stories of the invasion has been passed from generation to generation. During their visit the veterans were approached by young French children who not only thanked them for their service but genuinely knew of the sacrifices that they and others made during World War Two. Return To Normandy follows these veterans during the ten-day adventure that for many started as a simple vacation but in the end became an experience that would change their lives.
