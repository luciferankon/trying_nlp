Three survivors of the brutal Salvadoran Civil war reflect on their experiences during the conflict as well as the necessary post-war society wide process of forgiveness and rebuilding. Experienced from three vastly different perspectives (a female guerrilla military leader a Jesuit priest and a child) Great Love intentionally explores the war from a human view and also asks what comes after such terrible violence. For a brighter Salvadoran future the answer emerges: love forgiveness and reconciliation.
