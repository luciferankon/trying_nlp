It's an out-of-this-world story about a down-to-earth lesbian couple who got on their bicycles and rode 3800 miles across America to rally support for same-sex marriage. From San Francisco to New York City Elisia and Carrie Ross-Stone -- two lesbian grandmothers (from Mars Pennsylvania!) ride across mountain ranges through deserts and across prairies as they struggle through the mud-slinging of election year politics hateful protests and even death threats to show America that they're not alien life forms.
