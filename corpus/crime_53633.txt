In the morning twilight of Prague the dead body of the safe-breaker Toufar is found floating on the river Vltava with a knife in his back. Police inspectors visit Toufar's lover the prostitute Anna Kulatá ('Jirina Bohdalová' (qv)) nicknamed Umbrella and it is apparent that the moment before she opened the door of her flat someone fled through the window. Umbrella is summoned for examination to the head of the criminal police - Police Councilman Vacátko 'Jaroslav Marvan' (qv) but although shocked by the photograph of the dead man she does not confess to anything. Before Toufar Umbrella lived with the safe-breaker Penicka ('Radoslav Brzobohatý' (qv)) who loved her very much and made her quit her street trade. But when he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment Umbrella began to live with the brute Toufar who chased her to street again. In the case of the murder Penicka is therefore the prime suspect.
