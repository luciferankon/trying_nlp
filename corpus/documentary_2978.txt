A document of an audience imagining. An unattended camera observes an audience watching listening and in their own minds completing the film. Audience will be filmed at Museum of the Moving Image as members of the consenting public listen and watch Suitcase of Love and Shame-a film that privileges sound over image and compels the spectator to invent much of the visual. Viewers observe other viewers envisioning.
