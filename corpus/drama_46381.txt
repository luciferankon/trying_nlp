Meorav Yerushalmi brings to the screen for the first time the colorful hues of a traditional Jerusalem family. Shimon Sadeh a successful real estate developer is a widower. The series opens as a new relationship develops between him and Leah the young and self-assured woman who is to become his second wife. Shimon has three children. His sons each go their own ways--Efraim the eldest rebels against his father and prefers to study in Yeshiva. Itzik the second son rejects his father's ways by refusing to work in the family business and becoming a musician. Itzik will move in with Noa his secular girlfriend making the ultimate transformation and rebellion against his family. Ariella the strong-willed funny younger daughter is trying to find her own way through the maze of different directions standing before her. Eliahu the grandfather was formerly a highly esteemed Rabbi in Djerba but fell apart when he arrived in Israel and became an 'unknown'. This series explores the complex relationship between parents and children over four generations. The delicate mix of tears and laughter is largely the work of Oscar winning director Yankul Goldwasser who previously directed the popular series Reaching for Heaven and young director Nir Bergman who won the Israeli Oscar for his first film Broken Wings.
