Year after year there's war going on in the Canadian Rockies. The war against nature in one of the snowiest places in the world: British Columbia. On land and in the air Canadians do battle against massive amounts of snow threatening the infrastructure and the lives of their people. The threat: Avalanches. Unstoppable rumbling walls of thick snow 300 kilometers per hour fast tossing even huge boulders down the mountainsides like gravel. Clouds dense enough to suffocate any living creature within seconds. Blasts able to snap fully grown trees like twigs burying and destroying everything in their way. Down below: Highway No. 1 BC Canada. 16.000 vehicles a day the main artery between the coast and the interior of the country. A handful of men and women risking their lives to protect the streets railways and public against mother nature's forces. 24 hours a day 7 days a week. A film crew allowed for the first time ever to exclusively accompany the teams closely with 5K cinema cameras. The mission: To film their risky work in outstanding high end quality: The war against the snow in British Columbia Canada.
