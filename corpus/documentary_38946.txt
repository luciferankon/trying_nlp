Robert Falcon Scott's doomed attempt to be first to the South Pole became a race against his Norwegian rival Roald Amundsen. When Scott and his exhausted men arrived at the pole Amundsen's flag was already in place and before Scott and his team lay only starvation and death. Scott had been handpicked at the early age of nineteen as a man suitable to lead a British polar exploration. On his fateful second journey Scott made decisions which involved taking great risks and these still cause controversy today.
