As the most dammed dibbed and diverted river in the world struggles to support thirty million people and the peace-keeping agreement known as the Colorado River Pact reaches its limits this movie introduces hope. Can we meet the needs of a growing population in the face of rising temperatures and lower rainfall in an already arid land? Can we find harmony amongst the competing interests of cities agriculture industry recreation wildlife and indigenous communities with rights to the water?Sweeping through seven U.S. and two Mexican states the Colorado River is a lifeline to expanding populations and booming urban centers that demand water for drinking sanitation and energy generation. And with 70% of the rivers' water supporting agriculture the river already runs dry before it reaches its natural end at the Gulf of California. Unless action is taken the river will continue its retreat - a potentially catastrophic scenario for the millions who depend on it. We meet Jeff Ehlert a fly fishing guide in Rocky Mountain National Park Colorado rancher Dan James Delta restoration worker Edith Santiago Navajo Council member Glojean Todacheene Rifle Colorado Mayor Keith Lambert Los Angeles native Jimmy Lizama and a group of Outward Bound teens rafting down the Colorado River as they all reflect a compelling new water ethic-one that illuminates how letting go of the ways of old can lead to a path of coexisting with enough for all.
