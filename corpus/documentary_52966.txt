In March 2012 video game legend Tim Schafer made history with the Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter a crowdfunding campaign that changed the way games are created and funded forever. For three years a documentary crew captured the once-secretive process of video game development chronicling the creation of "Broken Age" from an idea to a finished game and beyond. Along the way Schafer and his team at Double Fine persevered through production delays internal strife financial crises looming deadlines sickness layoffs and the weighty expectations of a critical public. Featuring a cast of memorable personalities and accessible explanations on the process of game design the Double Fine Adventure is an entertaining glimpse into a fascinating and shockingly misunderstood industry.
