Behind the scenes of the BAFTA winning game Lumino City. Lumino City has been created in a unique way. Everything you see on screen was made using paper cardboard and glue culminating in the building of a 10 foot high model city. Laser cutting was used to create finely detailed environment and miniature lights and motors were built in to bring it to life. State of Play collaborated with award-winning architects fine-artists prop-makers and animators and each discipline brought something unique to the design and execution of the finished game.
