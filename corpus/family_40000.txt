To Tell the Truth has been one of Mark Goodson Productions' most durable formats and this 1990 represented the fourth revival of the popular game show. The format remained the same--three contestants claim to be associated with a story read as an affidavit at the start of each game. Only one is actually the person he claims to be; the other two are lying. The four celebrity panelists one at a time question the three contestants (addressing them by No. 1 No. 2. and No. 3) in an attempt to expose the liars and determine who was telling the truth. After all four celebrities have had their turn to question the team they voted separately as to who they thought was the real person associated with the story. Payoffs were based on the team's ability to fool the panel - $500 per incorrect vote and $3000 if they fooled all four panelists. Two such games were played per show. After the second game a new segment "One on One" was played with two more contestants one an audience member and another with two stories to share though he was associated with just one. The four panelists in turn ask the second contestant one question regarding each story. The audience member then had to guess which story he/she thought was true. If the audience member was correct he/she won $500; if not the contestant won the money. The 4th Edition of the classic game show. The Impostors presented by the announcer and the cross-examiners questioned 3 of them. They vote for 1 2 or 3. Every wrong vote worth $500 and eventually $1000 extra for the same wrong vote and $3000 for the wrong votes by landslide. Then came "One on One" for $500 to 1 audience member to pick the true story of the 2 possible professions and questioned by the cross-examiners.
