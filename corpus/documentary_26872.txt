Invited by the Palestinian government to run a filmmaking course for children Vincenzo Marra wanting to find out about the real situation in this country and express his findings through this film. A poignant documentary about Palestine 58% depicts the everyday life of the people a life in which the Israeli-Palestine conflict plays a preponderant role. From Jerusalem to Ramallah via Nablus the most dangerous town in the country we are shown refugee camps the border check-points a meeting with the mother of the first female suicide bomber as well as a speech by Yasser Arafat. But the film also conveys something of Palestinian customs as well as the beauty of the landscape. Despite the saturated media coverage of this region the filmmaker provides an alternative viewpoint since he considers daily life as a whole without losing sight of the fact that Palestine is above all an occupied territory from which 58% of the land has been annexed!
