Four angelic stray mutts descend upon a small Pacific Northwest town to show its residents the true meaning of Christmas. Unlike the usual canine caper this is not a story with talking dogs or rocket propelled sleighs. Rather it employs magical realism in an ensemble "dramedy" that features four extraordinarily real dogs who rekindle the holiday spirit in four very needy humans. The story opens with a brief look into the past - 4000 years ago - when an indigenous human first bonds with a wild dog or more accurately - when a dog first gives its undying love and trust to man. Flash forward to modern day - two days before Christmas in Kalapoo Falls where our four dogs will soon give their undying love and trust to our four very special humans.
