CLIM8 presents an abstract perspective shift on climate change exploring concepts about human delusions myth-making and self-induced disaster in the format of an experimental documentary. The film is broken into four chapter exploring denial impatience confusion and fatalism-all of which are obstacles to dealing with negative human impact on the environment. Using an abstract framework we attempted to conjure these themes in mini-image stories told with minimal text no dialogue and a mix of motion graphics non-cellular animation and digital footage. Although the film is complete on its own the diverse and moving score contributes to this emotional experience most powerfully when performed live.
