Crista De Leon (a gay spoken word artist) loves to write and perform for a crowd. She spends her days at her restaurant job and school but she can't wait for the sun to go down so she can do what she does best - poetry. Her life is pretty routine until she meets Damien. He's an out of towner in NYC to see some friends and visit his mothers grave. When they meet they learn new things about themselves and each other they never knew existed. The moments they share will last a lifetime.
