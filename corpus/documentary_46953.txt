In October 2011 Hiromi Kawaguchi leader of the Akahama District in Otsuchi a coastal town hit by the Great East Japan Earthquake opposed the central government's plan to build a 14.5-meter high embankment saying 'we cannot fight and win against nature.' They believe the only option is to move to higher land out of the reach of future tsunami. In March 2016 five years have passed since the Great East Japan Earthquake. However many residents there are still living in temporary accommodation. An increasing number of families have given up rebuilding their homes because rebuilding costs have doubled since the disaster. On the other hand a US$ 8.3 billion government project to build a huge embankment along the coast of Tohoku is moving steadily forward. This film will show how a public works project takes priority over the lives of the residents and investigates the central government's rigid polices block reconstruction from the disaster while asking what it means for local people to have autonomy.
