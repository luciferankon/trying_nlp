First there was an opportunity......then there was a betrayal. Twenty years have gone by. Much has changed but just as much remains the same. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) returns to the only place he can ever call home. They are waiting for him: Spud (Ewen Bremner) Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Other old friends are waiting too: sorrow loss joy vengeance hatred friendship love longing fear regret diamorphine self-destruction and mortal danger they are all lined up to welcome him ready to join the dance. 20 years after betraying his friends and running off with (almost) all the money from a scam Mark Renton is back in Edinburgh. It is his first time back since the events that split him Spud and Simon apart. He looks up Spud and Simon but their lives are hardly much better than when he last saw them. Spud after getting his life together has seen it all unravel to the point that he is suicidal. Simon is running his father's loss-making pub in between bouts of blackmail. Meanwhile the fourth person in their caper of 20 years' ago the psychotically intense Begbie is in jail. He has no intention of staying incarcerated and revenge is foremost on his mind.
