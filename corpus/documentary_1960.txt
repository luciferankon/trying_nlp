In the summer of 2007 as a Stanford University student Sarah Golabek-Goldman traveled to Poland to teach English in the village of Zakliczyn. While there she also visited the towns where her family lived before World War II to search for Poles who remembered her relatives. In the village of Jasionowka Sarah discovered the gravestone of her great-great-grandmother Leah Tickotsky. Finding Leah Tickotsky explores Polish-Jewish relations as well as one filmmaker's personal journey to discover her family roots. Through her eyes Finding Leah Tickotsky provides a perspective on one of the most painful periods in history and serves as a reminder of the extraordinary contributions Jews made to Poland over nine centuries.
