This is an impression of the 1982 folk festival at the Tracy and Eloise Schwarz farm in Central Pennsylvania. The festival dedicated to the legendary Elizabeth Cotton includes Bluegrass Old Timey Cajun Country and Gospel music. In contrast to the casual atmosphere of the festival the film is an elaborately collaged image with shapes derived from traditional Pennsylvania Dutch designs. While sometimes the music seems to animate the image at others the image itself becomes a kind of visual music eliciting ephemeral sensuousness. The film is a unique meeting of the folk tradition and the avant garde implying a fundamental connection between the two.
