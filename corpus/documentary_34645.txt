Join the Hubbard family - father mother and two small children - on safari. Encounter giraffes hippos leopards and crocodiles; share the terror when a grass fire engulfs the Hubbards' camp; share the fun when pet monkeys join the expedition; and witness a hyena/lioness battle and a heart-stopping lion attack on the Hubbard's oxen.
