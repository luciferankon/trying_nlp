A typical mid-30s entry from the Maury M. Cohen Invincible arm of Chesterfield Pictures shot in the usual static style of Frank R. Strayer who moved the camera maybe twice for a medium close-up probably under orders not to from producer Cohen who knew moving the camera cost time and money. This one has good-girl Dorothy Brooks being summoned to the apartment of her department store boss Mr. Dickman who accuses her of stealing lingerie from the store but if she will be nice and kiss him he won't turn her in. She shoves him away and he tumbles (off-camera of course) out of the second story window. Dorothy flees with the aid of her friend Kitty Kennedy and she soon encounters Donald Cabot Jr. who unknown to her is the son of the department store owner. He of course also doesn't know she is an employee of his father's store wanted for assault and theft. No surprises from this point to the happy ending. Dickman the cad naturally turns out to be the lingerie thief.
