Fact-based story about the sexual harassment suit filed by Anita Hill during the appointment trials of Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court during the George Bush presidential administration. The film gives both parties a fairly even presentation and does not try to assess blame. It does however show a lot of background political maneuvering that took place particularly on the part of Kenneth Duberstein an administrative spin doctor.
