Four years later the wildly popular cult hit still enjoys a rabid fanbase-many of whom feel the series was cancelled much too soon. These same fans will be delighted to see their favorite stars brought together once again as the amiable cast openly discusses many behind-the-scenes anecdotes and stories from their time on set. The cast's favorite memories-such as Sock's lusty encounter with Gladys; the creators' insider info that comedic icon Louis C.K. originally auditioned for the part of the Devil; and whether or not the team would be open to a Kickstarter campaign to resurrect REAPER are just a few of the things fans can expect to glean from the special.
