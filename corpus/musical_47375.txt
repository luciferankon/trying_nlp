An impresario comes to Bulgaria from abroad to engage an opera artist. His opera company urgently needs a Mephistopheles for their imminent premiere of "Faust". Only basso Nicolai Ghiaurov can help them out of the fix but he is away concertizing around the country. The impresario decides to find him. Ghiaurov however proves quite elusive and the impresario just misses him wherever he goes. The concert Ghiaurov is giving at the Summer Theatre in seaside resort is the impresario's last chance of engaging him. Meanwhile trying to catch Ghiaurov up the guest has an opportunity to listen to other Bulgarian performers. Pleasantly surprised by the talent of our opera artists the impresario is willing to engage just about everybody...
