Overfart is a disembodied passage through a landscape which is inaccessible to humans a landscape which is not a part of nature but an intellectual construct: In its artificiality this work refers to Early-Romantic landscape painting­especially that of C.D. Friedrich­and its immanent religiosity. Though temko by general magic is virtually the sole element of the soundtrack this work was not intended to be a music video. The abstract spatiality of the music which was apparently set in contrast to the images and their cycles complement one another to produce the same intangibility. (Ben Pointeker)
