A film about machines and humans trapped inside them. A film about Industrial landscapes that act as counter-intuitive symbols - disconnected from the human spirit. The photographic method utilized is intended to artistically present a hidden visual aesthetic. Integral to delivering the emotional impact of the film is a haunting psycho-active sound-scape by ambient-electronic musician 'A Produce'.
