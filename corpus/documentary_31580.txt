A temple in the suburbs of Ulaanbaatar is home to young orphan girls. A railway track runs near by. Far away auburn hills loom. The girls help with religious ceremonies read books study English and skip rope. The temple is saturated with a parched tranquility. Like a temporary station the only references to the outside world are the sounds of an occasional train passing and radio commentary about the economic imperialism of foreign corporations.
