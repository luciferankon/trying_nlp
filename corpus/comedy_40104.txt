A second hand sales store manager (Theresa Cole) tries in vain to make a success of her charity shop. Her efforts to convince her staff that the shop is at the high end of the charity market falls upon the ears of a mixed bunch of apathetic voluntary workers. Life is what it is and very little changes unless new customers grace the shop floor.
