Two strangers meet when they respond to an ad in The New York Times for a river view apartment. Paul Friedman is a married advertising copywriter; Ann Miller a discontented housewife. They view the apartment but before they can leave discover that the door has accidentally been locked and they are now trapped inside together. A connection quickly forms between them as they begin sharing things about their lives and they find themselves attracted to one another.
