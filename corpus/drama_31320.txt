This is the story of the first and biggest cocaine trafficker in the United States. This is the story of Griselda Blanco. This story and screenplay started in 2012 with a dangerous journey to Medellin Colombia when the news came about the murder of Griselda Blanco. We tracked down and found the people that grew up with Griselda her family members her captain of her hit man team and many more all people that worked with her and were very close to her. All the stories and documentaries that are currently out there about Griselda Blanco are from people that only met her or knew her off and on for less than one year these interviews prove that the stories that are currently out there about Griselda are inaccurate and fabricated. This story comes from people that lived and grew up with her since childhood all the way to her death. These are all first time ever interviews never before heard stories told for the very first time. These are the most accurate stories and information about the Godmother the Queen of Cocaine.
