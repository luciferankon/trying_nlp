The first solo tour from the singer of Fleetwood Mac is a knockout! Touring after her first solo album release Bella Donna and this filmed concert is the last night of her very short tour before heading back into the studio to record the next Fleetwood Mac album Mirage. This is a brilliant concert from one magnificent lady. Stevie Nicks in Concert is a must have in any music collection.
