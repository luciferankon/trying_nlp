The untold origin story of Sherlock Holmes. There have been over 200 Sherlock Holmes movies but this story the first ever written by Arthur Conan Doyle in which Holmes and Watson meet and Watson goes on his first case with Holmes has never been made into a movie. It's 1881 in Afghanistan and John Watson a handsome Army doctor fresh out of medical school is shot in the Battle of Maiwand one of the worst defeats in English military history. While recovering in Afghanistan he contracts a horrendous fever and nearly dies and is sent back to London to recover. Too weak to work he needs to share rooms and is introduced to a brilliant enigmatic man of 27 engaged in mysterious scientific research Sherlock Holmes. Watson soon learns that Holmes is a consulting detective the only one of his kind in the world. When Holmes is summoned by Scotland Yard to the scene of a gruesome baffling murder of an American he invites Watson to join him. Together they unravel a tangled thread of murder that extends back 25 years to the settling of the American West and ends in London but not before Watson witnesses firsthand the astonishing mental and physical abilities of Sherlock Holmes including a wild wagon-chase through London and Holmes' fight to near-death with the murderer.
