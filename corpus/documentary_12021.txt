American Faust: From Condi to Neo-Condi is about Condoleezza Rice an extraordinary but little-understood woman who rose from segregated Alabama to become the most powerful woman in the world. Incisive and shocking this is the first retrospective film on the Bush Administration. It overturns the popular misconception of Rice as a yes-woman to President Bush to reveal her as his most enduring confidante - and thus responsible for much of the Bush legacy. This political biographical documentary tells a Faustian story of a woman whose hubris tempted her into a pursuit of power that destroyed her core values and hurtled America into a perilous new direction. Dr Rice leads her own defense through a series of candid interviews.
