Kurdjali is a town in Rhodopa Mountains. Its population is mixed between Bulgarian and Turks. The summer of 2001. No election campaigns. No shocking news. Several personal stories of women between 15 and 88. From different ethnic groups and religions sometimes in unusual combinations. They have different (or perhaps the same) dreams. In that region of diminishing population life carries on its silent battle.
