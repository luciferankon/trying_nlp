A satire set in 1899 Spain. Young Juan Antonio has been challenged to defend the honor of the beautiful yet devilish Carmen by Seńor Maximiliano a decorated military officer who has just returned from the Spanish-American War. Believing that he is the "World's Greatest Swordsman" Juan Antonio merrily accepts the challenge until he learns that the duel will be fought with pistols not swords. Neither Juan Antonio nor Seńor Maximiliano know what they are in for when the tables are turned by the sly Carmen.
