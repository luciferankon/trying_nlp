Meadow Bridge is a coming-of-age story that follows Darcy a fourteen-year-old girl growing up in a small West Virginia town in the late 1990s. It's a story about growing up on the edge of poverty and possibility - about trying to reach out into the bigger world while wrestling with where you're from.
