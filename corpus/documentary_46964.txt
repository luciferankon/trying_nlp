It has been cynically established that development aid has turned into a lucrative industry from which many Europeans are making a decent living however it is making poor countries increasingly dependent in the first place. Because of the worldwide financial crisis a country such as the Netherlands is donating seriously less money to developing countries. In fact serious efforts are made to combine help with trade relations. Private individuals are more and more reluctant to contribute financially claiming they have no idea how the money is spent. "But then again should we abandon those deprived people leaving them to face their destiny?" others wonder. So this group has decided to take action and roll up sleeves. Two small groups with totally different backgrounds and motives will be travelling separately across Ethiopia. Their adventures and encounters on the road help us to understand this truly complex issue. These are personal tales set against the background of the Big Story about a continent on the move: Africa. Africa. Only ten years ago it was doomed to perish. Or so we thought. Africa... 'the lost continent'. But there can be no doubt about this: the balance of power in Africa is overturning and is by no means what it used to be. The well-meaning Westerner must reconsider his position. Forengie...Forengie is a film brimming with good intentions misunderstandings and dilemmas but at times it is also hilariously funny.
