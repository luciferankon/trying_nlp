Monsieur Hulot goes on a holiday to a seaside resort but accidents and misunderstandings follow him where ever he goes. The peace and quiet of the hotel guests don't last very long with Hulot around because although his intensions are good they always turn out catastrophically. The summer holidays have arrived and the bumbling Monsieur Hulot - along with everyone else - heads for the seaside. Hulot is something of an innocent. Pretty well everything he touches goes bad but he is oblivious to the havoc he creates everywhere he goes. Whether it be eating in the dining room painting a boat or playing tennis his life is an adventure for everyone around him. It's the summer holiday season in Europe and M. Hulot like many others has decided to spend his vacation at the French seaside specifically at l'Hotel de la Plage resort. Quite often with a pipe in his mouth Hulot is a pretty quiet fellow but that still does not stop him from getting into a lot of trouble while there. Although he does get along with many of the other resort guests - such as the Englishwoman who is amazed at the effectiveness of his unique tennis style or the beautiful Martine - most unfortunately must deal with the bad outcomes of his unintentionally bumbling albeit good-natured actions. On the most part Hulot is unaware of what problems he is causing as he lives primarily in the moment of only what he himself is doing.
