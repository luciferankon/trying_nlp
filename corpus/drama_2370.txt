A man's life seems to be falling apart. He's bored with his job gets passed over for a promotion and when the pressures get to be too much he tries to commit suicide but he even fails at that and manages only to cripple himself instead of killing himself. Forced to stay at home he finds the role of "househusband" enjoyable--until his wife takes a low-paying job with his old company and rapidly rises up the corporate ladder.
