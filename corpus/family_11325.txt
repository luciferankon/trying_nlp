What do bats otters badgers and a parrot have in common? They all get by with a little help from their friends - Bob and his can-do construction team! Wendy finds that Farmer Pickles' fence blocks the badgers' path to the stream so she teams up with Bob to build a "badger gate" for them. Then Molly discovers a family of otters in the stream and comes up with a "mucky" solution to keep her new friends from being scared. Mr. Beasley provides a home for the bats in the belfry after his pigeons have flown the coop. Finally Molly and JJ are thrilled when Hamish the parrot needs a new home - their building yard is just the place for their new friend! Making friends and helping friends - it's all in a day's work!
