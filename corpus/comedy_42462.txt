A coming of age comedy about Life in Orlando FL and what it's like working at America's #1 Theme Park: The Adventure Kingdom of FUN! It is a day of reckoning for Julian Salinger and Spencer Hendricks. In just twenty-four hours the two young men mid-twenties and ambitious despite their generation's 'slacker' status will leave their adopted home in Orlando Florida for yet another faux hometown Hollywood. We meet the boys on their last day of work in one eight-hour shift the two young men and their core group of friends - Audrey Parker Lauren and 'Crazy Eddie' - experience every reason to run screaming from the theme park industry each one progressively more horrifying...and hilarious.
