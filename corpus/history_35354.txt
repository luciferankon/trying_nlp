Hans: A Case Study is a modern fable based on Sigmund Freud's 1909 landmark case study "Little Hans: Analysis of a Phobia in a Five Year old Boy". Hans is a hero's tale of a young boy's escape from the imposition of neurosis into revelation of self. Writer/director David Pilot brought the historic case to the stage at New York's West End Theater. "The HANS Project" developed over a four-month collaboration with actors musicians artists and Freudian scholars. The ensemble explored the hidden dimensions of the case in an improvisational environment creating an expressionistic dreamlike play that conjured the imaginary and real world of little Hans.
