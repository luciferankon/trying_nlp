See how submarines help scientists learn about life deep in the ocean. Watch a research sub in action thousands of feet deep! "This movie is wonderful. I teach 4th grade and also have a son serving on a Trident submarine (the submarine shown on the video). I use it as a combined Science Social Studies and Language Arts lesson. The kids enjoy the "science" lesson they learn and then are able to use the information they learn to write messages and create artwork to send to my son's crew before they leave on deployments. The language used makes learning about life on a submarine easy to understand and all the kids have nothing but positive comments when they are finished viewing the movie. They are really concerned about sending the sailors positive messages and want to let them know they appreciate what they do. A great video and teaching tool!" - LS
