A top salesman with a U.K. toy firm foolishly brings an expensive watch back from a German trip for his wife's birthday. This is illegal in 1950's Britain and when Customs discover the watch he is charged and unusually given a prison sentence. Not having the money to appeal he has to serve his time hoping the details don't get out and he won't lose his job.
