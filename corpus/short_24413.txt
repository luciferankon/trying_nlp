Casa De Casas was a booming Mexican restaurant in the 90's and early 2000's but now it has become a mere shadow if itself. Carlos Casas (the son of the owner Hector Casas) wants to change everything and bring back the business but his father thinks differently. He cares about his mothers' recipes and wants to keep the tradition while Carlos wants to spice it up. Carlos Casas (Bencomo) wants to bring a fresh new menu to his father's restaurant 'Casa De Casas' but Hector Casas (Luera) thinks otherwise. The two never have seen eye to eye and when the family business is in peril. A decision must be made quick.
