Who was Mary Magdalene? Was she a redeemed prostitute? Was she a high priestess from a different religious tradition embracing fertility rituals? Magdalene Unveiled takes us into the world of the ancient and modern sacred prostitute. This 2-DVD set explores the mystique of Mary Magdalene and other archetypal symbols of a primordial sacred-sexual role. Contemporary women and men known as sacred intimates tantrikas sexual healers dakas/dakinis and sexual shamans share their lives and their visions. Presenters include: followers of Mary Magdalene; Western Tantra teachers; a porn star; a Tibetan Buddhist lama; an African Nubian-Khamite priestess; a Native American shaman; an Episcopal priest. The contemporary sacred prostitute no longer has a public temple where she or he can share the ceremonies openly. There is little or no lineage to reveal the sacred mysteries from high priest/ess to initiate. Legally socially religiously the sacred prostitute has been out in the cold - until now!
