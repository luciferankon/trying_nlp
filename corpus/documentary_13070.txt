Political empowerment for Latinos in the United States has always faced adverse circumstances. From poll taxes and gerrymandering to outright intimidation Latinos have been kept from the ballot box in both local and national elections throughout history. A Mexican-American butcher's son from San Antonio Texas Willie Velasquez questioned the lack of Latino representation in his city's government propelling him into a lifelong battle to gain political equality for Latinos. Velasquez grew up to become a student activist leader of the Latino Civil Rights Movement and eventually the leader of one of the most important efforts in the history of Latino empowerment in America. He started a grassroots movement that changed the nation's political landscape and paved the way for the growing power of the Latino vote. Willie Velasquez: Your Vote is Your Voice examines the obstacles Latinos had to overcome to obtain representation and addresses the contemporary issues facing Latinos today.
