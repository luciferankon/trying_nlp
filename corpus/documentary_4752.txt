This is no ordinary art history programme but a fascinating and contemporary scientific detective story using a combination of observational documentary and dramatic reconstruction. The film follows three stories from the case file of Dr Maurizio Seracini: it also paints an engaging portrait of Seracini himself. Modern day Renaissance man self-made art expert and enemy of many traditionalist art historians. Dr Maurizio Seracini is a pioneering scientist who has made his name by ingeniously adapting the latest medical and military technology to reveal the secrets of great art works. This film follows Seracini on his controversial journey to solve two specific Leonardo mysteries - the location of the lost mural The Battle of Anghiari and a remarkable new story he has uncovered about Leonardo's great unfinished alter piece The Adoration of the Magi.
