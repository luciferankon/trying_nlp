This Tuesday is gonna be Super...Fictional political drama about the controversial 1960 US Election. Republican Senator Jack Cassidy's mob connections landed him the nomination. They might not land him the Presidency if the public believe the truth. Vote rigging scandals and a hit list. This President-elect has more than just a four year term to think about if he wins. His campaign aide is pregnant and Mae his wife of ten years sees their respective infidelities as necessary political evils. With time comes enemies. Power presents opportunities of abuse. Corruption abounds.
