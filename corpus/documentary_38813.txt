On April 20 2010 BP's Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded killing eleven men and unleashing over 200 million gallons of oil into the water. The U.S. Coast Guard immediately approved the use of a highly toxic compound called Corexit to be applied by BP to disperse the oil and ostensibly to prevent the oil from saturating the marshes and shorelines throughout the U.S. Gulf coastal region. Three months later the leaking wellhead was finally capped and the public was assured that the water seafood and beaches were safe. This is far from the truth. "Stealing Our Future" presents for the first time the complete story of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill and the aftermath that has and will exist for years to come. Revealing rarely seen footage of the rig explosion oil spill and contamination and featuring interviews with those directly affected by the tragedy the film details how the devastation and contamination is far more widespread than ever reported. "Stealing Our Future" documents the immeasurable cost to human health and wildlife from the disaster - impacts that will be ongoing for years to come - resulting from the calculated use of toxic dispersants in an attempt to hide the oil and reduce BP's liability. The film also examines the legal battles against BP and whether the industry stands any better chance of preventing or responding to another similar catastrophe in the future - especially relevant in a time when federal officials seek to open additional waters for drilling. Filmed on location throughout the Gulf coastal region from 2010 through 2015 "Stealing Our Future" is the untold story of how the carelessness that led to one of the biggest environmental disasters in US history has become a devastating human tragedy that continues to this day.
