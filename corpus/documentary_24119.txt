During Spring Break 2009 four undergraduate students traveled to New York City Philadelphia and Washington D.C. to film interviews with six IUP alumni about their experiences in college and in their professional and personal lives. The result is RoadTrip IUP a video inspired by the PBS documentary and series RoadTrip Nation. The founders of RoadTrip Nation sought to help students explore their potential future paths by seeking the stories of individuals who have chosen to live life based on what they are passionate about.
