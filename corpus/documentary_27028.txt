This documentary film was made at the request of the Szombathely chapter of the Hungarian Maltese Charity Service. The treatment and recovery of children suffering from cancer at the Oncology Centre of West Hungary has reached a new phase in the last few years: a significant number of children treated there have recovered. Beyond the advances in medical science this success may also be credited to the great humanity of the director Dr. Peter Masat. The film depicts the lives of two families; despite the fact that the parents lost their children due to their newly found faith they have become stronger and gained spiritually rich and fulfilling lives.
