In 1941 21 year old Elizabeth Rockwell opened a gallery in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. This little gallery 'Outlines' showcased the works of now iconic artists such as Alexander Calder John Cage Maya Deren Merce Cunningham and more. Outlines featured performances lectures music and film and hosted many exhibits before it was finally forced to close its doors in 1947 due to lack of support. With the recent discovery of the gallery chronology and two scrapbooks kept by Elizabeth Rockwell Cayce Mell set out on a journey of discovery and uncovered a missing piece of history.
