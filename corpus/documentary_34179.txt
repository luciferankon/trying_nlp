You may already know the story from newspaper and television reports. Captain Michaud the 74-year-old Gaspe native with a crazy scheme to build and outfit a 47-foot crabber to take medicine books bicycles and computers to the people of Haiti. He'd make the trip himself of course from Sainte-Anne-des-Monts to Port-au-Prince. The former sailor has been relying on his wits and his own steam but he isn't out of the woods yet. Between the motor breaking down the storms and the hold-ups at Haitian customs we begin to wonder of the Marie-Aimee will ever deliver her cargo. Filmmaker Yann Langevin agreed to be pulled along in the Captain's wake and this is his good-natured ?boat movie? about a mischievous resourceful character who speaks his mind (delightfully!) in moments of stubbornness anger and passionate determination. How will the odyssey from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the West Indies end' Find out here and get some sun and dreamtime in while you're at it.
