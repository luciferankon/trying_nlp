Eccentric hedonistic Berlin lawyer Joachim Vernau leaves remodeling the practice to his practical partner -or given her fall the nosy neighbor crones- to accept a strange mission: check in Habana if Katherina Gebhardt rightly assumed having seen a glimpse of him on a flight thereto never having got a word since his disappearance during the Cold war after a 1980 violent demonstration and settle their father's inheritance. Vernau sort of stumbles on the rail at his hotel in the persons of a fake hostess a henchman of the elusive Martin Gebhardt and someone even closer to him. Attempts to scare him off and even advice from the German embassy failing Vernaus is invited to Martin's Cuban estate where he lives with his daughter. Vernau happily accepts the signing over of all rights on the family home and the refusal even to consider contacting Katharine but she claims it's an impostor. Vernau reluctantly accepts to stay on and find out in which process nobody proves who they seemed so far.
