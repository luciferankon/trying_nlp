In 2016 we lost one of our greatest filmmakers. Paying direct homage to Kiarostami's 'Five' 'Seven' examines the city of Toronto through the same unblinking unmoving eye that Kiarostami examined the Caspian Sea in his seminal work. Accompanied by Bach's Goldberg Variations the images ask the audience to deal with both the banality and beauty of a city held captive by the dull grey winter.
