'Hazardous Light' begins with a short riff on consciousness in cinema -- and goes on to describe the journey of several filmmakers who invented German Expressionist Cinema -- -- and forced to flee Germany -- helped invent American Film Noir in Hollywood. It focuses not on the physical journey of these filmmakers - but on the depth and darkness of their vision. Call it "Weimar Noir". It also tells the story of a boy growing up in the Bronx who develops a deep passion for haunted heroes and femmes fatales.
