It is the story of Thoma with no identityseen here and there around the village work sometimes for living. He had disobeyed all the 10 commandments. And was buried in place where all the outlaws are buried. Much to the shock of the church members his body was found intact after 6 months of burial when they dug his grave to bury another outlaw. If the body is not decomposed the Church believes that the person has to be a saint. How could a man who broke all the 10 commandments and more be a saint?.The church committee start evaluating Thoma's life
