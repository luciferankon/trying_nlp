Hometown Habitat Stories of Bringing Nature Home is a 90-minute environmental education documentary focused on showing how and why native plants are critical to the survival and vitality of local ecosystems. Hometown Habitat features renowned entomologist Dr. Douglas Tallamy whose research books and lectures on the use of non-native plants in landscaping sound the alarm about habitat and species loss. Tallamy provides the narrative thread that challenges the notion that humans are here and nature is someplace else. "It doesn't have to and shouldn't be that way." Inspiring stories of community commitment to conservation landscaping illustrate Tallamy's vision by showing how humans and nature can co-exist with mutual benefits. The message: All of us have the power to support habitat for wildlife and bring natural beauty to our patch of the earth. The goal: Build a new army of habitat heroes!
