Two people find themselves on the precipice of romance. Their personal convergence parallels NASA's exploration of space and echoes of JFK's once and future dream. Specifically the Apollo 11 voyage to the moon and JFK's 1962 speech ennobling cosmic quests are entwined with our characters' encounter. The micro and macro of human life are showcased through cross-cutting techniques. Both narratives underscore our film's essential theme; that love is the essence of all exploration and it is indeed the greatest adventure of all. Space exploration of all scales is born out of our internal need to connect externally. The title "Guidance is Internal" was originally uttered during the Apollo 11 launch countdown and serves as a thematic bridge between the two stories. On one hand we have two characters whose internal desire to connect catalyzes their external actions to communicate. On the other hand we have the culminating efforts of humanity literally reaching for the stars in hopes of better understanding our place in the universe. Ultimately what does each existential excursion into the unknown grant us? An understanding that we are not alone. For our two characters their connection is forged by a mutual understanding and feeling for life. For the human race witnessing our planet from the heavens imbues in us with an understanding of our innate interconnectivity. In both cases a greater harmony is achieved. This is the story of two potential lovers (Collin Varney and Sondra Glass) on a journey to connect interwoven with the Apollo 11 Moon landing and JFK's rousing 1962 speech at Rice University. The over-arching theme of our interconnectivity through exploration and our subsequent place in the universe is personified through these duel narratives.
