This series which was initially a television movie about modelling. The character of Racine the modelling agent is there. As are the two young models Taryn Blake who has been modelling since she could walk and has a svengali for a motherJulia who sees her more as a meal ticket than as a daughter and knows that the day is coming near when all of her daughters payments will go directly to her and Laurie Caswell the innocent who doesn't really want to do it but is being pestered by Racine who sees her as the next hot commodity. Also thrown into the mix are Laurie's parents Dinah and Michael who are at odds over Laurie's modelling. Also added is Harper World Wide whose perfume company uses Racine's models for their ads. Wesley Harper who is in charge of that division is constantly having his head bitten off by his father Grant who treats his daughter Blair quite reciprocally. So Wesley grows to resent his father and is plotting to not only have his deposed as head of the company but also ruin his marriage to his second wife Marjorie. He also has it in for Blair's husband David who runs a sportswear company. Set in Manhattan this delightfully witty primetime serial focused on the cut-throat worlds of modeling and cosmetic. Storylines centered around acid-tongued modeling executive Racine who held fief over the careers of young models Laurie Caswell and Taryn Blake and cosmetics tycoon Grant Harper.
