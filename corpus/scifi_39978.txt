A low-fi grimy VHS edited in-camera apocalyptic feature finalizes the cycle. Two of the actresses from the first video remain but now are joined by a supporting cast of public access outcasts. Using sculptures drawings paintings crude animations puppets and heavily self-conscious performance - the final piece attempts to string a through-line from the caves of Lascaux and the Gnosis to the DNA-mishap-mutants of the future.
