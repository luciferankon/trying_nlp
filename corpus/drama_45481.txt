The Beans are poor proud hated by all but alive in the sense that they struggle against their lot and support each other in time of trouble. Earlene lives across the street from the Bean's trailer and the view from her window is better than any daytime television soap opera; especially Beal Bean and especially Beal Bean shirtless. When Reuben Bean is sent to prison for resisting arrest for out-of-season deer hunting Beal takes up with Reuben's woman Roberta. He also has a child by Earlene with a triangle of sex complicated by poverty.
