Back in 2004 George W. Bush needed help. He was a radical and he needed moderates. He was a master of dishonesty and he needed credibility. He was running against a war hero and he needed a warrior. So John McCain hugged him. Since then John McCain has embraced Bush's radical policy agenda completely. And for four years he's held on to his president tightly. Third Term is a documentary that looks at John McCain's policies and shows how they are just like George Bush's.
