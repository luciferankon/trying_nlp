The performance here is both in the face and the body as Terry Notary who plays Rocket takes us through practice to shooting. He talks about how demanding this actually is from the physicality to mannerisms and culture and that was just the six-week training. We also get to meet and see the entire ape team here. It was interesting to see those arm extensions they all use in their performances and what they are used for. Jason Chu walks us through some of the stunts here too. Finally we also get to meet Karin Konoval who plays the lovable the orangutan Maurice. She said she based the character on three real orangutans.
