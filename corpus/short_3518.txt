Foxy Grandpa and Polly was a comic strip upon which husband and wife team Joseph Hart and Carrie DeMar based a musical for the stage. Here they enter from our left hand in hand a sylvan backdrop behind them. They're in fancy dress: he in three-piece suit and tie bowler hat in hand; she in frilly floor-length dress hat and long braid of hair behind. They do a carefully choreographed dance - he's comic with large nose and male-pattern baldness splitting white curly hair; she's festive and smiling. They stay in sync. The camera is stationary and it's one take.
