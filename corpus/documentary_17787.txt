Told through their video correspondence The Things We keep offers an unusual amusing and heart-breaking vision of the major struggles of the last decade: Middle-East conflict migrant crisis and economic turmoil. Casey has been sending footage from around the world to his friend Ale for 12 years. Horrific and hilarious moments from his reports too unconventional for the news he makes for Al Jazeera have all ended up with Ale. Through Casey's eyes he discovers that behind the labels of 'islamist' 'immigrant' 'the poor' are people with their own names and aspirations.
