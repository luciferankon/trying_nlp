In is an essay about a beautiful and very intense but broken love relationship of two people. Its about how to deal with the other person after seeing each other again after many years of the break up. What happens in the head of each one? Are there still memories after years of silence since the silence has killed the love? What comes up in the mind when seeing the once beloved person after the time has healed all wounds. Does this person still feels familiar? Is there still a relation in any way? Is there still grief or anger? Apathy? Regrets? Or appreciation? In is taking a very interpersonal and sensitive look into those questions. Because the only way out is in.
