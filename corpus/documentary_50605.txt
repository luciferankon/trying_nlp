Do Not Enter is a thought-provoking and entertaining investigation of the far-reaching historic effects of the 1952 McCarran Walter Act largely repealed in 1991-repealed with the help of this documentary. The Act had been used to bar 250000 foreigners from entering the U.S. on political grounds. The USA Patriot Act has revived much of the McCarthy era law whose impact on free speech and foreign policy is the focus of "Do Not Enter." Exclusive interviews with prominent cultural and political figures amplify the legacy of this Cold War law and its blockade of democracy's free flow of ideas. The filmmakers traveled to twelve countries to interview people invited to speak or participate in U.S. cultural activities to learn why they had been denied U.S. visas and what they might have told Americans if allowed to enter the U.S. "A bold indignant documentary." -Newsday "An excellent resource for classes." -Journal of American History "This outstanding video should be seen by every educator who believes in academic freedom. Also suitable for college students it could easily be used as the basis for discussing what if any limits should be imposed on free speech. "Those who would dismiss U.S. restrictions by suggesting that foreigners need not be granted First Amendment rights might well examine the flip side that is the possible infringement of U.S. citizens' rights to hear opposing opinions. Four Gold Stars." -Teaching Equity Journal
