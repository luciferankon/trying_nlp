For many years people believed in the legend of the little Sandman a small man who gave children wonderful dreams through his sand. But in fact the Sandman is a 3000-year-old demon lord of the dream world who sneaks into people's dreams to steal their souls. In 1047 a monk gave his life to capture the Sandman within his eternal dreams. The Sandman caught since that day in a dead man's dreams had been forgotten and turned into a mythical figure during the Middle Ages. The blood-red Sandman escaped the eternal dream nearly 1000 years later. Not much longer and he began leaving a trail of dead bodies. Only very few people know of the crimson Sandman and only one will stand in his way.
