Hosted by Evette Rios chefs Richard Rosendale and Vikki Krinsky compete to help rehabilitate America's favorite recipes and inspire children and their families to make healthy lifestyle choices. Each episode will take a real family's favorite decadent dish such as fried chicken macaroni and cheese or nachos and challenge chefs to create a lower-calorie healthier version of the dish to be analyzed by Recipe Rehab nutritionists. Once the burners have been turned off and the dishes plated the family becomes the judge as they cast their votes based on how the new healthier recipes taste and how easy they are to make declaring which rehabbed dish and chef will win each week.
