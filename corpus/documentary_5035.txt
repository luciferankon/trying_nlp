The stark phrase 'Missing In Action' leaves the human spirit room for hope doubt and question. While it seems that Dr. Scannon's work is in a far remote piece of the world the real adventure and spirit is in bringing answers to the families of those missing all these years. They bravely served their country during some of the most brutal battles of World War II so we could have the freedom we enjoy today. However in an instant they were lost to their families forever. For more than 60 years the whereabouts of these fallen heroes remained a mystery until now. More than 200 aircraft plunged onto and around the islands of Palau during WWII battle with nearly half of their crew still listed as Missing in Action (MIA) today. "Last Flight Home" follows Dr. Patrick Scannon and his team of volunteers as they search the waters and jungles of Palau attempting to locate information that can lead to the identification and recovery of remains of these American MIAs. Palau is a group of islands in the far western Pacific Ocean including the militarily strategic island of Peleliu which was caught in three Pacific Theater battles including Operation Desecrate One Operation Snapshot and the Battle of Peleliu (codenamed Operation Stalemate II). The battles of Palau fought between the U.S. and Japan during the War in the Pacific have been largely ignored by history eclipsed by the more famous Iwo Jima Kwajelein and Okinawa. Join Scannon and his team who have found numerous aircraft such as Corsairs Avengers Hellcats and B-24s during their expeditions and who tirelessly search for answers as a way of thanking the MIAs and their families for the sacrifices made decades ago.
