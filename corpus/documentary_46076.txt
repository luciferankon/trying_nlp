This first story in a seven part series covers almost twenty years of history. It is a story of escalating violence and repression one nation on a collision course with the rest of the world. When the United Nations adopts the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 South Africa marches in the opposite direction and begins to implement a series of laws segregating its people by race in every aspect of life prompting the non-white majority led by the ANC to protest. The non-violent movement picks up supporters all over the world starting first with a network of Gandhites in Britain Sweden and the United States. But Apartheid hardens in the face of this resistance. By the fateful year of 1964 Nelson Mandela is jailed for life and the entire leadership is forced underground imprisoned or killed. The movement is effectively shut down in South Africa as hundreds escape into exile.
