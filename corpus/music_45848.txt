On June 21 1980 the Beach Boys original lineup took to the stage at Knebworth England for what would become their final concert together in the U.K. Largely uninspiring this performance represents the Beach Boys' surrender after a decade of terrible record sales of their original 70's material and a resurgence in interest in their pre-1967 material. Absent to fans are numerous masterpieces from the late '60's and '70's most noticeably anything from from Sunflower. Endless Harmony (documentary) and the Brian Wilson Tribute are much better DVD's. Hopefully future DVD releases will include better performances such as the 1973 tour or Brian' Live from the Roxy.
