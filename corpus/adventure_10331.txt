The film is a comedy that centers on a disgruntled 18th century Bostonian played by Errol who while wishing that he was a pirate dons the clothes and play-acts the part. He is mistaken for the real pirate Dixie Bull (played by Walter Law) whom Errol of course bumps into later in the film. More importantly Errol "slays" the villain and puts his foot upon the pirate's head. This is more than enough and he heads back home to his unappreciated wife played by Dorothy Gish. The henpecked Boston tailor of the 1750's Tremble-at-Evil Tidd is ridiculed by his neighbors for his timidity. He dreams of being a pirate on the Spanish Main; one night he dresses up as a pirate scaring his wife Betsy and alarming the neighbors. Tidd hides out in a rowboat where he is mistaken by buccaneers for Dixie Bull a notorious pirate. Tidd takes command of the pirate vessel where he finds Scute and other neighbors who have joined the crew to seek their fortune; because of his disguise however they do not recognize him. He defeats a British frigate and for the first time in his life he asserts himself and has the captured women turned over to him. In an attack on a small town Tidd captures the real Dixie Bull and becomes a hero in the eyes of all Boston and especially his wife.
