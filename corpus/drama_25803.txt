The apocalyptic narrative mosaic Quack au Fin is like a diorama. If you look in that box you can see the inhabitants of the typical dutch village do their shopping go to the Chinese restaurant take a dip in the harbor. All very normal. But why they react so overheated they make those crazy antics and do things you never expected them to do? They do not talk about it. What is it that hangs over their heads and rumbles beneath their feet?
