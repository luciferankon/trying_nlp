Pat Black is a late twenties boxer produced by the streets of the Bronx. When his father dies he spends his time finding community in all the wrong places. It isn't until his friends land him in a jail cell before he finally realizes his mistakes. Fortunately the connections that Pat made on the outside deliver him from prison and give him a chance to re-evaluate his life.
