A masked man is standing in front of a abandoned building. This man has chosen not to believe in God and is dead because of this. We are then shown numerous images that represent despair (collapsed buildings chickens caged up a dead squirrel man-like sculpture hung over a quarry). The film ends with a white-faced mask being swallowed up in the darkness surrounding the mask.
