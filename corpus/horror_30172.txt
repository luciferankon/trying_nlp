An entomologist (Michael J. Vogelsang) is enjoying the seclusion that he needs as he researches a new species of insect. While away the strains of family life start to pull at him. His problems are compounded when his benefactor voices some concerns regarding the direction of the insect research that he is doing. Lastly things take an even darker turn when he starts being eaten alive by a mass of fleas. Taking matters into his own hands the entomologist decides that the only way to combat everything is to cut the flea bites from his skin... and then amputate his leg. An entomologist (Michael J.
