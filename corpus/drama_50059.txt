Fran√ßoise Barnier the film's heroine is a mother. One day she stole something. She was in dire straits but no more so than usual. She was not in debt. She had always refused the degradation of excessive debt and charities attempting to live in line with the rules laid down by society and the law. We follow her journey through the judicial institution. Here two ideas of justice and law collide.
