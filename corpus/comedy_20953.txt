Factory Accident Sex is a sampler of Minneapolis comedian / personality / malcontent Rich Kronfeld's best material. Rich has been more widely known as Wally Hotvedt co host of Comedy Central's Let's Bowl or as twitchy industrialist Dr. Sphincter. This is a view into the life of a warped unemployable comedy mind. This menu driven DVD offers a hilarious look at some of Rich's finer comic moments. It is written and produced by Minneapolis comedy writers whose projects include Let's Bowl and Mystery Science Theater 3000.
