In August of 2011 Tropical Storm Irene ripped through the Adirondack Mountains of Northern New York upending lives and communities and reminding us of the ecological foundation of our economic well-being. Irene was a wake-up call exposing vulnerabilities of inland communities and sounding a call to action. In the aftermath of the storm a group of high school students take us on a journey through the region to meet local leaders and innovators. Cody Bary Erin Weaver and Gina Fiorile serve as our guides to understanding both short-term strategies to adapt to extreme weather and long-term solutions to excessive carbon emissions. The Resilient Ones explores the complex social transitions necessary to navigate this new era in human history. In 2015 "The Resilient Ones: A Generation Takes On Climate Change" was nominated for Best Documentary at the New England Emmy Awards and won Best Feature at the Colorado Environmental Film Festival.
