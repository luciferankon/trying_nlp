A silly quirky PG-Rated "Arthur" meets "Pretty Woman" romantic comedy with Roger (Keeffe Griffith) the fun diaper-loving investment banker who just wants to find his "Mommy"; Tina (Ming Ballard) the beautiful high-class EurAsian prostitute with Daddy issues; and Brad (Steven Bauer from Scarface) the cold-hearted lawyer who once loved Tina and wants her back... almost as much as he wants to ruin Roger.
