Two guys sit in their Hollywood apartment discussing ordering a pizza. One wants sausage one wants pepperoni. They flip a coin which rolls out the door down the stair and through the streets. The men give chase. After they lose the coin when it falls through a grate they settle for tacos; but when the coin suddenly rolls past they run after it. It finally comes to rest deep in Griffith Park with the sun beating down. What will it be?
