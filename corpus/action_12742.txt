Azita a young Iranian student studying in the United States receives a cell phone smuggled out of Iran. She is horrified when she sees a video on the phone capturing snipers shooting into a crowded anti-government demonstration...and her sister in the middle of the demonstration being killed by a gunshot wound to the head. When Azita learns that people have been murdered getting the phone out of Iran to her and that Tehran has built an impregnable firewall to stop all internet video uploads finding their way to the outside world she vows to bring it down. She enlists the help of Cyrus Reza a fellow student a young computer genius who is in fact the relative of the deposed Shah of Iran. Together the two students set up code-writing cells in cities across Europe and the US with the aim of creating a virus that will pierce Tehran's firewall and set the truth free.
