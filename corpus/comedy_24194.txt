A mockumentary about garage sales and the people who are obsessed by them. Bogwood Washington is a pleasant suburban community with a special distinction -- it has more garages per capita than any other town in America. Not surprisingly Bogwood is also the "Garage Sale Capital of the U.S.A." When retirees Doris & Clayton Fenwick decide to empty their nest of retro-modern antiques they set the wheels in motion for a frantically funny "g-sale" involving Bogwood's most avid garage sale junkies: Angela Cocci (an obsessive market researcher) Ed LaSalle (a beleaguered computer programmer and creator of the cult fantasy role-playing game "Caves & Beasts") Dick Nickerson (a retired star of the 60s sitcom "Pot o' Gold") and BJ Harwood & Helen Ziegler (partners and owners of a trendy retro-modern antique store). They try to outmaneuver each other to score their ultimate garage sale treasure: an antique board game worth a fortune. But who will end up with the prize...?
