Out of work stuntmen who hate each other are hired to perform in a cheesy live action show at a new theme park in Dubai. But on opening day real villains take the assembled VIPs -- and stunt guys' loved ones -- hostage for the biggest ransom demand ever made so the rival daredevils must put aside their differences and use their old school skills to defeat the high tech bad guys. In "Stunt Guys" rival stuntmen who hate each other are recruited for a live action show at the new Thrill Island park in Dubai: One white one black an Asian and a Muslim are "United!" to fight evil forces. But mercenaries replace the fake Ninja Assassins in the show on opening day and hold the world's richest men and U.S. President for the biggest ransom demand ever made. So the bickering stuntmen have to put aside their differences to rescue the hostages - who include their own families. Here's the twist though: Turns out the mercenaries are actors hired by the owner of Thrill Island because he needs the ransom money to keep his theme park dream alive after oil prices plunge worldwide. No one is supposed to get hurt since they're using non-lethal weapons. However a disgruntled actor/fake mercenary tired of playing Middle Eastern bad guys goes rogue and double-crosses the owner taking him hostage too with the use of real weapons he and his men seize from the President's Secret Service detail and other armed security guards. In the end the Stunt Guys unite for real and use their old school stunt skills to defeat the high tech bad guys and save the day - setting up the sequel: "Stunt Girls" in a new Chinese theme park show.
