Concerned that the economy could collapse? Or that a natural disaster could wipe out our infrastructure? So is Frank and he is doing something about it! Believing that America has become too reliant on a crumbling foundation Frank is preparing his family for life "off the grid" admiring the way people lived in the 19th century. Like them he longs to become completely independent. So he is embarking on one project at a time hoping to prepare his family for the worst such as building a car that runs on wood in case gasoline supplies are interrupted becoming expert hunters when grocery stores are no longer in existence and making his own alcohol for barter when the dollar collapses. Frank does it all with determination intelligence and good humor. He'll need all that and more as he attempts to motivate a family that neither shares his fervor nor wishes to sacrifice the comforts and conveniences of 21st century life. In the series premiere- "A Hunting We Will Go"- we meet the Belcastro's as they set out on a journey to be a self-sufficient family. Frank wants the family to be able to hunt and kill their own food but not every one is on board. Starting with making their own weapons Frank and his son Adam really learn an appreciation for the hunt but wonder if they will succeed.
