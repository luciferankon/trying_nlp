Inspired by the book "The Skeleton Crew" by Deborah Halber and infused with the personal story of producer 'Wendy West (I)' (qv). The series follows the life of a thirty-year-old woman (Ola Serafin) who is forced by circumstances to leave her husband and London and return to her hometown of LÃ³dz. While driving her car one night she witnesses a dramatic situation which looks like suicide but which she finds highly suspicious. The police seem to be indifferent to the case. Desperate Ola looks for help on the Internet where she finds a group of amateur detectives that solve criminal cases the police are unable to.
