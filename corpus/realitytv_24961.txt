Three families and three designers are given three days to transform their quiet street into an all-out Holiday Block Party! Throw away your traditional ideas as our designers go outside the box with their creative takes of the holidays. Designer Antonio Ballatore creates a rockin' Christmas at his house. Design Star winner Meg Caswell takes on the challenge of combining Chanukah with Christmas at her house. Next newcomer Tracy Porter turns her home into a South American celebration. At the end of three festive and heartfelt days host Tanika Ray reveals our final designs along with a special surprise gift of her own that puts the "party" in our Holiday Block Party.
