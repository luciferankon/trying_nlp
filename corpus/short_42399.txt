The Greatness is another step in Yi Zhou's research on the boundaries between dreams and reality imagination and madness truth and lies and life after death. Inspired by Dante's the Divine Comedy Zhou's imaginary journey through the circles of hell purgatory and paradise appropriates specific images scenes and characters from her earlier work and places them in new and extraordinary environments. These juxtapositions and re-imaginations transform the artist's original reference and meaning into something completely new and different. In The Greatness and these new realities are given immediacy by the artist's manipulation of 3-D technology.
