During an event in WÃ¼rzburg GDR an attractive young woman meets with the newly-elected mayor and promptly shoots him. Through a series of flashbacks we learn that the woman is named Ruth Bodenheim and that she is Jewish. The man she shoots named Zwischenzahl was responsible for the murder and internment of her family during the Third Reich and her forced prostitution at a brothel in Poland. After the war the American military throws Zwischenzahl in prison thanks in part to Ruth's testimony. The American captain is sympathetic to Ruth and it looks like justice will be served but the captain's higher ups and local businessmen have different plans for Zwischenzahl and he is released from custody. Ruth wants to kill him but discovers that he has gone to America. She decides to put it all behind her and marries. She seems to be having a happy life until one day downtown she comes upon row after row of posters promoting Zwischenzahl's campaign for mayor. At that point she decides that the only way justice will ever be survived is if she takes matter into her own hands. She knows she will be arrested and she wants the opportunity to have her day in court but there are still those who want to bury the story.
