The Man Who Saved Ben-Hur explores my relationship with my 89-year old second cousin Johnny Alarimo at the end of his life. A charismatic loner Johnny spent a dazzling career behind the scenes in show business without never forming any lasting relationships. Destine to die that way the film is a subtle dance between a subject who wants to control his legacy and a filmmaker/family-member who simply wants to know him.
