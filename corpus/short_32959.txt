A portrait of underground labour which studies the three week migration of young Quebeckers as they head south of the border to New York to sell Canadian grown Christmas trees on the streets of Manhattan. Moody and beautifully shot this documentary captures the flavour of outsiders at the fringe of a feast or famine cycle.
