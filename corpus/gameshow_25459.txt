In "Shopping Spree" two teams each comprised of two players tried to guess a prize one of the players on each team chose beforehand which was hidden inside one of six on-stage "stores." If player #2 on the first team correctly guessed the prize player #1 picked on the first try they won the prize and moved on to the next "store" where the process was repeated; if player #2 made a wrong guess there were clues pinned (!) all over player #1 to help player #2. Shortly thereafter the second team played; whichever team amassed the most prizes in the least time won. The winning team then went on to play two more rounds the next of which (called "The Double-Up Derby") was similar to the first but the prize was now picked by a member of the studio audience and the dollar amounts were doubled. In the final round (the "Birthday Party") the team had to guess within one minute and fifteen seconds what items were identified with certain stars. If the team supplied all the right answers within that time limit they won either a cash award or the title prize and a vacation (which was determined by the results of the previous round).
