An emotionally abused teen foster-child Nikea is pursued by New Worlde henchmen. Their ruler Kefka wants the data stored inside Nikea. But Neolandian messengers have told Nikea to pick something up from the ruler and bring it to their worlde and that the entire continent's survival depends upon it. Nikea is horrified at the depth of Kefka's cruelty and depravity and experiences it first hand. All she can think is: How do I survive? How do I unlock the data? How do I unleash its power? Why was I chosen?
