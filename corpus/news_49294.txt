Media Matters looks at the standards practices and performance of the print and electronic news media. The New York Times said that "its straight-on knowledgeable approach to the contentious issue of how news is being delivered . . . is a welcome addition to the PBS lineup." Media Matters is a magazine-formatted series in the style of 60 Minutes. Each program consists of three ten-to-fifteen minute documentary pieces and "Tough Calls" a segment that contrasts how journalists and non-journalists would deal with difficult editorial choices.
