An homage piece with a significant nod towards the living sculpture-art of Gilbert and George that plays with conventional notions of gender. Featuring two unnamed androgynous figures on plinths in an art gallery they dance to the same tune that Gilbert and George used in their piece from the late 1960s in which they created the "bend-it" dance.
