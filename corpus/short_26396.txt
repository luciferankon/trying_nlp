The video tries to subvert the developer's hegemony. It is related to the issue of Hong Kong's housing problem. In Hong Kong most of the images in the real estate TV commercials are fake. They do not show the real apartments. Beautiful women palaces cruises and huge gardens are the usual images. There are images which suggest that one will have power after buying the product. For example you will be a boss or a commander. The scale of the products (buildings) is often enlarged to show they are unique and powerful. The luxury life is your dream life. You want to have a good family so you need a house. These kind of advertisements help build the myth that everyone should own a house. Many people spend more than half of their income to pay the mortgage and become the slave of their houses in Hong Kong. The video is like real estate advertisement in fact they are anti-advertisement. It used S.I. d√©tournement method to subvert the mainstream discourse and the mass media and support social justice.
