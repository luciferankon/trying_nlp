PRISSYTROOPERS places its emphasis on the environment and way of life of the local population who are engaged in the traditional and UN-commercialized aspects of Caribbean culture. Its aim is to promote these initiatives to visitors who are interested in this People & Culture oriented form of tourism regionally and internationally. The filming team visits the selected destinations to film interviews and examples of the cultural offerings and working life of the community giving a clear indication of the kind of hospitality accommodation and interaction that the visitor can expect. This type of exposure of smaller types of tour providers and businesses in the tourism sector will ideally spark the economic growth of these small communities.
