Takako is a struggling scriptwriter. With reason she lives in Tokyo without returning to her hometown for 30 years. One day she gets an email from an old high-school friend. The last year of high school comes to memory. The summer of 1983. Yes that era when there were no cellphones or PCs. Attracted by old Hollywood movies she frequently visited Kamomeza Cinema. She made an 8 mm film with her friends Midori and Erika and help from the people in the town. But even though they finished it they could not screen it in the end.
