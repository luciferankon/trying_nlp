Dateline # Austin TX. Barefoot Bobby Briggs the legendary running back for the Austin Steers was today sentenced to die for his role in the armed robbery/murder at a downtown Stop 'n Go convenience store... It's five years later and Bobby's appeals have all but run out and the Austin Steers are - once again - on the march to the Superbowl with a lock on the playoffs when their wide receiver has a season ending injury. With their playoff hopes in shambles the Governor of Texas controversially offers Bobby a furlough # from death row # to help rescue the Steers' post-season hopes and even play in the Superbowl. Death & Texas chronicles the bizarre story of Bobby Briggs whose pro-career was cut short when he was sentenced to die. Guided by implacable anti-death-penalty advocate Marshall Ledger Bobby plays the only card he has left # his undoubted prowess on the football field. The final days of his appeals to the courts and the Governor play out side-by-side with the Steers' Superbowl hopes. With his execution scheduled for the day after the big game it all comes down to a Hail Mary pass... Satirical funny and unashamedly political Death & Texas parodies the legal system that attempts to sanitize and legitimize the killing of its own citizens. Shot "faux verit√©" style the film examines the trial and its fairness and interviews all the key people in Bobby's life: his lawyers family the politicians judges and prosecutors; the victim's family and many more who determine Bobby's fate. Beyond interviews Death & Texas looks at life in the Texas correctional system peaks behind the scenes of pro-football and of course the man himself: Barefoot Bobby Briggs.
