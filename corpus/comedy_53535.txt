Mustafali is a man liberated from all ambitions living in Çökertme Cove keeping to his own life style. But due to the sickness of his father who had left him and his mother years ago he had to come to Istanbul. Mustafali's philosophy will perplex Istanbul a city that had been living happily with its own truths before Mustafali came along. Mustafali a man who is against money accumulation setting targets success and living like we won't die will be disputing everything we know to be true in this fun story. Since he does not see success as a reward he does not submit to the threat of failure. He questions life in international companies plaza offices secure apartment complexes university cafeterias and student houses. He tells us how to stand against the modern world a world that wants to sell us more things by creating a fear of the future. Mustafali calls out to the young people of the world: " I'm against young people being straightened out."
