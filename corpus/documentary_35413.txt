Artrip 1 or an ode to the eye is a Super8 film i made long time ago between 1998 and 2000. It is a visual diary on-the-road-doc capturing images of people animals landscapes and architecture in my trips beginning from the GÃ¼ell Park in Barcelona wandering around the Greek rural and urban landscapes and ending to the Fanar neighborhood of Istanbul. Music plays a preponderant role providing the film with the aspect of an extra large video clip as it helps the viewer catch up with the mesmerizing fast sequence change. There has been made no editing; all sequences are presented as shot. Artrip 1 has been projected at the 6th International Documentary Festival of Thessaloniki (2006) at the 3rd Biennale of Mediterranean Artists (Athens 2003) and at the Strange Screen Festival (Thessaloniki 2007).
