At the international magicians' festival in Carlsbad Richard shows a number of the famous magician Vili Brod who stayed in Carlsbad from 1926 to 1938. In these times the time went slowly and easily and the guests of the world-known spa did not want to know anything about the restless world outside the spa. Vili ('Jirí Hrzán' (qv)) and his partner Vilma ('Jana Brezková' (qv)) make their number Twelve exchanges - twelve springs - twelve cups - twelve roses every night in the hall of the Varieté Orfeus better and better. One night he fails in his show and both artists are fired.
