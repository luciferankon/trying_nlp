Having been reared and educated in America the son of an American pearl trader and a Hawaiian island princess knows nothing about life on his mother's island. He and Enid Benton are engaged and when word comes that he has lost his family fortune she informs him that she will not marry a poor man. In Honolulu Tom's uncle John Garvin tells him that there is a rich store of pearls hidden on his mother's island and the young man now the island's rightful king sails there immediately where he is warmly greeted by the natives. The beautiful Tahona falls in love with Tom and shows him where the pearls are hidden. He escapes from the angry islanders with the pearls but after his return to Honolulu Enid's cold manner and his own conscience effect a change in him and he soon catches a steamer back to the island. He and Tahona wed and rule the islanders as king and queen.
