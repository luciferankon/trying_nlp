The comedy series features teenager Fergus McPhail (and his irrationally optimistic alter-ego) stumbling from crisis to crisis - mostly of his own making. The stories chart a year in his life showcasing Fergus at home with his erratic family at school among friends at play and sometimes even having a win in the steeplechase of adolescence.
