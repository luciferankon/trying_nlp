This is another one of Path√©'s famous trick pictures which will prove a great success on account of the wonderful transformations which are so cleverly enacted that they leave the spectators spellbound. A conjurer appears upon the stage with a large box out of which he takes several glasses and a decanter. Placing the glasses on the table he fills them with water then passing his magic wand over them he causes the features of pretty women to appear within the glasses. Next there is a great transformation scene in which all the glasses disappear and we are confronted by a bevy of beautiful girls who dance and cut all sorts of amusing capers.
