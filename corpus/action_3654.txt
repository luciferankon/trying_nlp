The Circle of Honor is a secret fight club with members and fans all over the world. Its traditions of to-the-death fight matches date back to medieval China. The world champion Circle of Honor fighter holds the magical Wings of the Dragon swords until another comes along who is greater. Jackson Lee a modern day warrior a descendant of the bloodline from the original five Shao Lin warriors is caught between a past he can't change and a destiny he can't avoid. Over one thousand years ago Chinese Emperor "XUANZOG" from the "TANG DYNASTY" decreed that at every full moon the best warriors representing their respective families should meet in a fight to the death in "the Circle of Honor". To the victor the prize two swords "The Wings of the Dragon". Jackson Lee has held the swords for almost fifteen years. In that time Lee has grown weary of the killing and the cult that celebrates it and refuses any but annual championship bouts. The younger fighters want to beat him and so the question of scoring that once-a-year championship bout against Jackson Lee looms large in the minds of these very ambitious competitive killers. Many of the Circle of Honor fighters are professional hit met assassins soldiers of fortune military men and women while some are dentists and accountants. They all lead double lives because there is absolutely nothing legal about the Circle of Honor.
