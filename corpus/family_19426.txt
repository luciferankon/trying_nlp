In Spain they didn't just dub the original "Sesame Street" and then broadcast it. They combined it with new material made in Spain. "Barrio Sesamo" combines an original spanish episode with "Sesame Street" footage dubbed to spanish. This program has passed through three periods. In the first period which comes from 1979 to 1980 Caponata the spanish name for Big Bird lives in a street where all the neighbours are friends and live happily. Perezgil is Caponata's best friend. In the second period from 1983 to 1987 the most succesful in Spain Espinete is a big pink hedgehog that has a lot of friends in the street where he lives. His best friend is Don Pimpom. The third period the most recent one started around 1995 and I don't know the exact year when it finished. Here Blucky is the new main character and the single episode format of the two previous periods is changed by short sketches combined with Sesame Street footage. It never reached the same succes the Espinete period had and went away.
