Bathed by the Caribbean Sea and home to the second largest live coral reef in the world Roat√°n Honduras is at once a popular island paradise destination for foreign tourists and a paradoxical land of beauty and misery where it's own citizens cannot afford to meet their most basic needs. Brigade is a documentary about a group of Honduran doctors who are building their own sustainable health infrastructure to combat the country's dire lack of essential medical care. Through one surgeons's narration of his struggle to balance the freedoms and obligations that come with opportunity Brigade takes you behind the scenery to a common reality of the places we love to enjoy.
