Observing the life of a toddler boy Bilal who still needs a lot of care and his blind parents is fascinating yet uneasy and dangerous. Unlike their parents the kids are not blind. Bilal lives with his parents who do not need light. In his dark house he plays hide-and-seek and teases his younger brother (sometimes in a risky manner) and then breaks his arm. When he wants to "hide" from his parents he sneaks out and other various things happen. It is not that his parents leave the kids alone in fact they do their best. Capturing a young sighted boy unaware of cameras and his blind parents offers a sense of reality and rare moments of love and hope. Their everyday life may look cruel to viewers who can see but to them it is normal and natural. Bilal lives in hardship with his family in their own way and creates another life for himself.
