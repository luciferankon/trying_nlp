Degenerate Art is a true document of the art and culture of glass pipe-making. It is the first film to ever bring to light this invisible sub-culture in a comprehensive and well informed format. The film itself tells the story of the movement through the voices of the pipe makers themselves and the industry that surrounds them. "Degenerate Art" tells the story of glass pipe-making from Bob Snodgrass and the origins of the "color-changing" pipe to the radical emerging art movement it has become today. Despite federal laws and events like Operation Pipe dreams pipe makers are pioneering not only new techniques in working glass but have also created a whole new genre of American folk art. Between raw materials and glass working tools and consumer demand for glass pipes a huge multi-million dollar industry has formed around this taboo culture. The pieces not only reflect the artists making them they are a reaction to the status quo. The work itself challenges our right to free speech and expression as well as reflecting the nature of the people who make and collect the pieces. One of the last true underground scenes glass pipe art remains invisible to mainstream culture. "Degenerate Art" will be the first of its kind a historical instant cult classic documenting the golden era of the movement.
