Smartened up and wearing bowler hats three youths - Eman Oskar and Milda - drive up to the town hall registry office in the Cleopatra their antiquated Walter car just as their freshly married friend Petar comes out of the building with his wedding guests. Their congratulations or rather condolences make clear what they think of his "betrayal" since earlier they had all made a promise never to resign themselves to women. They later invite the apprentice gardener Pída to join the party but only after he makes a solemn promise that he will never give up his freedom for a girl. Milda the student is secretly smitten with Olina but has to hide his feelings. The holidays are approaching and the party ride off to the Orlík reservoir in their Cleopatra.
