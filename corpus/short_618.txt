Beauty is the tale of Jacob Zechariah a man haggard and beaten down by life but with a quelled sense of hope deep within him burning to get out. An envelope slides through his front door on it is scrawled three words: What is Beauty? This leads him on a journey to ask everyone he comes across what their idea of beauty is as he pieces together fragments of wisdom & hope to discover his own answer.
