Patrick Deuel is the world's heaviest man - almost 1100 pounds. This documentary opens with paramedics removing a wall of his house in Valentine Nebraska and transporting him six hours to a hospital where he spent months trying to lose weight to qualify for a gastric bypass operation. This documentary moves among (primarily) Patrick and two others who are morbidly obese and their loved ones neighbors and doctors. It examines how they got that way what made them that way and how they have succeeded and failed in their struggles to change.
