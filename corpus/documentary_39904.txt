For more than 30 years former government clerk Frantisek Krause has had an active interest in ornithology. He studies birds and protects them building birdhouses and trying to be as close to them as possible. He records birds with mathematical precision archives his records and carefully organizes all his information. Gogola's documentary portrait shows how Krause combines love for nature with a positivist respect for facts and logical thinking. This remarkable symbiosis is fleshed out and subtly ironized by the narration whose consciously exaggerated emphasis on minor facts subverts the conventional descriptive commentary we are used to hearing in traditional nature documentaries.
