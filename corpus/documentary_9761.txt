Winner of a Bronze Plaque at the 47th Annual Columbus International Film & Video Festival in 1999 this documentary profiles Cuban-American Dr. Magaly Lavendenz a college professor. Cultural identity is of special interest to producer Mario Congreve and director Glenn Gebhard who examine it here via Lavendenz's visit to Cuba -- her first since fleeing the island nation as a child in 1962. The program documents this emotional visit with friends and family and the effort by Lavendenz to reconcile herself to her exile.
