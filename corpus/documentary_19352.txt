His stage name refers to a port of the Colombian pacific named Buenaventura where Yuri Bedoya was born and raised a 46 years old mulatto who in spite of being rather short and thin says he is a 6 foot 7 inch black man deep down. Buenaventura was inhabited by Cimarrones free slaves; being born and raised there really scarred Yuri. The sounds of the drum marimba the cooing of black people in the seashore and the gray sky; the forest the Tunda and the Virgen del Carmen; the witchcraft and faith that are breathed there gave the hallmark with which you can recognize a musician from Buenaventura.
