A group of young party goers a gunshot victim and a detective hell bent on finding a designer drug that leads all three parties to an underground rave named "Habit" being held at an abandon lunatic asylum tucked away on the North Shore of Boston. Upon arriving at the rave plans drastically change as the group finds themselves chasing the electronic beats that quickly fade within the asylum and disappear into screams of their own worst nightmares. The institutionalized hallways and stairwells built to keep insanity captive separate the group into a spiral of horrifying murders or suicides separating nightmares from reality. In the end one persons craziness is the others reality.
