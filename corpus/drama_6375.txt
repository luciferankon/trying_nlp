The mayor of Filbert Ohio--a saloonkeeper named Schmidt--is a crook and a grafter. The local Civic Reform Society and the Prohibition Party ask him to a conference but during it he slips and hits his head on a heater knocking himself out. They think he's dead and when they find a drifter who looks just like the crooked Filbert they get him to assume the man's identity. As it turns out the real Mayor Schmidt isn't dead. Complications ensue.
