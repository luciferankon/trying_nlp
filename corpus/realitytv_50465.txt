As the world's most sold copyrighted book Guinness World Records has a world record of its own. This winter NBC is hoping to capitalize on the popularity of the book and the oddities within with its own Guinness World Records television special. Hosted by Brit star Fearne Cotton host of the UK show Top of the Pops Guinness will not only feature world records from the latest edition of the book (including longest fingernails smallest waist worlds tallest & shortest man etc.) but will also have a death-defying stunt performed live at the end of the show.
