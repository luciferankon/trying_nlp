In a plot similar to but predating the later Superman stories a young girl Jenny is involved in several dangerous adventures as a result of her possession of a valuable jewel. Each time she is saved by her normally shy unassuming boyfriend Audreses who comes to her rescue disguised as a bare-chested wrestler wearing a mask.
