On a field trip a young schoolteacher named Mary [Afsaneh Bayegan] tells the story Shangoul and Mangoul to the children: The lion as king of the jungle sets up a contest between the wolf and the fox where he will hire the one who brings him delicious food the soonest. The wolf and the fox kidnap the baby goats (Shangoul Mangoul and Grape). The wolf decides to eat Shangoul and Mangoul himself but the fox takes Grape to the lion. The mother goat goes looking for her children and she and other the animals of the forest restrain the wolf and the fox; the baby goats are returned to their mother safe and sound.
