The newest comedy series that portrays the lifestyle of rising actors that get sucked into "background extra" work to get behind the scenes. Literally. Three strangers meet on a film set. They have one destination. Friendship develops. Personalities clash. The transition from extras to starring actors builds with momentum. Or does it? You have MO a cranky and sarcastic Middle Eastern who looks like a Puerto-Rican. TONY is an airhead and overly confident Guido who has a slight drinking problem. Lastly you have the comical and ridiculous Black dude who happens to be the Rookie of the three DEVON. You've seen Entourage. Now you will see the REALITY of what Actors struggle through to make their dreams happen. The highs and lows of the entertainment industry are enough to make you laugh and cry at the same time. "RUSH CALL for extras... ARE YOU AVAILABLE TODAY?"
