Everyone's loneliness is a maze and each relationship is a thread....that's why it takes two to get out of the maze. The lives of nine kids slides thinly from normality to confront a world of dreams but also of sacrifice and dedication. Lucrezia's courage against her Mother's will at such a young age to hold on to the child when she discovers herself pregnant. Diamante in her isolation would prefer "a slap in the face" with fury than the caresses that hide something else. Chicco discovering what the "real" world really is. Crisscrossing stories never easy and never obvious as the world we live in proves to be. When dreams seem like they are ending when words aren't enough: music dance and the discovery of Minosse comes to the rescue as fast as a heartbeat of life provoking new ways possible to continue. No idealism here no rhetoric "Fame" in this approach to cinema by Heather Parisi.
