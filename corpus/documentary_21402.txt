In 1957 Ron Manolio and his suburban Cleveland family saved a year's worth of eggshells painted them and placed them on their lawn for Easter morning passersby to enjoy. The attention generated by that not-so-simple act would change the lives of a family a community and thousands of strangers. "Eggshelland" is the story of Ron and Betty Manolio and their unique 52-year family tradition - an inspiring colorful quirky and poignant display of art and obsession. Transforming their front yard into a childlike dreamworld of color fantasy and creativity the Manolios have brought joy to generations of Midwesterners waking from a long gray winter. But "Eggshelland" is more than a suburban lawn display. It's a beautiful funny strange and emotional story of the many lives that have been touched the never-ending joy of childhood in the Spring and the resounding contentment of a life well lived.
