Philip Eaton is a passenger in a Pullman sleeping car headed to Chicago. However he's not quite what he seems to be--he's actually Hugh Overton who has just escaped from prison to clear himself after having been falsely convicted of murdering Matthew Latrone a corrupt financier who cheated Hugh's mother out of her estate. It turns out that Latrone is still alive and sends out a killer to eliminate Hugh. Complications ensue.
