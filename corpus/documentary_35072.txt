This sequel revisits Isozaki at the successful completion of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 1988 and accompanies him to commissions for private residences. These are: a museum an art center and a concert hall in Japan; a large nightclub in New York; an administration building for Disney in Orlando; and the Olympic Sports Palace in Barcelona. Isozaki continues to pursue an independent path balancing architectural ideas of the past with the hyper-technology of the present.
