A girl and her brother who need to travel to their hometown some five hours from Tehran get a ride with a taxi driver who happens to be a mullah. On the way they pick up another woman with who has a baby. In the course of conversation we learn that the girl worked as a nurse for an old man who had attempted to have a relationship with her an advance that she rebuffed. Oddly enough the mullah believes her while her brother fully aware of the old man's wealth wants her to turn back. Appearances can be deceiving.
