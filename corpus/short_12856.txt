It's a wet summer day on upstate New York's Route 90. A serial killer is loose from the local penitentiary. A hymn-singing grandma picks up a shadow-boxing hitchhiker (she's Helen he's John Thomas). She offers him a ride to the end of the road where Route 90 hits the Interstate. He jumps in. They chat: he's headed out of state; he's been "involved with law" but "needs to you know get away." She turns on the radio and he observes that music calms the savage beast. He's carrying a large knife and asks her to pull over so he can answer nature's call. He's back quickly inviting her to see a beautiful sylvan scene just off the road out of sight. Will she follow? What lies in store?
