Two young lesbians living together have what they consider the perfect life--good jobs nice apartment and their sex life is satisfying. One day one of the girls' former boyfriends shows up a soldier who has just returned from an overseas tour. The girls decide to try one more time to see if they can be sexually satisfied by a man and it turns into a competition to see who can bed him first and how far each one will go once they do.
