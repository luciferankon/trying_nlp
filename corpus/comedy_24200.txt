A ragtag group of store clerks get stuck working until midnight on Christmas Eve at Xmas-O-Rama a shabby Christmas shop in a blue-collar New Jersey town. The store is run by Mike Malcolm a shady degenerate gambler whose debts suddenly catch up with him in the form of two thugs who have come to collect what they are owed. Mike flees to the nearest card game to try and win enough money to keep his "creditors" from breaking his legs or worse. Alone in the store on this busy night of quirky last minute shoppers the diverse mostly non-Christian employees struggle with their "outsider" relationship to Christmas. While waiting for Mike's return and more importantly their paychecks the eccentric group reveal their individual religious pride misunderstanding jealousy and secret love for the spirit of ever-present Christmas.
