Each winter Tub hunts with childhood friends Frank and Kenny. Approaching middle age and still the butt of every joke Tub wants this year to be different. And it is: deep inside a snow-covered forest his long-buried aggression comes raging to the surface. Based on the Tobias Wolff short story 'Hunters in the Snow'.
