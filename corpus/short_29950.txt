Sam Jinks' sculptural work sustains the briefest and often most private moments in time. Emotional vulnerability is both the subject and result of his work and moves audiences in a way not expected from contemporary art. For Jinks his works are not literal representations but are based on the combination of different stages of life. Jinks uses these themes of old and new to suggest unrealized potential: the figures are frozen in time simultaneously at the beginning and end of life. This can be interpreted either as a melancholy reflection of loss or as the experience of generations standing together with the awareness of life cycles and different stages of development. His hyper-real sculptures have been described as 'poignantly beautiful' as his works create a dialogue on both a technical and emotional level through a strong sensitivity to detail. Created from silicone fiberglass resin calcium carbonate and human hair these works contain a profound sense of the vulnerability and are remarkable in their striking portrayal of the human condition. Jinks' work can be found in various public collections that include: McClelland Gallery + Sculpture Park Victoria Australia Shepparton Art Gallery Victoria Australia The Kiran Nader Museum of Art Dehli  Indian and the Museo Escultura Figurativa Internacional Contemporaenea (MEFIC) Portugal in addition to various private collections within Australia and internationally.
