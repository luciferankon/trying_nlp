Every year thousands of Americans are involved in the drug trade. Buying selling and ultimately using. Drugs are a force to be reckoned with like a pack of wolves waiting to tear your life and family apart. Addicts will lie cheat and steal. They will sell out their best friend for a psychological effect that numbs their bodies and destroys their minds. Drugs are slowly rotting away the underbelly of American Society. Optimistic teens turn into strung out neurotic fiends unable to cope with reality. People throw their lives away like pieces of trash and the AMERICAN CITY STREETS are littered with it. For them there may be hope.. These are their lives this is their story.
