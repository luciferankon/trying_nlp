Francisco Romero alias "El Pairo" is in prison since more than 20 years and he could not even see the death of his own father. Interestingly the place where he could leave drugs was the prison itself and every day he shares experiences with young prisoners who unfortunately have followed his same lifestyle. Other prisoners which destiny make them commit various errors that now pay with their freedom tell us their life behind the prison's walls; they talk about their daily work in the laundry their hours of sport or helping in the infirmary all activities that make the time pass by more quickly and with dignity. The families of the prisoners who suffer in silence are visiting their beloved ones from the other side of the "glass" to recall stories and dream of freedom. Some see their children growing behind prison bars others have not seen anybody since they are in prison and others are left singing alone to forget their past and their present. The repentance of every prisoners and by remembering the reason for their current situation leave us a positive message which is suitable for all viewer's opinion.
