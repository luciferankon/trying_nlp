Their ideological differences personal experiences and upbringings brought them to a monumental turning point in their lives-the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC) and 1977 International Women's Year National Women's Convention. As chosen delegates from the states of Illinois California and Texas these women formed the NWPC Chicana Caucus -representing Latina sisters across the nation and working towards liberation.
