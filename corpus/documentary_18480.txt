If Switzerland is sometimes perceived as heaven on earth the question that follows is: do its inhabitants believe in heaven? Believers agnostics and atheists all feel the need for a narrative when confronting death. So what is left of paradise which once promised eternal happiness? Encountering people in the twilight of their years this film offers a moving offbeat and personal quest within the depictions of this place common to all of humanity faced with hope and shared doubt.
