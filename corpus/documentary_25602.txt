The film reveals the incredible and varied human stories of the passengers involved and the terror and exhilaration that accompany a near-death experience. On 15 January 2009 155 people on board US Airways flight 1549 faced their worst nightmare. Just two minutes into the flight a flock of birds struck the plane taking out both engines. With no power Captain Chesley Sullenberger decided he had only one option: to land in the Hudson River. Miracle on the Hudson tells the minute-by-minute story of that day through the compelling first-hand testimonies of those who were there including passengers eyewitnesses and rescuers with exclusive interviews and videos.
