Ben just can't figure out what's happening to him. Things just don't make any sense. Who is this stranger that looks like him? Why did someone search his apartment? Is somebody following him? Do they want him or someone else? And most importantly who can he trust? His friends? His roommate? His ex-girlfriend? The more Ben finds out the deeper he digs the more confusing everything gets. Every answer raises a new question.
