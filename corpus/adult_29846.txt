A high-school football team is scheduled for a game against an undefeated team from another school and the team's coach is sure that his team will lose to the undefeated team. His daughter comes up with a plan to make sure that her dad's team will win: she and several of her girlfriends will have sex with the members of the opposing team resulting in their being so exhausted by game day that they'll be too tired to win.
