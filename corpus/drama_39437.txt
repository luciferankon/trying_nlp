In the military Garrison is the collective term for the body of troops stationed in a particular location originally to guard it but now often simply using it as a home base. A military mystery Garrison revolves around an A.W.O.L soldier who is being searched for by his fellow troops. Garrison was inspired by the Fort Bragg killings of 2002.
