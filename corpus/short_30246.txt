In a nod to gangster films of the last century this campy and stylish comedy sees the return of the world's best queer duo for their third adventure. This time having been forced into a life of crime by ultra-conservatives the infamous Jonny Pimp and Honey Ho are back to protect gorgeousness from the waspy Christian Wright and Crystal Cathedral.
