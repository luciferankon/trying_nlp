Two contestants compete through three types of rounds. In the letters rounds they use nine randomly drawn letters to form the longest word possible. In the numbers rounds they must use arithmetic to combine six randomly drawn numbers and get as close to a random three-digit target number as possible. Finally in the Conundrum round they must rearrange a set of words totaling nine letters to form a single word. Contestants stay on the show until they either lose a game or retire undefeated as an "Octochamp" after eight wins. At the end of each series the top eight players are invited back to compete for a prize package that includes a set of dictionaries.
