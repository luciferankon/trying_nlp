The Oaks Cricket Club is a shining light in an otherwise dark world of inequality. Impoverished kids aged between 14 and 19 from The Oaks village in wild Limpopo province who love the game of cricket and play it daily despite the massive obstacles and challenges they face. Niel van Deventer multiple SAFTA winning filmmaker and poet and journalist Kabous Verwoed became involved in organizing help for the club. The original idea was to just make a short 10min documentary segment and use that to get help and or sponsorship for the club. After the first weekend of shooting however Van Deventer and Verwoed realized they had something more important in their hands. A few more self financed shooting weekends followed until they had enough footage to edit together a short teaser. Their help in raising awareness about this club drew the attention of local business folks and things have since started to change. The first delivery of cricket equipment has already taken place with more to follow. A local citrus exporter has committed to build the club their own practice facilities and cricket field and plans are afoot to take the kids on their first ever tour. The planned tour's destination will be the Eastern Cape. Imagine that the coach and the entire team will see the ocean for the first time together. In a time where very few good news stories are told in South Africa The Oaks: Field of Dreams promises hope and a better future for all built on a simple (but strong) foundation of brotherly love friendship and involvement. Help us show the world how circumstances can be changed through active involvement. Help us tell the world this truly remarkable story of hope development and cricket.
