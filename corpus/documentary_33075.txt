Born in Mexico he became the main family provider when his father died in an accident. So began the story of a man who had a "thousand jobs" before acting in a film of Cecil B. DeMille - and who within weeks had married the great director's daughter. After being stereotyped in countless roles as Mexican bandits Indian warriors Oriental villains and Arab princes he confounded Hollywood by turning his back on a career as character actor. Instead by going his own way he became an internationally acclaimed Academy Award-winning star. Here is the Mighty Quinn with his own on-camera narration and comments of actors Julie Harris Tony Franciosa Gina Lollobrigida Giulietta Masina Giancarlo Giannini directors Federico Fellini Martin Ritt J. Lee Thompson Stanley Kramer and children Valentina and Lorenzo. Clips come from La Strada Lust For Life Lawrence Of Arabia Requiem For A Heavyweight Blood And Sand Viva Zapata The Guns Of Navarone Wild Is The Wind The Black Orchid Walk In The Spring Rain and of course Zorba The Greek.
