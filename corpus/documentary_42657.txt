The film offers a unique insight into the world of Giger's creation and his private life. In addition to the interview with the artist himself a considerable part of the documentary is formed by interviews with personalities such as Ernst Fuchs Stanislav Grof and Debbie Harry. Though the authors do not avoid particular developmental periods of Giger's work the main purpose was not to create the artist's biography. In this case it is more likely considered to be an authentic perspective on the peculiar world of this Swiss surrealist artist.
