'She' follows Tanesh Nutall a 50-year old black transgender woman from Rahway New Jersey. In February 2016 Tanesh was confronted by a city employee for using a women's restroom in Downtown San Francisco. Throughout the film Tanesh seeks justice and make amends with family members that were not accepting of her sexuality. Not only does 'She' discuss queer people in urban spaces but one's ability to accept themselves despite the odds against them.
