Director and Writer Eric Dow ("Honor in the Valley of Tears") brings us his second documentary as he goes behind the scenes of the fan fiction short film "Batman: Dead End." In the winter of 2003 commercial director Sandy Collora and some of his friends set out to make a low-budget short film for his demo reel. What they wound up actually doing was making one of the most elaborate most watched most talked about and most controversial short films ever made: Batman Dead End. Considering the amount of press and admiration Batman: Dead End garnered everybody expected it to quickly propel director Sandy Collora into the Hollywood stratosphere but instead his career failed to launch. Now we get the inside look at the legend of the superhero and the people who help create it including Collora comic book legend Neal Adams and convention all stars Sean Clark Shawn Reeves and Jordu Schell. Behind The Mask: The Batman Dead End Story is an incisive look at the making of the short film and what it takes to make it as a Hollywood A-lister.
