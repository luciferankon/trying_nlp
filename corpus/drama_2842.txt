An inner-city teenager gets in trouble at school and is forced to serve detention in the ballroom dance club. To his surprise he discovers that he loves to dance but he must overcome a family tragedy and the ridicule of his friends before he can bring the rhythms of the street into the ballroom and express his own unique style. (It's like a Latino BILLY ELLIOT set in high school.)
