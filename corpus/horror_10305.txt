In this horror anthology edited from older Full Moon releases three tales of terror are told. In "ASCENT FROM HELL" ('Dark Angel: The Ascent') an young demon female escapes Hell and comes to Earth where she becomes the punisher of sinners. "INFINITE EVIL" ('The Lurking Fear') a race of cannibalistic genetic creatures live below a cemetery and hunt humans for food. In EVIL NEVER DIES ('Talisman') the Black Angel is summoned from his resting place to bring about the end of the world.
