A man in a suit - a 'suityman' - wakes up firmly planted in a cornfield. He has no memory of who he is or why he's there and is hopelessly incapable of digging himself up. As he resigns himself to his predicament he hears a bicycle bell in the distance and is soon faced with apparently the only other person around. An enigmatic and eccentric fellow this bedraggled stranger introduces himself as the farmer of this land and after digging the suityman out promises to get him to the nearest train station. What follows is a day-long hike through the endless countryside to a station the suityman begins to suspect might not even exist but what fate awaits him if he goes it alone?
