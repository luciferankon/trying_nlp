THE LOPSIDED PEOPLE Edith Stephen Director THE LOPSIDED PEOPLE are lopsided because they are not balanced equally between the Right and Left Brain. Both sides of the brain have many elements to them but for the sake of simplicity we will call the LEFT BRAIN Money oriented and the RIGHT BRAIN Creativity and Art. We are fighting the imbalance of the Right and Left Brain and it can only be made more balanced by allowing opportunities for the Right Brain to develop more possibilities for creative endeavors more community more compassion and caring in the world.
