What happens when a man's worst nightmare becomes a reality? How should one react after discovering the last true love in his life has been taken away from him? Sometimes we must deal with these horrors in our own way outside the due process of our law enforcement system that may not give us the justice we crave. Thomas Malum a widow single father and former interrogator has only one mission - to provide for love and protect the only person left in his life-the one that matters most. His world is torn open when a child predator enters his home and violates his daughter leaving her dead. When he fears that the police won't provide the punishment he is hoping for Thomas reacts as only he has been trained to do. Right vs wrong good vs bad love vs hate all become more problematic in his race for justice. As Thomas's covert operation of interrogation and torture progress's he begins to question his own morality-has he become no different than the monster who took away his own daughter? "Dark of Light" is a feature length film in the vein of "Taken" "Law Abiding Citizen" and "The Equalizer." Filmed in the pristine Endless Mountains region of northeast Pennsylvania.
