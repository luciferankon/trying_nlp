Buster Baker halfway through a life of chronically failed get-rich schemes loses his boring desk job and gold digging wife. While checking his inevitably losing lottery tickets at a liquor store he notices the security camera and devises a way to win the lottery -- every time. He seeks the help of his closest friend an ex-hacker with mounting veterinary bills who reluctantly joins him out of his own sense of desperation. The perfect plan quickly spirals into chaos as his exploits are discovered by his soon to be ex-wife and her mobster lover as well as a young local reporter looking to make a name for herself.
