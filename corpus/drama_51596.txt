After a bad date on the outskirts of Moscow a young woman hitches a ride back to the city only to discover that the driver has bad intentions. She manages to get him to stop the car and flees from him into the woods. There she stumbles upon a little house where a man lives with his little daughter. "Moe lyubimoe chudovishche" is an interesting and modern take on the tale "Beauty and the Beast".
