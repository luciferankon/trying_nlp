In Crack Up we witness the transformative power of comedy. Comedian David Granirer a veteran stand-up comedy teacher has a niche market for his comedy classes - people with mental illness and he's coming to Australia to transform the lives of 10 comedy hopefuls. They'll be pushed beyond their limit over 12 weeks to deliver an outstanding comedy show to a sold-out audience at Edge Theatre in the heart of the Melbourne CBD. We follow 3 hopefuls on the journey to comedic greatness.
