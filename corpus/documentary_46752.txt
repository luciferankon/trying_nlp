Flashback dramatically unspools the science behind the long-standing controversy over "recovered memory" of child sexual abuse. Exclusive footage brings the social history of the hard-fought conflict to life as world-class renowned experts come together at key flashpoints over the years to passionately and eloquently spar over whether or not you can as Elizabeth Loftus challenges "be molested every night for a 10 year period and then totally repress it until it comes out in therapy 20 years later". Dramatic compelling evidence from emerging brain science and the moving engrossing stories from victims of child sexual abuse and lost memory both punctuate the story of the evolving evidence and bring it to a logically convincing conclusion.
