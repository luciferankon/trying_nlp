Fictions is a half-hour comedy series about the worst marketing and communication team at a multinational (and possibly evil) corporation Holter Industries. They're doing their dream job only it isn't everything they thought it would be. How do you make displacing a tribe sound good? What do you do with a GPS that threatens your life? What is that glowing thing in the box? It ISN'T Mad Men. It ISN'T glamorous. It's just life selling lies. FICTIONS isn't your father's comedy show though strangely it is your mother's comedy show. It's edgy irreverent sometimes surreal and always funny.
