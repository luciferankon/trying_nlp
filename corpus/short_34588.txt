After my mother died I was drawn to revisit all the places we went together when I was younger upon these visits everything appeared tainted what had been full of life and happy memories was empty and melancholic. I set about making a film that would express what I felt better than I could ever explain. All the people in the film are close family and friends who have played a key part in my growing up all the locations are places special to me and my mum.
