The video is hosted by the gifted historian and storyteller "Miss Betty" Ward. Spry and charming this "history-loving grandma" takes viewers to the places where history actually happened and tells the stories of the people involved - the famous the scandalous the forgotten. Miss Betty introduces us to fiery-blooded patriots rum-running sea captains the female stranger (a real ghost story) Capt. John Smith who discovered the deep water port brilliant black scientist Benjamin Banneker and Alexandria's most famous resident George Washington who kept a townhouse there and whose farm Mt. Vernon was just a few miles away.
