Charles Pellegrin 40-year-old country doctor buys a practice in Arles a provincial town near Marseille. In five years he has a large practice and a lovely (but more efficient than passionate) wife when he meets spectacularly sexy sensuous Martine who seduces him. Soon he's honoring that old French custom of keeping a mistress. At first Martine brings romance then passion into his life...then black jealously and despair.
