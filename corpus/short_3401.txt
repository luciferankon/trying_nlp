Composed of 4 pieces: In "Concepts" we find an introduction from visual effects supervisor Jim Mitchell and then watch material that covers "The Spinosaurus" "The Pteranodons" and "The Raptors". All three of those pieces provide comments from animation director Dan Taylor. In "The Process" after the introduction from Dan Taylor we get an interview with digital model supervisor Ken Bryan and we then watch some basic computer work along with more commentary from Bryan. Then we get an interview from lead animator Glen McIntosh and then shows us a piece which depicts the film before the CG creatures appear. Lastly we get an interview with lead animator John Zdankiewicz. In "Muscle Simulation" we find an introduction and comments from creature supervisor Tim McLaughlin and we then witness a Demonstration of the computer techniques with technical animation supervisor Dennis Turner. The last piece ends with "Compositing". In here we hear from compositing supervisor Eddie Pasquarello which tells us what the term means and show us these techniques in action.
