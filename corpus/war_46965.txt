The Rose of No Man's Land is a first world war drama that isn't about the war. It's about the people left behind. The women who were left to keep the country running and how they stepped up to do so. More importantly it's about women not allowing themselves to be defined by who they are perceived to be and where they come from. Traditionally war stories tell of the dramatic effect it has on the men fighting the war but the women are fighting injustice too. Men fighting and the horrors of the battlefield has been portrayed often and well but Rose has a fresh perspective and a unique story to tell. From Nurse Edith Cavell to the Loveless women; Maisie Florence and Dorothy The Rose of No Man's Land is about remarkable strong women who would not be oppressed without a fight.
