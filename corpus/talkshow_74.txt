Croatian linguist Snjezana Kordic ascertains that since 1990 purism and prescriptivism have been the main features of language policy in Croatia which is manifested among other things by replacing English words with Croatian substitutes. She does not approve this type of language politics. Kordic describes the language of Croats Serbs Bosniaks and Montenegrins as a pluricentric language with four standard variants spoken in Croatia Serbia Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. These variants do differ slightly as is the case with other pluricentric languages (e.g. English German French Portuguese Spanish) but not to a degree which would justify considering them as different languages. This fact suggests by no means a re-establishment of a common state since standard variants of all other polycentric languages are spoken in different countries e.g. English in the USA UK Australia and Canada German in Austria Germany and Switzerland.
