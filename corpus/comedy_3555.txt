A few bus-loads of holidaymakers from the agricultural cooperative on a day trip arrive to see the show at the Slavia Circus. But they have bad luck. It is Monday the day on which the employees have their extra day off. The only person that leader of the group Mr. Bláha ('Rudolf Hrusínský (V)' (qv)) finds in the empty circus is the stage manager Liska ('Jaroslav Marvan' (qv)) and the box-office girl Marie ('Irena Kacírková' (qv)). In a heated discussion Bláha proves to Liska that the holidaymakers have reserved and paid their tickets for that night three months ago. Unfortunately in the meantime the extra day off was moved from Friday to Monday. Nobody remembered that one Monday performance was already booked. After a shorter argument with Bláha Liska decides that the holidaymakers will have their show. He sends Maria to get the circus artists from all the different places around Prague - from the artists' exercising arena from their flats from the Lucerna Palace and even from the Central Hotel where one of the female artists is just getting married.
