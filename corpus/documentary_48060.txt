The British anthropologist Geoffrey Gorer said that death has become 'pornographic' to us an obscene content from which children must be kept safe. The first and the main western taboo. The western obsession about death has seen as an universal and permanent feature across both time and space: 'humankind fears death' and this has always been considered a fact. Trying to find an exception to this rule our story will occur between two worlds poles apart from Italy to the far end of austral Africa in Madagascar. This is the story of a world mirroring to ours in which death is not frightening funerals are the biggest parties and where the living and the dead speak laugh and dance all together.
