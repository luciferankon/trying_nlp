As a lesbian relationship falls apart this documentary unravels. The filmmaker sets out to record a momentous moment in a successful relationship. Through recording two women moving in together she had hoped to explore her sister's traditionally/hetero-normative beauty. But reality contests the filmmaker's high falutin' pre-production planning. As the relationship (and the film) fall apart the filmmaker reveals her personal reasons for her obsession with the subject at hand.
