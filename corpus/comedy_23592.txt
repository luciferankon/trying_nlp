This Belgian sitcom in French the title of which can be read as "happyness nearby or "- across" is about a kind motherly landlady madame Irčne and her boarders notably college students and somewhat mischievous (Robert especially) except top-marks but conceited Jean-Philippe Beaulieu who is the only one from an upper-class family. They live together in a hilarious succession of pranks misunderstandings jealousy accidents etcetera which often involve outsiders as well.
