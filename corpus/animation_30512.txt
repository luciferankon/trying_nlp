Young Tane Te Pania loves Christmas with all his heart but is disappointed every year when Santa inadvertently overlooks his town. Tane lives on Ngaro Island just below Stewart Island. It's a small secluded town self-sufficient off the map and pretty much completely off the radar. So far off the radar that it's not even included in weather forecasts. The Island is connected to the mainland by a single extension cord. Every year Tane celebrates Christmas to its fullest embracing the "movie-like" imagery of Christmas that he's always adored. He dresses like it is winter goes bob-sledding in make-believe snow and puts reindeer antlers on his dog Blitzen. When the mayor reveals that the mainland plans to turn off the power to the Island and relocate everyone Tane won't accept it and announces to his friends and family that this year Santa will come and save Ngaro Island. Now Tane needs to use every bit of his Kiwi ingenuity to make his town noticeable.
