A great intergenerational day out. A must-see film for anyone who grew up in Toronto or is interested in Toronto's Jewish history. This lovely and well-made documentary is the culmination of the JCC's Intergenerational Oral History Program. As part of their Grade 9 Jewish History class students from both CHAT and CHAR interviewed seniors about their memories of growing up in Toronto. These interviews form the basis of this documentary. A treasure trove of photographs supplied by the Ontario Jewish Archives brings these stories to life. Interviews with academics Cyril Troster and Dr. Jack Lipinsky provide historical background and context for the film.
