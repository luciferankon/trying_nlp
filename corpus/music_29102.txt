This evening of one-acts is like a lavish three-course dinner prepared by a master and promising something for everyone's taste. Not since 1952 had San Francisco audiences had the rare opportunity to enjoy this unique work the way its creator intended-in its entirety and with an ideal cast. "Smartly directed by James Robinson and conducted with sweeping lyricism by Patrick Summers" (San Francisco Chronicle). Soprano Patricia Racette whose many San Francisco Opera triumphs include her incisive portrait of Cio-Cio San in Madama Butterfly"tackled all three soprano roles...and emerged triumphant" (San Francisco Chronicle). In the three diverse soprano roles "Racette modulated the quality and tone of her radiant muscular sound accordingly. The title role in Suor Angelica is the real soprano showcase a virtuoso exercise in both soaring vocalism and emotional specificity and Racette rose superbly to the challenge."
