This documentary explores how feminism has shaped the society we live in. It further problematizes the questions of how much progress has been reached and the relevancy of the feminist movement today. Further women's rights issues such as: violence against women access to abortion and universal childcare are approached and assessed on whether sufficient progress has been made and whether change has been enacted towards bettering the position of women.
