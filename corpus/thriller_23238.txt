On Castillo's sugarcane plantation in the Dominican Republic life was not easy. Senior Castillo was a bitter man who moved to the Caribbean for a fresh start but still harbored an evil deep inside of him. He had many slaves and one who was a priestess from the Afro-Caribbean religion Santeria. Senior Castillo took advantage of her from an early age but once she grew older and more powerful she took revenge and cursed his bloodline. A hundred years later in Miami's Little Havana the spirit of the priestess finds a vessel and is back for retribution. One by one the killer hunts all that remains of the Castillo lineage decapitating each victim leaving the body parts scattered around town. The media glamorizes the serial killer; 'The Santero' because the dismembered remains resembles Santeria offerings.
