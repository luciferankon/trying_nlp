Ronnie Carter Jones is the story of an autistic boy who views his troubled family though the unblinking eye of a video camera. On the surface the Jones family appears to be quite ordinary. They seem to be coping well with an autistic son Ronnie who is manageable as long as he has his video camera in hand. But underneath the surface and behind the lens of the camera tiny ripples run into a tidal wave of accusations infidelity and violence ripping this family unit apart. Ronnie Carter Jones earned a bronze award at the 25th Annual Worldfest Houston International Film Festival for Original Dramatic Short.
