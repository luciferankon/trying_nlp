Pratfalls and double-takes. Pie fights and car chases. Banana peels and seltzer bottles. Prepare to laugh until you cry with this month's celebration of slapstick comedies. Each Tuesday and Wednesday night in September the TCM Spotlight will look at the history of the genre from the silent masters of the form (Charlie Chaplin Harold Lloyd Buster Keaton) to the TCM premiere of "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" (2004) starring Will Ferrell.
