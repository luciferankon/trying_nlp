Twenty-nine kilometers from Ajmer surrounded by the Aravalli hills in the heart of the Thar Desert is a lake city called Pushkar. To the Hindus of the world it is second in holiness only to Mansarovar. During the full moon in the month of Kartik the town and the nearby dunes become an enormous fairground. Thousands of villagers bring cattle camels and horses to trade. Folk artists musicians Ferris wheels and merry-go-rounds appear like a mirage in the desert only to vanish with the decapitation of Brahma's fifth head.
