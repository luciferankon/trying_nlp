Cameron Parish Louisiana. 1957. Hurricane Audrey crashes ashore twelve hours earlier than projected. Residents of quiet coastal towns wake to find they are trapped by rising water. Houses begin to break apart. Livestock and farming equipment swirl through the streets. Survivors cling to oak trees a refrigerator and rooftops as they brace for a massive tidal wave rolling toward them through the marsh.
