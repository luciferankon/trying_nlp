Welcome to Go Go Crazy: a contest where talent and ambition take a backseat to speedos and desperation. Five shameless contestants with little to gain and nothing to lose take to the stage in a gay nightclub for a chance to achieve go go boy glory and a $1000 cash prize. On the judging panel are a burned out porn star a Celine Dion "embodier" and the raunchy nightclub owner - all of whom threaten to steal the spotlight from the fame-hungry back-stabbing contestants. Starring iconic drag comedian Hedda Lettuce gay adult film star Jake Steel and some sexy broadway actors Go Go Crazy is a hilarious outrageous mockumentary from director Fred M. Caruso (The Big Gay Musical). With a little sex sabotage and dirty tricks this movie will turn you on bend you over with laughter and then give you a happy ending.
