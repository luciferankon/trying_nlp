For 17-year-old Charlotte it's the last summer before she leaves for college and says goodbye to her small Georgia town - a place haunted by her mother's recent suicide and the abrupt disappearance of Joe the boy she once loved. Swimming in twilit lakes and driving down country roads singing along with her tight group of friends Charlotte tries to make the most of it. But when Joe suddenly reappears on the same night that a mythic killer emerges in her town preying on girls with an uncanny resemblance to her Charlotte is forced to reconcile nostalgia and trauma in a way that may haunt her forever - as summer draws to a hallucinatory and nightmarish conclusion.
