We enter the house of two flatmates Ricardo a compulsive coffee drinker and Lauren who spends her time preparing her nails for a social occasion which will never occur. They pass time wordlessly in front of the TV Ricardo only moving for coffee refills from his ordered kitchen of labelled jars and labelled mugs. A dripping tap an outside force that Ricardo just can't stop interrupts this status quo. Over the course of three nights the order of his world is destroyed until finally a different perspective is physically forced upon him. But as his journey ends Lauren's is just beginning.
