This personal narrative documentary uses my bicycle ride to work as a vehicle to explore fear and global warming. In the tradition of Ross McElwee I created an autobiographical film in which I meditate on a universal human theme with a camera strapped to my bike. It is a contemplative response to An Inconvenient Truth and provides a unique perspective on one person's attempt to reduce her carbon footprint and overcome fear.
