'101' is in reverence to Abel Gance's film 'J'accuse!' which is regarded as one of the most important ant-war films in history. For which reason '101' has been produced on the basis of a silent structure. The film deals with the Battle of Tannenberg which was fought in 1914 in East Prussia. It ended in victory for the Germans over the Russian armed forces. The commander-in-chief of the German army Paul von Hindenburg would go down in history as the 'victor of Tannenberg' because the German command decided to name the battle after the village of Tannenberg which was located close to where the fighting actually took place. In this way the Germans were trying to debunk the history of a defeat they had suffered in the first Battle of Tannenberg more than 500 years earlier in 1410. '101' is also concerned with today's world which is shown from the perspective of the same protagonists playing the historic roles in the film. Theire viewpoints in the form of documentary tableaus are immersed in the main plot of the film in accordance with a subjective musical narration as is characteristic for a silent film. '101' is an artistic view of the world today in a specific historic context one which raises the question of whether 101 years after the outbreak of World War I it even makes sense anymore to shoot a further anti-ware film? And whether it is even worthwhile today to revere the film 'J'accuse!' which has sunk almost into oblivion.
