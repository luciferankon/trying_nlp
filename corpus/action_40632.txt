In an alternate time-line of Earth's history an arms-dealer company known as Avalon is discovered to be responsible for profiting off of war machine development during WWII. However once the war was over Avalon started losing their profits. Avalon then forms a mercenary army to attack various post-WWII affected countries using previously used planes from both the Axis and the Allied forces in an attempt to keep the war going and thus increase profit. A united Naval/Air Force team is assembled on the USS Enterprise in order to take down Avalon and stop their greed-fueled assault.
