This short lived superhero show was about a Children's book writer named Nicholas. In the daytime he was kind funny and caring. At night he would transform into Jon Sable a superhero/vigilante. His sidekick of sorts was a blind man nicknamed Cheesecake who pretended he was a stand up comedian (He even had his own laugh track!!!). In a loose adaptation of the NON-SUPERHERO comic book Jon Sable Freelance This series focused on Nicholas Fleming a seemingly mild-mannered successful children's book author. Few people know the truth about Fleming: His name is actually Jon Sable and he is a highly-skilled mercenary wanted in Africa for murders he did not commit. Having lost his own family to violence in his past Sable operates beneath the law secretly employing his skills to help the innocent in New York--especially if there are children involved. Sharing his secret are his publisher/sometimes girlfriend Eden and his associate "Cheesecake" a computer hacker.
