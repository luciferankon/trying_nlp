There is a super volcano in New Mexico that can be seen from space. It is one of the most scientifically important volcanoes on the planet. It is the ancient homeland of the Jemez Pueblo Indians and it is the source of political turmoil. It is known as the Valles Caldera. This environmental science documentary focuses on the Valles Caldera National Preserve in the high mountains of northern New Mexico. The Preserve is situated inside a collapsed crater surrounded by eruptive domes and features the 11254 ft Redondo Peak. Much of the year the Valles area is an emerald gem amidst the serene New Mexico landscape. This is a story of a unique landscape considered sacred to many tribes in the region and treasured by scientists worldwide. We transport viewers to the grandeur and stunning beauty of one of America's most captivating natural environments. The Valles Caldera is the location that inspired Volcanologist Bob Smith to develop the theory of Resurgent Domes and is the key model for Caldera theory worldwide.
