New York 1905. Sue and Johnsy are two painters who share a studio. Johnsy falls sick with pneumonia and doesn't improve. Sue notices that her friend is always looking through the window by her bed. There is only a brick house some feet away. It is autumn. The wind never stops howling. An old ivy vine climbing half way up the brick wall. It has been stripped of almost all its leaves. Is then when Sue realizes that Johnsy is convinced she'll die when the last leaf falls off.
