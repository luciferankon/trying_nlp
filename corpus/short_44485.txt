This personal and experimental film juxtaposes scenes of home video recordings with letters from the director's mother sent 20 years later. The director's decision to leave the family's faith results in an ultimatum from her mother a devout Jehovah's Witness: either return to Jehovah or never see her again. As the choices are revealed the film discovers what has been lost and questions why subsequent generations often repeat the past.
