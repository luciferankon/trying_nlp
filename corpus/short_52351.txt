Vaudeville performer 'Luis Martinetti' (qv) demonstrates his novelty acrobatic act. Performing on the flying rings he puts his legs through the rings and then contorts himself so that his head is between his legs. He swivels around to take up several different positions in each case twisting his body around as necessary.
