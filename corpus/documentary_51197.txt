Three Continents based on the 15-part documentary series Chinese Restaurants tells the story of the Chinese Diaspora through its most recognizable and enduring icon - the family-run Chinese restaurant. Filmmaker Cheuk Kwan visits Madagascar Norway and Canada exploring the meaning of "home" in Chinese communities that have established themselves on three continents. Together these community and personal histories illustrate the wider story of Chinese migration settlement and integration.
