When a rich man dies some items from a collection of his are stolen- an ancient Egyptian gold amulet and the mummy that was wearing it. The police consult scholars from the local University to help with the investigation which is taking a more serious turn as people connected with the case are killed by wounds that seem to be from a housecat.
