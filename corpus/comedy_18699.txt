Frances Collins has been married five years and isn't yet at ease with her married name. She packs a suitcase and heads for work. Rather than return home at night she changes clothes in the company washroom and goes to bars looking for a man in whose bed she can spend the night. Sometimes she doesn't find one; drunk she sleeps wherever she falls. Various folks befriend her: a widow a musician a john. A nervous young man offers her a place to rest and clean up. When she leaves his apartment she forgets her purse; he finds her I. D.  and goes to her place to return the purse. What awaits him isn't pretty. Will Frances eventually return home? How will she handle what she finds?
