Road to FA Cup is a six-part semi improvisational mockumentary series that follows the behind the scenes activity at lowly non-league football club the Croydon Terriers. This recently established South London team have for the first time earned their place in the pre-preliminary rounds of the FA Cup. On the back of this relative success enter newly appointed chairman Niall Reedwood a clueless playboy business man and A-list wannabe deluded that this could be his ticket to the big time. Disaster looms however as the club is rocked by on and off the field problems; from player disputes to board room bust-ups as the pressure of being filmed begins to show. The Terriers sign Italian defender Luca Tardelli (who speaks no English). Surely a move like this will bring in instant success? How will legendary manager Ray Barnes get on with the new ambitious owner? And how will the replacement of Captain Ian 'Speedo' Davis go down with the team? Satirizing the state of sport and celebrity-culture within the UK the series has taken stylistic inspiration from BAFTA nominated show 'The Thick of It' whilst it's format will be familiar to fans of 'The Office'. This... Is Road to FA Cup.
