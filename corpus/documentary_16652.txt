This 18-song set from Nat "King" Cole is visual tribute to one of the most elegant trailblazers in history. Born on St. Patrick's Day 1919 Nathaniel Adams Coles took to the piano at an early ago and formed his own group while in his teens. Nat put a royal sobriquet in the middle dropped the 's' from his last name and truly became "King." He was the most successful Black recording artist of his time selling over 50 million records by 1950. His smooth sensuous vocals bridged America's changing tastes from pre- World War II to a post-war world in a hurry. Nat "King" Cole became the first African-American to host a national tv show in 1955 setting standards for all who followed. He remains a musical treasure more than half a century after his death.
