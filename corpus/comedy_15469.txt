Sophisticated comedy: a trio of money hungry women who all have sugar daddies who keep them in the lap of luxury even as they drive the men crazy. Each woman represents a different personality type from sensitive to kind-hearted to difficult and untrustworthy. Set in the age of jazz the twenties come roaring back with immorality and in-fighting.
