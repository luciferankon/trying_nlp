To fully illustrate my point and to serve as an example of what happens to the human animal and the human psychic I have decided to serve as an ultimate example in hopes of motivating people to once and for all change their ways. Unlike similar documentaries my efforts will not be extreme. Rather they will simply follow the norm and the shocking results that many of us may not be aware break down our minds and bodies. I have begun with a healthy mind and body as has been my personal "choice" for most of my life. I eat very well exercise regularly and monitor my progresses making health a top priority. I have been evaluated both clinically and psychologically to set the median creating a point of which to begin that is measurable. Then I simply stopped everything. Again I have done so not to the extreme but by simply following the lifestyle choices of the "average American". From this vantage point my deconstruction process begins as my healthy body serves to develop a multitude of unhealthful conditions to include of course an increase in body fat. Further and perhaps most importantly the psychological affects of depression anxiety a lack of energy and likely mood extremes. All aspects are systematically measured and tracked by professionals and various field experts. Then as quickly as I have deconstructed the rebuilding process shall begin. It is during this phase that we reverse virtually all of the damage and rebuild my mind and body to not only the point from which I started but exceeding my fitness levels as so many unhealthful American can accomplish also. In so doing we take the journey from health to disease and back again.
