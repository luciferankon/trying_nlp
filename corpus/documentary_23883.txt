Back in late 2005 24 year old filmmaker Mark Jeavons set out to make an ambitious feature film called: 'Whatever Happened to Pete Blaggit'. Shooting on super 16mm with a small budget Jeavons put together a talented cast & crew and cameras rolled in August 2006. It wouldn't be until November 2010 that the film would be finished after four long years of blood sweat and tears. 'Four Years Two Wigs & One Fridge: the Pete Blaggit story' is a warts-and-all documentary revealing the roller coaster ride of trying to get the film finished when it seemed all hope had been lost. Featuring interviews with Mark Jeavons casting director James Booth and leading actors Rob Leetham and Andy Pandini the documentary is a refreshingly honest and candid re-telling of the struggle to bring Pete Blaggit to the big screen.
