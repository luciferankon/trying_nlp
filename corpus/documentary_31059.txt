But he is caught by surprise when he reads about the effect of excess carbon dioxide on the ocean in Elizabeth Kolbert's New Yorker article "The Darkening Sea." Sven embarks on a mission to learn more wrestling with the possibility that his five-year-old grandson Elias will inherit an ocean bereft of the fish which have meant so much to their family. Sven uncovers research on the world's acidifying seas and its dramatic implications for our culture and economy.
