A high-spirited weekend spirals out of control for a gang of friends in outer suburban Melbourne. Jackie loses her job Kyle scores his first drug deal Rolf and Sasha trip and Arko ends up dead. The film exposes the harsh and humorous reality of growing up in suburbia whilst taking a poignant and sardonic look at the cynicism of today's media. The humanity of the characters is brought to life through humour tragedy and some good 'news'.
