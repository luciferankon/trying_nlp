Wenceslas the young king of Bohemia lives trapped between the wisdom of his Christian grandmother and his ever constant battle with his tyranical step-mother. She wants her own son to be king and constantly tries to stay in charge of Weceslas's life (including picking out a bride for him). But it is only when he sees the suffering of his people that Wenceslas learns how vital it is that his step-brother never rules.
