A babysitter with a clever and violent ward. A patient who mistrusts the doctor's orders. A young woman haunted by a malevolent presence. And the terror that ties them all together: BUGS. On their own spiders parasites and bedbugs hold their own private horror for those who are beset by the quiet scuttles and slurps of inhuman creatures. But for Diane Hannah and Elena three varied yet eerily similar women these bugs represent the larger horrors of paranoia helplessness and abandonment. The Bugs Trilogy explores the inequality of the watcher and ward relationships between mothers and their children and the measures we are willing to take to protect ourselves from dangers we do not want to comprehend.
