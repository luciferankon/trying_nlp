Five children from a 5th grade class. Three boys two girls: Nils Roberts Tomass Beate and Elza. During a Friday morning assembly they learn from their homeroom teacher that their classmate Elvis has been absent without explanation for a long time. Nils overhears two teachers saying that they are unable to reach Elvis or his mother - no one answers the phone and no one knows where they are. Nils senses that the grown-ups don't seem interested in finding out what has happened to Elvis. Nils however is very curious and gets some of his classmates to help investigate. The children all come from different social backgrounds but have on thing in common: adults and parents have little time for them.
