Three hapless directors arrive in England from Italy to make a documentary on their idol. The funny thing is they have no interviews lined up! Not to worry these guys have a miracle or two that they call in. The Stanley and Us project is a totally independent project which is always in progress. The shooting began in 1997 during the Venice Film Festival when the Golden Lion for the career was given to Mr. Kubrick. The final result included interviews to more than 50 collaborators friends and relatives many shootings on the Kubrick's movie locations and a collection of documentation material such as photos and screenplays. Most part of this material was organised in 38 episodes of 15 minutes each plus a 1 hour film for the Italian satellite channel Rai Sat a book and a worldwide DVD release.
