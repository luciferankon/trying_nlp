Revival of the popular 1974-1978 game show and again hosted by Bert Convy. 3 celebrity couples competed each playing for 1/3 of the studio audience separated into blue yellow (banana) and red rooting sections. The husbands/wives were taken offstage while their wives/husbands were asked a question; matching answers won a share of $150 for their rooting section of the audience. Midway through the Show the husbands and wives traded places to play the game as before. After the 4th & Last Question worth $300 the couple(s) with the most money won a share of the $1000 bonus.
