A modern day fable based on the classic Don Quixote set in a small town on the Texas-Mexican border. On one side a gang of vigilante ranchers stands dead-set on rounding up illegal aliens crossing the border. On the other an elementary school history teacher obsessed with America's revolutionary past and consumed by the need to stand up for his radical beliefs. Frustrated by his failure to change the minds of the citizens of Borderland the teacher's passion throws him over the edge and into a rebellious alter ego still fighting the American Revolution. In the name of Lady Liberty this modern day Don Quixote rides courageously towards a confrontation with the ranchers and his date with destiny.
