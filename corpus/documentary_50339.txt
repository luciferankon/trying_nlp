BBC documentary written and presented by the famous English conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner. It is a rigorous biography that tries to show the man and the musician at the same time. Gardiner reveals an artist so complex and passionate; a family man both warm and cozy who must fight the hierarchies of the state and the Lutheran Church to accomplish her art.
