The Royal Barge was designed by Swedish shipbuilder Fredrik Henrik af Chapman and was completed in 1774. It was destroyed in a big fire in 1921. After a private fund raising a replica of the original barge was built after the saved original drawings currently on the Maritime Museum in Stockholm. This documentary takes the viewer back to the day in 1923 when the Swedish King Gustav V inaugurated the Stockholm City Hall and when the HMS Vasaorden was used for the first time. The film is scheduled to be up for sale for Christmas 2010 to include the Maritime Museum the Vasa Museum in four languages and others.
