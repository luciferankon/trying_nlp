Brooklyn Bloomberg and friends do some steamy kibbutzing in this fascinating piece of Yiddish-keit circa 1923. Rare 16mm archival erotica footage is overlaid with a hilarious Jewish porno voiceover - sprinkled with colloquial Yiddishisms. Written and performed by San Francisco artist Dori Midnight (aka Brooklyn Bloomberg) Matzo Maidels is a wildly entertaining short that's sure to amuse audiences of all persuasions.
