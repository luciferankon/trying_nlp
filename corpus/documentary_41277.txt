Childhood DENIED tells this tragic story through the eyes of the narrator Ania. She is a young girl taken by train in the winter of 1940 to Stalin's killing fields in Siberia. Ania is a composite of the thousands of children whose lives were violently ripped apart often never to be repaired. The tragedy is amplified today by the fact that few people know about this chapter in the history of WWII.
