Two typical flatmates live together in Suburban Perth. Like all flatmates they do their best to pretend to like each other. In reality though they hate each other and can't wait to get one up at the others expense. Jill hates Steve with a passion she thinks he's a lazy idiot because he never listens to her. Steve is petrified of Jill so he does his best to stay out of her way. But sometimes.. they meet.. What will they get up to?
