Norway is a small country. It is also relatively homogeneous and egalitarian. This means that the distance from top to bottom is short and that great disasters affect the entire populace. It was out of this world that the thirty-two-year-old Anders Behring Breivik stepped when on the afternoon of July 22 2011 he set out from his mother's flat in Oslo's West End changed into a police uniform parked a van containing a bomb which he had spent the spring and summer making outside the governments buildings lit the fuse and left the scene. While the catastrophic images of the attack which killed eight people were being broadcast across the world Breivik headed to Ut≈ôya. That was where the Workers' Youth League had its annual summer camp. There Breivik shot and killed sixty-nine people in a massacre that lasted for more than an hour right until the police arrived when he immediately surrendered.
