Our wheat has changed dramatically it doesn't even resemble what it used to look like. Not only are we seeing more wheat and gluten sensitivity there is also a strong connection between gluten and autoimmune diseases. Tens of thousands of people are suffering with ill health and don't realise it's a result of the food choices they are making. Some assume it is part of their genetic make-up or the body changing as they get older. People need to become educated knowledgeable and aware. They need to start making changes to improve the health of their children and future generations.
