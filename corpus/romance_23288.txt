Olivia doesn't quite make it up the aisle and Joe is left jilted at the altar. A decade later Olivia and Joe are walking up the aisle again but this time it's as bridesmaid and best man. They haven't seen each other since and they have changed. Olivia wears pleated skirts and designs multi-storey carparks; Joe is older wiser sexier and married to a Spanish model Mariana. But all is not as it seems. Will first love get a second chance?
