Cameras follow Canadians with kidney disease who grapple with the life-and-death decision to buy an organ on the black market. The documentary travels to Turkey and the Philippines to interview kidney sellers and brokers. In North America doctors and bio-ethicists express their conflicting views some firmly against the trade and others in support of regulating it. While addressing the provocative and ethical issues surrounding the organ trade in Transplant Tourism it becomes more and more evident that the young poor and vulnerable in the developing world are increasingly being treated as spare body parts for the rich.
