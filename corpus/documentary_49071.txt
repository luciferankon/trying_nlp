On the Weekend of the 6th and 7th of July 1996 one of Australia's largest outdoor dance music events was staged at Cataract Scout Park about an hour's drive from Sydney. 'The Dream' captures the essence of the event from the first days of set-up right through to the end. It's all there. The DJ's The Bands The Dancers The Outdoor Fireworks The Lighting The Lasers and most importantly... the people... see thousands of smiling faces enjoy one of Australia's finest events.
