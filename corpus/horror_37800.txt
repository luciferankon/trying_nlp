The story is about a young man called Fanis who suffers from a persisting nightmare which started after he lost his entire family in a traffic accident involving a dark forest and a makeshift religious shrine. In an effort to find answers to his problem he resorts to an online investigation which leads him to people of a sinister demonic nature. To prove his claims he decides to make a video documentary of the 7th person he will meet a Serbian girl. Having lost his family in a car accident Fanis is tormented by the same dream every night in which he wanders through a dark forest always ending up at a makeshift religious shrine. As he searches for the truth online Fanis begins to suspect that some of the people he meets are not who they say they are and he decides to videotape every aspect of his latest (and possibly last) meeting.
