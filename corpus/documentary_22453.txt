Trees talk know family ties and care for their young? Is this too fantastic to be true? German forester Peter Wohlleben ('The Hidden Life of Trees') and scientist Suzanne Simard (The University of British Columbia Canada) have been observing and investigating the communication between trees over decades. And their findings are most astounding. 'Intelligent Trees' features the main observations that are covered in Peter Wohlleben's book such as the stump that has been kept alive by it's neighboring trees the old tree-couple that looks after each other the Mother Trees that suckle their offspring etc... Special about this film is however that it goes beyond observations and claims but match them with the latest underlying Forest Science Research.
