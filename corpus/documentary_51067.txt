A Yangtze Landscape utilizes a non-narrative style setting off from the Yangtze's marine port Shanghai filming all the way to the Yangtze River's source Qinghai/Tibet - filming a total distance of thousands of kilometers. Experimental music and noise recorded live on scene are used in post-production painstakingly paired with relatively independent visuals creating a magically realistic atmosphere contrasted with people seeming to be 'decorative figures' right out of traditional Chinese landscape scrolls.
