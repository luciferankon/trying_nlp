On Sept. 11 2001 firefighter Stephen Siller left work to meet his brothers so the "perfect foursome" could play a round of golf. But en route news of an airplane hitting the North Tower of the World Trade Center came across his scanner. Stephen turned his car around but was stuck in traffic within the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel. He strapped on his gear ran through the tunnel was picked up by Engine 224 and was brought to Ground Zero-where he then became part of the 343 heroic members of the FDNY who died that day. But Stephen's story didn't end there. For the Love of Their Brother tells how the Siller family turned heartache into heroism by organizing the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Run. What began with a few hundred participants in 2002 and has now spread worldwide raising millions of dollars for charity and keeping Stephen's memory alive.
