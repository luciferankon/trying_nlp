Kichijoji is a popular town that has been voted as the place that people want to live in in the whole of Tokyo many times. There is an old real estate agency called Shigeta that is managed by the Sumita twins Tomiko (Oshima Miyuki) and Miyako (Ando Natsu). People who fantasize of living in Kichijoji visit the agency. However the rent is high and the place is small as well as far from the train station. Why is Kichijoji the only one that is such a great town? Customers are bewildered that the twins keep suggesting towns other than Kichijoji. But as they are shown around they unwittingly find themselves drawn to these locations and decide to find a town of their own that they want to go back to and move there.
