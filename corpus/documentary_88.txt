A documentary attending the origin of a film. The small team of director Bernd Schoch went through the struggles of a 36-hour bus ride to Bucharest to follow his professor Didi Danquart who was shooting his film "Offset" in the city. ONSET/OFFSET is less a "making of" but rather a colorful introduction to the country and its people of the new candidate joining the EU.
