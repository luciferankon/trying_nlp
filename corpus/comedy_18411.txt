San Gabriel Valley (SGV) is an anthology of mini-stories designed to explore the diaspora of sexuality. Every scene in the first season of SGV ends in an orgasm. The climax of each short vignette is an actual climax. In fact the journey to each climax is the significance of this series - how different unions alter the reality of a world that is typically inhibited about such topics. Join Sydney Jamaica Orlando Dean Virginia and the Delivery Guy in the world of San Gabriel Valley. A world where sex is peace and no more problems exist for you and me.
