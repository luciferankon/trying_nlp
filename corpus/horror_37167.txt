Kelton's Dark Corner can best be described as "Ed Wood meets Raymond Chandler". An older wiser more resilient Kelton the Cop best known for facing off against aliens zombies and disembodied spirits finds himself on the mean streets of L.a. confronting real life monsters like a character in a Joseph Conrad novel in a literal figurative and psychological jungle hell.
