With a unique blend of traditional ballet steps and non-traditional music. Ballet Unchained includes 12 exercises at the barre and 14 in the center. These exercises are designed to fit into a compact space such as a living room. Each exercise is demonstrated and danced but the video format allows you to skip the demonstrations once you become familiar with the exercises.
