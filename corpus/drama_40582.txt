The summer of 1914. A world goes to war. As do two young English women - Elsie Knocker (28) and Mairi Chisholm. One a divorcee and mother the other an eighteen-year-old tomboy beauty. Four years later they return to England - one married the other bereaved. But both of them scarred by the horrors and terrors they have witnessed and suffered. Both enriched by the courage and fortitude they found in themselves and others.
