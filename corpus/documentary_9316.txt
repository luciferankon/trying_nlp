This is a wonderful documentary that shows the full scope of Earl Hamner Jr's talent. Most people know him as the real life "John Boy" but do not realize that he wrote for shows such as the Twilight Zone. I highly recommend this documentary especially for fans of the Waltons. It will touch your heart & bring tears to your eyes.
