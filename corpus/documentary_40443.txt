Kristina Kappelin travels to 15 different countries in an attempt to capture the heart and soul of Europe. In a series of three episodes she takes us fishing in the British countryside and searching for the man who opened the Berlin wall one night in November 1989. She also has a go at finding Europes absolute middle-point. Is it in Ukraine or perhaps in Sweden?
