Not an adaptation of beat writer William S. Burrough's novel but a mix of biography and an interpretation of his drug- induced writing processes combined with elements of his work in this paranoid fantasy about Bill Lee a writer who accidentally shoots his wife whose typewriter transforms into a cockroach and who becomes involved in a mysterious plot in North African port called Interzone. Wonderfully bizarre not unlike Burrough's books. Exterminator Bill Lee finds himself following his wife into an addiction to the bug powder he uses. After accidentally killing her he descends into a hallucinatory existence in which he imagines himself a secret agent answering to a series of bizarre creatures. He channels his energies into writing "reports" on his delusional mission while trying to break his addiction. The story loosely reflects events in the life of author Burroughs as he wrote the novel.
