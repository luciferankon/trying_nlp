Two elderly men vie for the love of the equally elderly Bok-rae. She chooses Deok-su. The spurned suitor Yeong-gam refuses food and becomes very sickly. Deok-su has a stroke and his elderly wife must work to support him and pay for his medication while Yeong-gam accuses him of ruining Bok-rae's life.
