Whilst Rush have always been considered one of Rock's greatest hidden treasures with complex intricate musicianship it can never be said that Music Video was their fort√©. With this collection of 'hit' videos from Rush we can see why. Almost befittingly Rush's best videos appear to be those that simply demonstrate their playing. Studio footage of Rush is rare and welcomed on this DVD
