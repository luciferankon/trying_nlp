Apolinario dela Cruz known as Hermano Puli was shot and quartered on November 41841-three decades before the execution of the GOMBURZA. Among all of the Filipino heroes Hermano Puli stands alone for leading the only revolt against the Spanish colonial government in the name of religious freedom. This film sheds light on one of the most fascinating yet almost forgotten figures in Philippine History.
