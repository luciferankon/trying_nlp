Taking place around 04/04/04 over the course of four days an abandoned car is haunted by a psychopathic killer's dead ma. Trapped in the car the spirit of the deceased Kate Burns encounters four average Americans who each discover and use the car to their own personal gain. But Kate has other plans namely a reunion with her son recently escaped convict Norm Burns. The theme of karmic justice provokes the question "What's more frightening and bizarre....the supernatural or reality?"
