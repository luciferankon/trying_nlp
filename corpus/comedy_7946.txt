An elderly lady is visited each month by her good-for-nothing nephew who relieves her of her regular pension. When he appears again one winter day accompanied by two hideous but eager pals who start roasting a freshly captured piglet on her back lawn before maltreating her cat and retreating to sleep in the sauna she can no longer stand it. So at dawn she packs up to flee into town where she moves in with an old friend who gives her consolation and advice.
