Deep in the Peruvian rainforest a policeman is killed. The government rounds up the usual suspects and picks out indigenous leaders as murderers and terrorists. But no one has actually witnessed who fired the gun and even fewer cares about the torture and the following revenge murder carried out by the police. The indigenous are poor and despised so their chances of winning a courtroom battle are next to none. But a young indigenous leader Fachin refuses to give in. He contacts a well known Peruvian defense lawyer who specializes in indigenous cases and starts fighting back! And wins!
