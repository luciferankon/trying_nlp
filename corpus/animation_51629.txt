Classic German good night stories on TV. Originally invented in the east it was soon also produced in the West and is still shown today at 6:50pm. The Sandman is a small man with a white beard that comes at night and spreads sand onto the eyes of the sleeping children. This is the beginning sequence while there is singing and the typical music. This is followed by a cartoon which is different from episode to episode often featuring children or animals. After 10 minutes it ends with an end sequence similar to the one at the beginning but this time they sing: "Kinder liebe Kinder es hat mir Spaß gemacht nun schnell ins Bett und schlaft recht schön dann will auch ich zur Ruhe gehn. Ich wünsch euch Gute Nacht."
