This is a story of a seven-year old girl named Milica who lives somewhere in Europe. Today in the 21st century she is living without one of the main freedom rights-child play. She gets up every morning hoping that she will be surrounded by friends. Unfortunately reality is different... One day she will ask herself: Why? How are we as adults supposed to find an answer to that question? This is also a story about our consciousness.
