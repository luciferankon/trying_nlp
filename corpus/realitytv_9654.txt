Eric Bauman (Chris Jericho)is a down and out web designer who is having trouble launching any original ideas. He stumbles on the idea of creating a website that is full of only recycled and or stolen content to drive hits . His idea works and he names the site ebaumsworld ( also stole the name idea from Wayne's world) . He soon builds an empire based on funny stuff he finds on the internet. But it's not all fun and games along the way he meets many trials and tribulations. A feel good story about a boy coming of age in the computer age.
