Meet Yindi. A baby koala who almost loses his mother in a car accident and in her absence must be raised in captivity. Follow his zany adventures as the curious young koala cub just acts like 'himself' but is surrounded by humans! When the mother and son are reunited months later Yindi's mother begins to teach him to do things the "wild koala" way. Eventually the two are released back to the Australian Bush together to live free as a koala family should.
