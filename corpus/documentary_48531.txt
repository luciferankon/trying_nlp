'Bi the Way' investigates the recent rise in the "whatever" phenomenon. Featuring interviews this documentary explores the changing sexual landscape of America in a bizarre and hilarious road trip that takes us from a swinging cage fighter in LA to an 11-year-old in Texas to a cheerleader-turned-runaway in Memphis. Following the personal stories of five young people the film also grabs hold of the country's pulse on the topic.
