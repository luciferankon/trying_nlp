BLINDSPOT: Illusions of Justice is a tale of crusading survivors legislators and journalists working together to right the historical wrongs of a frightening practice in reproductive injustice. Four years in the making and set in North Carolina the film is the only behind the scenes account of the recent legislative effort to compensate victims of government-ordered and authorized sterilization abuse. From the New Deal to Watergate North Carolina ran the nation's longest and one of its largest and most aggressive sterilization programs. More than 7600 men women and children many of whom were poor undereducated or disabled were sterilized under state law by force or coercion between 1933 and 1974. BLINDSPOT intimately portrays the stories of victims of sterilization abuse in North Carolina while simultaneously mining a dark chapter in broader U.S. history.
