The Young Marrieds centered around the difficulties in the lives of several newly-married couples. There were Walter and Ann Reynolds (Walter was having an affair with model Carol West); Liz and Matt Stevens (Liz's mother Irene interfered in their lives whenever possible); and Susan and Dan Garrett who were desperately trying to regain custody of Susan's child Jerry Karr away from Lena and Roy Gilroy.
