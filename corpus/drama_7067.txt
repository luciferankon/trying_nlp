Tape is a story that takes place amidst a conflict a film centred on stories of the youth of Jerusalem. The film focuses specifically on the lives of Ian Stephanie Daniel Adylia and Aaron. They are a group of friends both Palestinian and Israeli who struggle to live amongst one another in a country that has been torn apart by politics religion and conflicting histories. We feel that at a time where tensions are rising more than they ever have before in Jerusalem where stereotypes are all too common and false generalisations are far too often made - a film that actually gives voice to a diverse culture of people that are completely misrepresented in media as well as tells a story through those people - is an incredibly important and current message to convey.
