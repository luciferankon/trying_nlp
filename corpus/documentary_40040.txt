'Animal House of Blues' 331/3 is the latest and greatest edition of an award winning documentary film made by passionate cast and crew members that worked on 'National Lampoon's Animal House'. We wanted to share with the world additional behind-the-scenes-never-before-told stories of how the Psychedelic Merry Pranksters saved the production from being scrapped by the studio and the Birth of the Blues Brothers as well as many others. The documentary was created while mentoring 5 graduating classes of young filmmakers through never-before-seen archival interviews and images. Now it has been re shot and re-edited by the professionals who mentored the students' earlier versions and has utilized hundreds of new black and white images from the actual behind-the-scenes filming. The incredible soundtrack includes re-mastered and never-before-released reel-to-reel tracks of John Belushi singing with Robert Cray and Curtis Salgado at the Eugene Hotel on October 31st 1977. Over the last five years each edition has added more and more footage when Original 'Animal House' cast (like Otis Day and Knight Robert Bailey) heard about the film and wanted to be in it. This version includes an in depth interview with D.K. Stewart who not only played the piano as a band member for Belushi singing on stage but also recorded him. It also has delved deeper into the interviews with these cast members than previous versions. If you loved 'Animal House' or 'The Blues Brothers' you and your friends will be glad you watched it from this very revealing point of view!
