About my 5th week of film school I was getting very frustrated. The workload was getting very heavy there was very little help from anyone and all the teachers lectured about was how this was a hopeless business and we'd probably never make it. This film was how I expressed my irritation with it all. Four young filmmakers enroll at the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles with hopes of becoming rich and famous. A Director (Timothy Bogard) a Producer (Roland Stimpson) a Screenwriter (Ryan Higdon) and an Actress (Adi Golan). Many years later they get their chance. They are all involved in making the sequel: Titanic II. It seemed like a great idea build upon one of the most successful films of all time. A story about how they find Jack encased in ice and he awakes in 100 years later to find the world a completely different place. The film is a terrible flop and all four's carries end just as they begin. They see no hope and to look for another carrier would be a major step down so they all take their lives. The Producer with a razor blade the Screenwriter with a plastic bag the Actress with pills and the Director with a gun.
