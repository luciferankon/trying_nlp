The first scene shows the arrival of the female recruits. It is rather an unwieldy crowd to be sure but with that "neatness and dispatch" for which the military branch of the national defence is noted they are furnished with the proper accoutrements and before some of the fair defenders find themselves ready for it are actually in the service. They are put through a severe course of instruction and training against which some of them religiously rebel and then they are taught the art of riding as real soldiers ride. For this purpose diminutive donkeys are used and it is a serious question which will be pronounced the ''cutest" the donkeys or the fair equestriennes. Perhaps the failure of some of the recruits to successfully compass the donkey ride is due to the flirtatious efforts of the officers. At all events there is considerable "playing of eyes and covert smiles" which we are all bound to admit is not likely to furnish any duty. Dressed in their spick-and-span soldier clothes the petticoat regiment is put through a series of field maneuvers followed by an alarm to action which pitches them into the midst of a very hot battle. They are called upon to storm a hill and right gallantly they do their task. But even female courage cannot stand the storm of shot and shell They gain two-thirds of the incline and then are forced steadily back. Their retreat quickly turns into an utter rout and over hill and dale they flee led by the gallant standard-bearer. Their pursuers are gaining steadily and are about to fall upon them from the rear when they are rescued by a female band not yet in soldier toggery. The act closes with a general jollification in which the officers bravely join embracing right and left in a not altogether vain endeavor to be known as impartial with their appreciation.
