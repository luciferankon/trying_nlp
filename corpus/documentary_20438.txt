In 2010 Chrysovalantis Stamelos moved to Turkey. His family and friends thought he was crazy. His response - "maybe I was." But he could not shake the stories he had heard growing up of old Smyrna and Asia Minor. "Hello Anatolia" (Crescent Street Films) tells the story of a young Greek American film- maker who embarks on the journey of his life to Izmir (Smyrna) Turkey to trace the foot- steps of his great grandparents in their native land. In his effort to strengthen his own connection to his cultural heritage he becomes a bridge builder of two cultures - and two peoples - who share a lot more than they have that divides them.
