In this video/film presentation Roderick L. Evans presents compelling information concerning the Christian doctrine of favor. The favor of God reflects the personal way in which God interacts with His people. God's favor will get you into trouble get you out of trouble and get you into glory. In this message be reminded to be grateful for God's graciousness; that is A Force Called Favor.
