Brothers Francis and Douglas Oberon find themselves cut off from the family fortune by their late grandmother's will. Their distant cousin (once removed) maidservant Antoinette "Toni" Oberon is the benefactor of the entire estate fortune and is arriving to view her new property. Facing being homeless broke and actually working for a living the boys devise a plot to either marry Toni (and share the fortune) or kill her off and claim the estate for themselves.
