This video is about a girl who risks it all and loses herself for a man who fills in the visible gaps in her life by studying her likes and dislikes in order to mirror and own her. She throws away a relationship which has lost its spark and is lured in by the glistening promises of things she thinks matter the most...until what matters the most happens and she realizes only too late who was there for her the whole time.
