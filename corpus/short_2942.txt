On a stage set for his act the juggler appears and after taking his position on his back on a stand proceeds to do the most wonderful balancing and juggling feats with his feet being more skillful than many jugglers are with their hands. He takes a heavy table and spins it around and around over and over until one wonders why he never gets dizzy and makes a miss. His exhibition is really a wonder.
