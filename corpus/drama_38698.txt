Francis McGowan is a man with a purpose who instead gets side-tracked during one surreal week spent trying to figure out what he wants from a business that makes very little sense to him a woman he's sleeping with who's not his wife and a father who has left him to fend for himself and didn't leave a map. Francis is an out of work sit-com actor returning to his empty childhood home on the Jersey shore to deal with the aftermath of his father's death. Instead he gets sidetracked by indecision self-doubt and his childhood friend Duane Hopwood. It's about losing your bearings while finding your way.
