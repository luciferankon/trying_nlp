Two men are driving through the mountains when they lose control of their vehicle and fly off a cliff. After a few seconds the car lands hard but when Jim tries to get out to inspect the damage he nearly falls to his death. Thinking they are perched on the edge of cliff they try the other side only find there is nothing there either. With no other options and the only thing they can see around them a foggy darkness they stay in the car and consider that they are dead. They spend the night believing to be in a sort of purgatory and are visited by a strange unknown creature of light. When morning comes they realize what happened the night before and how absolutely lucky they are to be alive.
