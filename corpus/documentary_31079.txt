Over the course of a year a group of young people tries to subsist day by day in the 'tarefa' the 'yerba mate' leaves harvest a painful and underpaid job that consumes their bodies. They are sons of harvesters families raised in a harvesters slum; their hands are destined to be forged at the 'tarefa'. The Yerba mate feeds on young bodies which then throws worn and damaged when they stop being productive. At the beginning of a new harvest season each of them chooses a way to go within their possibilities or lack thereof.
