HEAPS GOOD HOSTEL is a pretty dodgy place to stay but the backpackers don't care it's cheap cheerful and if you pay your cards right you might even get to score a hot Swedish chick. Jaz a strung out university student runs the place single handed and very occasionally gets help from her co-worker Sam when he's not partying with the guests. Long term resident Finnigan is a cranky old sod who complains constantly (but never leaves). Byron is an eccentric gent from England who's living out his boyhood dream of a 'partying lifestyle' and in fact he likes the place so much he may just well buy it! As for the rest of the guests they come from all over the globe and do their inevitable best to make every day interesting.
