A grandmother talks about the love affairs of her youth while her granddaughter pays attention to her favorite soap opera. Narrative memory and soap opera blend to give birth to three stories: that of a grandmother who remembers an old love at the docks that of her granddaughter making parody of the novelistic forms of love and that of a group of sailors who return from a long trip.
