The Masters of Menace are actually a motorcycle gang. When one of their own dies while performing a dangerous bike stunt they decide to cross the country to go bury him. With the coffin in the back of the pick-up truck and the tight-butt lawyer in the front their craving for beer combined with lack of manners will disturb quite a few people wherever they go including the police.
