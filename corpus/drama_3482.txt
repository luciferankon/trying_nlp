A feature-length dark comedy/drama based on the award-winning book. The film follows a highly intelligent young man with picture-perfect memory and synesthesia (mixing of sensory information). Both act as a blessing and a curse as he tries to care for his mother Stella with early on-set Alzheimers. An idiosyncratic group of friends under the influence of a troubled psychotherapist rise to the occasion and help support the fractured family as they band together under one roof.
