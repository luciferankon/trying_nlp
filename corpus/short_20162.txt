'Structures of Nature' is an audiovisual journey in the form of a three-part interaction between four narrators emergent sound events and rhythmicized synaesthetic video sequences. A symbiosis of visual processes and natural and artificial sounds. Images music speech and sounds are commensurate compositional elements that lead the viewer through various microscopic and macroscopic structures of nature in a literal and transcendent sense making them sensuous to the eye and ear.
