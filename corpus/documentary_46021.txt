Musicians from Africa the Balkans and Iran are touring Germany with german songwriter Heinz Ratz and his band. What makes this project special is that most of these musicians are asylum seekers. In Germany refugees like them are subject to special laws that limit their freedom of movement their ability to get a job to choose their place of residence their groceries or clothing. They live in special facilities and are fenced off from rest of the German population. With few points of contact things have remained this way for decades. The concert-tour breaks that pattern and for the group the project offers an opportunity to overcome this crushing isolation through music. By means of a musical documentary about the band the film "I can't be silent" will bring light to the living conditions of asylum seekers.
