Billionaires such as Paul Allen Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are engaged in a race to build a "space tourism" industry but what are their true intentions and why did the aliens select Paul Allen to be their front man? In an era where the disparity between rich and poor is ever-widening why are private corporate interests allowed to secretly hire space aliens and get tax breaks to take over the world? Paul Alien answers these questions and more while exposing the audience to Seattle's sordid economic underbelly of hobo street performers anarchist junkies and the anti-alien resistance. Paul Alien contains shocking surveillance footage of Mr. Allen interacting with strange looking two-foot-tall alien creatures known as "Skoolabugs" from the planet Zorkon. And in a rare interview media-shy Paul Allen admits that he plans to turn Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood into an intergalactic launch pad.
