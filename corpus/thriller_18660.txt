Mark is a geeky LA v-logger specializing in "alt high-risk undiscovered music" and Ginger is the latest obscure singer to be interviewed by him for his online show 'Mind Mutations'. Ginger is really 'out there': not just because she lives in the middle of nowhere in a desert cabin rented from old widower Cliff Tanner but also because she is wackily eccentric. She sends out wildly mixed sexual messages to her guest Mark. For while she drops an early pointed reference to a 'boyfriend' who "might stop by later" she also casually declares that she found Mark's website while "surfing for porn" she laces her conversation with racy innuendo and she even exhibits her 'secret mole'.
