TXIKI is a documentary piece structured around artist Txiki Medina (1958) and focused on the creative process of an oil painting. In order to put together his peculiar geometry the artist takes inspiration from urban spaces and spoilt aspects of Nature places filled with elements which rather than sought have been encountered. There is also a drive towards introspection towards revealing the human interior where silence plays a key role. The trace that the passing of time leaves on each image. Painting as a metaphor of the velocity of time.
