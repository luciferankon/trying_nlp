It's New Year's Eve 2000 and in spite of pessimistic forecasts the earth continues to turn; in fact things seem to not only be running their course but are actually getting better. Optimism and progress are prominent slogans - and seemingly take precedence over earnest thoughts about the future. This is the world of D.J. and would-be womanizer Anti and his clique whose primary concerns are drugs sex and music. In this carefree setting very much to the dismay of his gay friend Anton Anti falls in love with talented hacker Spacey. At the same time Anti's mother Renate takes a fancy to her useful protégé her son's shortish friend Aldi. As these relationships develop homosexual and Christian fundamental drug dealer Jesus strives to re-establish world justice but his naive conception of the 21st century turns out to be transient if anything and what remains is loneliness and the longing for love.
