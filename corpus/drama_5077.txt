Gena a jack of all artistic trades and a member of a group of genius "artists" (composers actors musicians writers chess players etc.) are all in a search for sustenance as event after horrific event confirms to them that "our society has lost the true meaning of art". Gena and her life long friends mourn the sudden death of Michel Felipe (a great painter) as they struggle to find meaning and hope while society ignores the true genius and rewards mediocrity. One has to struggle in order to just be a decent human being. Man longs for the transformational powers of the butterfly. We have lost the true meaning of art...Gena and a group of life long friends (all artistic geniuses) seek sustenance in today's materialistic decadent society as our culture recognizes "pop" as true art and the real artistic talents wallow in obscurity.
