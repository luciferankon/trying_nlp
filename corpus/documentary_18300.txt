In the mid-1960s 1200 White people attend Augustana Lutheran Church in Omaha Nebraska. Nearby Negro Lutherans worship at Hope Lutheran Church. Reverend Bill Youngdahl Augustana's pastor proposes that ten couples visit ten Negro families from Hope. It's a controversial idea; within weeks Youngdahl resigns. The camera observes: Augustana parishioners discuss the idea the social ministry committee meets with Hope leaders and Hope youth talk about race and religion. Ernie Chambers a Negro barber predicts Youngdahl's failure and Chambers' implacable questions help lead Ray Christensen an Augustana social ministry member to a conversion.
