Some businessman of a software company moves to the seashore because his daughter suffers from asthma as her mother did before she died. He doesn't like the villagers and he doesn't want them to hold the Biikenbrennen like every year in front of his new house because it's too dangerous. Biikenbrennen is a fire which prevents the cursed ghost of Wavlew to steal a child as he did in the 15th century to receive all the belongings of the villagers. So fate happens. And the arrogant father has to get his daughter back. Without the help of the villagers.
