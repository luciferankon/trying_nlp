The main character of the film is a 30-year old woman who is making the decision of her life. She is one of the many burnt out performers of the modern day of whom the society expects more and more unrealistic results. Adaption takes place in a Finnish scenery of the mind: the wintry period of darkness.The locales include dark seaside a sauna and a nightly forest. Every now and then our subconscious writes our dreams as cruel horror stories. The self-inflicted fear we face there is near to the core of the film Adaption. The powerful sense of panic creates a strong atmosphere to the film. The desire for death and the horror of death are beautiful in their gruesomeness. There is a strong presence of otherness which is being visualized as transitions from one time and era to another. The displacement between the reality and the dream or fantasy can also be interpreted as some kind of an inter-generational Déja vů phenomenon. On the other hand it depicts the working of a suicidal mind; the sense of ones existence is being shaken up and the mind and the personality are overwhelmed by the incontrollable otherness.
