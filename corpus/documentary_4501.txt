This film follows 18 Americans Jews to Israel and Palestine as they seek to understand what life is like in the Occupied Territories and in East Jerusalem. The journey becomes an intense encounter not only with the people they meet but also with their own preconceptions - an experience that for many of the travelers is transformative.
