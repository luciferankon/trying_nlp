A feature-length documentary exploring the new music and social phenomenon of chanting that focuses on the everyday people who are finding healing and a sense of inner peace by singing mantras together with others just like them; it also features the artists who are the focus of this new music-based movement. It's a film about spirituality not religion it's about people reconnecting with their true selves and with others.
