It is present day in Arkham Heights a seemingly desolate town that has decayed much since the eighties. Renny Meeks (MERK HARBOUR) is a lonely mentally challenged man with an IQ of 78 who sacks groceries at a small store. He's a simple man recently released from an institution for a crime he was accused of that rocked the town ten years ago.
