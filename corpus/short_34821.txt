Alyssa has no luck with the opposite sex. One boyfriend after the other has dumped her. According to the advice of her best friend Jodie there are only two solutions to the problem: killing all the ex-boyfriends or looking for professional help. So Alyssa takes on counselling. The young analyst Michael initially finds it difficult to determine the cause of Alyssa≈ês problem - but he is intreagued with his new patient. Since Michael seems to be clueless how men and women live together - or apart - in today's world and Alyssa doesn't dare to socialise without a protector they agree to an unusual therapy approach: Michael takes out Alyssa to teach her to enjoy life again strictly as a professional exercise of course... Michael and Alyssa get along well - actually too well. But at one of their "professional dates" she bumps into one of her ex-boyfriends and all the bad memories come flooding back. Michael urges Alyssa to rid herself from the demons of her past an advice she takes on literally: With increasingly inventive methods she kills off her boyfriends one after the other.
