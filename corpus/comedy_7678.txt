Dennis is a German actor who had come to the UK to study. Now he is one of the many daily Pontardawe - Swansea commuters making a living in IT support while waiting for his acting career to take off. His best mate Conal is an Australian musician who came to the UK for a bit of a good time and got stuck teaching golf at the local club. When Dennis gets offered an audition for a small feature in North Germany Conal decides it is time to test drive the Simsons Dennis had so lovingly restored over the past year. They set out on a road trip to remember.
