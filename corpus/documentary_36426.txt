Texas January 2001. George W. Bush is on the way to begin his functions as president of the United States of America. A group of children pray for the future president. In the House of Representatives one discusses the appropriateness of the sentences of life without parole as as possible alternative to the death penalty... All started with a figure: 2.3 million dollars the purported price of carrying out the death penalty from the time of sentence until execution. This sum is three times more than that necessary to condemn a person to life in prison. What are the reasons for such a high cost? What is the economy of the death penalty? Officials lawyers and prosecutors attempt to answer these questions. They are mixed up contradicted irritated and finally end up ready to talk to the camera.
