We see them practicing and in concert; both talk about their early careers. On hand with Lord Kitchener are Lord Pretender and Growling Tiger. Lord Kitchener looks back on London in the late 40s when he and calypso rose to international popularity. Fifteen years later he returned to Trinidad taking a year to re-establish his popularity. Intercut with scenes from Trinidad's Carnival younger singers compete in an annual singing contest as Lord Kitchener serves as MC.
