Adrian is a child prodigy who has social acceptance issues and just wants to fit in. The young boy combines his need for acceptance with his love of science to create a Robot and that is when the fun begins. The film is a live action children's book that was created as a homage to 1950's Robot films French New Wave and Italian Neo-Realism. The production had the micro-budget of $100.00 one camera and only two lenses. This film also marks the feature length debut for writer/director R.E. Paris as well.
