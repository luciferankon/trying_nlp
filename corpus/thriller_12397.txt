Each of the members of a group of hackers is willing to fight against system. Their messages and attacks are political socially demmanding but also playful. Each of them have reasons to have moved to that virtual side where they can be who they can't in real life. However the sudden implication of authorities (pressed by goverment to be tougher against hackers)and of a wise and dangerous cracker will cause a turn in their crusade. Will they use the enemy's means or their ideological motivations imply a respect for law and human life?
