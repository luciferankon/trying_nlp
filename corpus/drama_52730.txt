When God created man he sent a group of angels known as 'the watchers' to observer mankind however the watchers mated with the daughters of man against Gods wishes. This resulted in the nephilim being created who's only goal is to rule. Taught in forbidden arts the nephilim rose quickly to power and continue to live amongst us. They feed off society without giving anything in return. Can he angelology society stop the nephilim from dominating the world?
