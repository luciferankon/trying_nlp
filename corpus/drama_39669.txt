Appropriately named "Zoo" the film represents how some just happen to live a wild life. Based in Newark New Jersey Terrance "Mustaffa" Dent was a straight laced teenager until he discovered how easily money could be obtained in the streets. His love of easy money led him to become the founder and leader of a drug ring called "Zoo Crew" which laundered drug money throughout a slew of businesses all over the city. The movie differs from other gangster movies as the main character starts to see how he could actually do good in the community instead of potentially destroying it. The film represents a man's inner struggle from both sides of the good vs. evil spectrum.
