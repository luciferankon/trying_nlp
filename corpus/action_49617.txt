This simulation invites players to experience the thrills and frustrations of being the head of Television Programming for a major network. You alone or with another player compete against the computer as each controls one of the "big three" networks. Purchase and schedule new shows adjust to weekly ratings and try to recover from your mistakes at the end of each 13-week "sweep." The objective is to maximize your network's profit through superior ratings and shrewd judgment.
