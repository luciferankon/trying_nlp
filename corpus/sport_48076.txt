George Plimpton becomes quarterback for the Baltimore Colts on "Plimpton! The Great Quarterback Sneak" a one-hour documentary. The author whose original donning of pads was recounted in his book "Paper Lion" joins Colt veterans John Unitas Tom Matte and John Mackey for a in-depth look into professional football training camps. He also gets his chance to exact "revenge" on his old Detroit Lion friends - like Alex Karras - in a pre-season exhibition game.
