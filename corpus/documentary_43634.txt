Switzerland. After 54 years of mountain farming Robert Guillet is probably living his last season on his mountain pasture. The old mountain cheese-maker has no more land nor cattle to leave to his son Beno√Æt. After more than a year of filming the Guillet family Hugues de Wurstemberger and Didier Schmutz propose a reflection on the future of the craftsmen of the Swiss mountain pastures. Is there still a future for mountain and hill farming?
