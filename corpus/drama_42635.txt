When one man (Graf) terrorizes a town and its citizens they join together to take 'care' of him. A special prosecutor (Bruce Boxleitner) is brought in to find the guilty person. Raymond is a ruffian who picked on everyone in his town. He would eventually get caught and get locked up. But now he's out and most of the town are worried. Robert the D.A. says that if he breaks the law he'll lock him up. But when Raymond turns up dead Robert wants to know who killed him but everyone doesn't think he's worth it. But Robert persists which makes him a pariah.
