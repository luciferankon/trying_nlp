February 1978. After several months of hard work celebrations and complaints the satirical magazine Il Sale suddenly closed down. In a trattoria at Campo de' Fiori Pino Zac announced: "the publisher wants rid of me but you lot have to stay". But the editorial staff was in no doubt: "it's us that make the magazine". Then came the launch of Il Male a magazine alone in its intent to counter attempts by official media to sanctify Aldo Moro. Pino Zac was not just its editor-in-chief fresh from Canard Enchaîné he was also a guiding light a talent scout inaugurating a new season of Italian satire that has resisted until the present day. Pino Zac was an illustrator born in Trapani and the director of the film The Nonexistent Knight based on the book by Italo Calvino who chose to settle in Abruzzo returning to the area whenever work commitments allowed. February 2014. Everything remains untouched covered by a silent shroud of dust at Zac's home-studio at Fontecchio since he died of a heart attack in 1985 at the age of 55. A perfect metaphor for the shameful neglect of his art. Pino Zac was director (Lion at Venice Oscar nominated) actor and one of Europe's masters of satire (Le Canard Enchaîné in France Il MALE in Italy) too awkward always against whoever was in power. Pino has been desaparecido for 30years.
