SundanceTV has asked a handful of our notable friends to tell their Single Story -- a story of a pivotal moment in their lives and the wisdom they've gleaned from the experience. Available exclusively online our visionaries weigh in on those pivotal moments from the perspective of the body of work they've gone on to produce. They identify that nugget of wisdom -sometimes highly nuanced sometimes simple and blunt - that made all the difference in the years that followed. The lesson is clear: Don't underestimate everyday moments. Respect them. Celebrate them. Because it's only in retrospect that we can grasp their impact.
