Occurrence At Lookout Rock establishes a seamless mise-en-scene of the Western genre. Four women inhabit archetypical Western characters (The Lady Saloon Girl Cowgirl and Outlaw) without having a direct function. These characters and the appropriated Spaghetti Western music produce a set of narrative expectations and tension based on the viewers' cinematic imagination and history. This sense of anticipation continues to unfold until the gaze of the four women and the pan to their eventual mysterious disappearance confronts the viewer.
