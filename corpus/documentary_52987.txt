Blue Parrot Entertainment LLC. and Focus Productions Inc. present a documentary on the greatest American hero's around; the firefighters who came to the rescue on the worst day in history and lived to tell the tale. Brothers in Blue is an in-depth look at the firefighters of Northern New Jersey who braved the worst on September 11th 2001 and came to the rescue of hundreds of thousands of people from the burning World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. No one has ever had to handle such a cataclysmic attack on American soil. No one has ever seen such bloodshed or horrific events plague the strongest nation on earth. However while the buildings burned and thousands lost their lives the Brothers in Blue were right there helping every step of the way trying to save as many people as they could and helping their co-workers in the process. The news media of New York never really touched on the fact that so many departments from New Jersey came over the Hudson to reach out. Well this documentary sheds plenty of light on this fact and how New Jersey assisted the rescue effort by manning the firehouses of New York when the rest of their teams were up in the Trade Centers.
