This SARS-inspired drama filmed in Singapore tells of the bravery and selfless spirit of healthcare workers in the medical sector in the fight against the spread of the SARS virus during its outbreak in Singapore in March-April 2003. Fann Wong stars as a selfless female doctor who ends up getting infected herself because of her devotion to her work. The drama shows how Singaporeans unite together to wage a war against SARS. Besides saluting the bravery of those on the frontline it also features some Singaporeans who add "kia-sars" (afraid of SARS) to their "kiasu" and "kiasi" behaviour as well as irresponsible ones who think nothing of going on holidays to high-risk areas or walking around with the SARS virus. The message: we should be calm in face of crisis and recognise the importance of family solidarity and human relationships.
