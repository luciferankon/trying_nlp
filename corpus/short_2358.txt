Mark (Joseph Hernandez) is a high school student who has recently moved with his Uncle Larry (John Hannen) due to the tragic death of his parents (Mario Rocha Tonja Hatman). He uses his journal as a way to cope with his feelings and emotions throughout the first days he is there. Mark is excited for his high school football tryouts as he ventures to strive for his dad's dream for him. Uncle Larry wants him to get into farming as the Orange Trees his mother was harvesting at the time of her death are still there. Mark is confronted by a man who edges him on to take prescription drugs not once but twice after Mark wakes up late the morning of the tryouts and ultimately misses them. As the man who is know as the drug dealer (Jason B. Pace) confronts him a second time Mark buys the drugs and returns home where he chases it down with a bottle of vodka. Uncle Larry finds him and takes him out to make sure he knows the value of life. Mark ends with his journal writing that "Life is a journey that's made easier when you have someone to depend on. I am lucky to have him." As he learns his lesson Mark walks off into the sun and the Oranges bring out the meaning and that Mark has indeed grown.
