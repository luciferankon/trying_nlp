Host Brendan Higgins takes a look at the money Congress has been wasting on eradicating the Brown Tree Snake in Guam. The viewer is shown that Guam is a 22 hour flight away from the closest city in the U.S. The viewer is shown how Guam became a territory of the U.S. and how brown tree snakes are in fact a real problem. Then the viewer is shown how the hundreds of millions of dollars have done absolutely nothing to even remotely curb the snakes' proliferation. The remainder of the show explains how "Wasted America" hopes to change things in Washington by entertaining people into being educated.
