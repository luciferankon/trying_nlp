Sar..rr..ra [English Title: The Joy Run] is about mud football in the rainy season. Such excitement is not to be found in any other game. If there had been a ranking of the emotion evolving around football India and specially Bengal would have topped the list. Bits of interviews from the fun-footballers along with a fast soundtrack consisting of Indian instruments mostly percussion set the playful mood. Forgetting the constraints of rules and regulations fun stands supreme in the fields. What is needed is just a piece of land/a patch of land. Throughout the rainy season fun football is played in the cities and villages. The joy of playing football in the rain - the fun and excitement is the subject of this film. Suddenly the rain comes and Street Maradonas of Kolkata hit the fields in their 'Joy-Run'.
