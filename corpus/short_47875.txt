Two robbers are chased by policemen and are finally traced to a mill. In their escape they slide down the chute of a cutting machine and are dismembered. The policemen finding the various parts of their bodies hit upon a bright idea of reversing the cutting machine they therefore pack the remains into the hopper; whereupon the parts are restored into natural shape and their capture results.
