In the background three accompanists stand one beating a tambourine another playing a flute and the third (only partially visible) clapping. In the foreground Princess Ali dressed in North African clothes and waving a scarf in each hand dances; after a slow turn she lays the scarves on her shoulders faces the camera and undulates. Then rhythmically she turns again.
