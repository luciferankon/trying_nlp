Made for German television in 1972 this rare film documents Anima-Sound (duo Limpe and Paul Fuchs) as they caravan across Europe in a homemade trailer pulled by a tractor intermittently setting up outdoor performances for (often bewildered) bystanders. The film simultaneously captures the nascent counter cultural energies of post-1968 Germany detectable in the Fuchs' otherworldly improvisations and the day-to-day of living on the road as the couple tends to their two young children.
