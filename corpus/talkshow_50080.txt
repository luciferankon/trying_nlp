After The Climb is a four part mini-series that allows us to meet the climbers associated with the Discovery series "Everest: Beyond the Limit." The show is hosted by Phil Keoghan (Amazing Race) and in addition to the many series regulars it also introduces some of the greatest Everest mountaineers alive. Thie scene is set in an upscale lodge where the climbers sit around the hearth and talk about the challenges involved in tackling the highest mountain in the world.
