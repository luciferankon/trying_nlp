Music and fashion collide. Yesi Ortiz is hanging with rapper Tyga in his Last Kings clothing shop. Then LaLa Romero adds retro style to her Pretty Brown Sound. Plus Hudson in concert and League of Starz. EDM takes center stage. Anthony Valadez is spinning with Baths at the Natural History Museum and Swedish Egil sits down for an amazing interview. Plus a Deconstruction of 'Dead and Gone' and NFL star Walter Thurmond. Mike Catherwood and Nina Terrero host.
