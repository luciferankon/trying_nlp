FOREIGN STUFF is a portrait of Sassi di Matera in southern Italy an almost forgotten labyrinthine town dug into the cliffs that has existed since Classical times and is nearly uninhabited today. Pasolini created "The Gospel according to St. Matthew" in the Sassi in 1964 and was inspired by this unique place. Encounters with Sara Vito and Ralf who still live in the Sassi. Ralf is a sculpturist specialized in tuff stone craftsmanship. He rebuilds tuff stone houses in balance with nature. Vito was born in a cave...but in 1953 Sassi were highly overpopulated and evacuated. A surprise with the bewitching music of an Apulian singer. What will happen to this town in the future?
