The introductory scene shows us the typical abode of the hunter in the mountain district and the affectionate leave-taking of the hunters as they start out upon their mission We follow them as they scale the cliffs and ford the mountain torrents carrying with them guns ammunition ropes and other necessary equipment. Reaching a summit they scan the mountain side with the aid of a telescope in the search of game and sighting a mountain goat they are about to dispatch him when the animal moves out of range in the protection of a sheltering border all unawares of the respite to life the gods had meted out to it This necessitates a hurried scampering over more dangerous cliffs and down precipitous declines until they are again afforded a favorable position from which to pluck off their prey. The unerring aim of the hunter is awarded and we can see the goat peacefully feeding on the mountain side and entirely oblivious to the danger to which it is exposed fall and roll down from precipice to precipice. The hunters are now seen scurrying along in their anxiety not to lose sight of their prize regardless of the dangers to which they are exposing themselves. By means of a rope one of the men is let down to the ledge on which the carcass of the goat is found resting. After properly fastening the rope to the feet of the animal he deftly climbs the rope to a place of safety and now the prize is drawn up where it is fastened to a long pole and borne upon the shoulders of the men the homeward journey is undertaken. Evening has now set in and in the moonlight they stride along with careful and steady step proud of the success of their day's labor. Reaching home the game is conspicuously displayed to the admiring gaze of the mistress who compliments her spouse very affectionately upon his prowess.
