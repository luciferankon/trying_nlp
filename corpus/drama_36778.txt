The events take place in a small Albanian village around the 1930s. This isolated land dominated by rituals and patriarchal relationships is the spirit that welcomes the newborn child of Abas. Servet a co-villager emigrant in the United States of America comes back in his homeland bringing a new vision and a new mentality which serves as an inspiration for the 10 years old boy Gjoleka the son of Abas. Gjoleka founds himself in between of the ideas of his wild father Abas and his godfather Servet. Gjoleka symbolizes the young generation in the difficult realities that offer small and underdeveloped countries where the outside world constitutes an irresistible attraction. The movie shows with a deep realism the human relationships such as love jalousie hate the impossibility to be integrated with another world making this way a cruel autopsy of the weird society to which "sometime" we belong.
