A gifted but blocked composer Randy is struggling to write a song for his idol rock star Russ Calvin. When Randy's girlfriend Sara gets him a meeting with Calvin Randy comes unprepared. Predictably he is curtly dismissed by Calvin. Outside the recording studio Sara lets him have it: "You are your own worst enemy!" AND THEN THE REAL NIGHTMARES BEGIN.

The result: he finally finishes the elusive song changing Calvin's life as well as his own.
