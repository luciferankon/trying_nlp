The Wanderer is the story of Gregor Samsa a fumbling scruffy hero who flees his parents' African hairdresser with his lover Betty. But tragedy confusion and a motley set of characters await. Adapted from a translation of Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis by artist Rory Macbeth (who doesn't read German) this lurid sticky and mischievous plot shadows Gregor and Betty as they fall in and out of love.
