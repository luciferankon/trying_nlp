Based on true events. In the spring of 2011 Drew Evans disappeared without a trace. Many people claimed he was dead. Though in 2012 Drew announced it was a lie. Yet something eerie was looming on the horizon. Fate it seemed was not without a sense of irony. In May of 2012 Rocky Baleen Drew's childhood friend and martial arts mentor discovered a frightening news article while searching Google - Drew Evans had committed suicide in the early morning hours of May 21st 2012. Yet to Roc something seemed amiss. What Roc didn't know was that Drew had been watching him and waiting for the perfect moment to unveil to him just what was really going on. Yet unsure of Roc's loyalty Drew was hesitant to approach him and confide in Roc his reason for such cruel trickery. While trying to make sense of the madness engulfing his world Roc is approached by a young girl named Kia. Kia has no ties to Drew's past or the people that he longs to forget though strangely seems to be the only one with answers. On a cold winter's night Kia hands Roc an ominous note. A note Roc can't ignore. A few days later Drew and Roc reunite. What happens next no one will ever forget.
