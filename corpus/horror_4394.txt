After living through some tragic events a rock band composed by twenty-year-old immerse themselves in a conceptual project that winds-up becoming a three track album that deals largely with their guilts fears and traumas. Each song has the distinctive quality of including the most heart-wrenching incidents lived by the band members who wish to purify their darkest moments through their music. Within this framework the band decides to withdraw to a far away grotto to record the videos that will accompany their record. Once there they unwisely trespass into an abandoned gold-mine where they discover an idol made of stone: it is an ancient diabolical representation used by the Spanish conquerors to frighten and subdue the natives and their local god. Having unleashed the spirit of the mine the three youngsters will be unwillingly submerged in a dark and familiar realm: the world created in their record. Now they must fight for survival against the horrors of their past the same horrors they tried to heal and forget but that are now made present in a wild and never ending loop. Narrated in three chapters one for each track and band-member the three stories are spun through terrible acts of violence cruelty and madness.
