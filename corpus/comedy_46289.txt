The frankfurters are already the largest in the country but the manager has put his heart on an additional factory on a farm in the municipality Sonaansee a coastal town that lives off tourism and where sausage rolls can be easily measured. The current occupant of the property is a free bird called the Marquis of Sonaansee. A notary commissioned whether the current occupant is the lawful owner and discovered that he was a descendant of the non-noble branch. They see this as an opportunity to clear the estate.
