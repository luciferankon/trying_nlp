Feeling like the whole world has left him behind Alex storms outside to realize that it actually has. The entire city is rushing past him in fast motion. Dodging his way around zooming pedestrians and oncoming taxis Alex stumbles upon The School for the Motionally Retarded. In class Alex discovers rebel chick Raven (Moennig) and a group of other down-trodden 'slo-mos' who introduce him to the pleasures of being slow: 'No one asks you for change or directions.' But when Alex returns home to find that Chloe wants him back he wishes nothing more than to speed back up and leave this slow new world behind. Can Alex climb back up to speed? Will he win back Chloe? Will he ever write the second page of his novel? Sometimes it takes being a 'slo-mo' to discover the right way to go-go.
