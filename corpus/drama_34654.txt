When an English husband goes off to India for a year-long business trip he also sends his wife to live in Paris to alleviate her loneliness and boredom. While she is there she becomes quite the courtesan and meets a Spanish Don who falls in love with her. When her husband returns to meet her in Paris she finds that the year has changed them both. She is charmed by the Spaniard and duped by him and his conniving valet to come to Spain just to see him for a few days. While there she falls in "love" with him and writes a letter to her husband stating that she is going to leave him for the Spanish gentleman. A few minutes after the letter leaves an old man comes to the estate mad with anger and loss shoots the charmer because he had fathered a child by his 16-year-old daughter and both died in childbirth. With this new-found knowledge our lady frantically returns to her husband who truly loved her all along hoping to stop the letter and save her marriage. Will she be able to intercept the dreaded letter before it gets to him?
