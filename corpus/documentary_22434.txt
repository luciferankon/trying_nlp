Alejandro has been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome the general term for one of the development disorders which make up the family of autism spectrum disorders. To help him integrate more easily into everyday social situations Alejandro attends a special class at the school of Villa de Guadarrama where he shares classes with Nicolas Hector and Kiko each of whom have been diagnosed with a varying degree of this type of autistic spectrum. With an educational methodology specifically designed for them their young teachers try to introduce them to all the codes of communication necessary for making their relationship with the outside world as complete as possible. Though this may all seem strange and obscure to anyone not involved it is a perfectly suitable educational process of unquestionable logopedic worth.
