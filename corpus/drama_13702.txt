Middle-aged artistes provide the focus of this drama filmed in black and white. The story is set in Paris around the time of the Gulf War. Paul is an actor leading a drab directionless existence. He has an affair with Ulrika a woman half his age. His wife with whom he constantly argues is pregnant with their second child. He does not interact much with his teenage son. Much of the film centers around the emptiness of his life.
