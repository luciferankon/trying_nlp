From 1976 to 1983 Argentines lived under a bloody dictatorship. Thirty thousand people disappeared as a consequence of the government's repressive regime among them there were pregnant women forced by the military to give birth in clandestine detention centers. Hijos del Dolor Nietos de la Esperanza (Children of Pain Grandchildren of Hope) is a documentary which retells the story of a group of young people and their grandmothers as they attempt to reconstruct their life story and their family. Until now only seventy-eight out of the four hundred missing children have recovered their true identity and begun to know their other life story. The documentary is a journey towards the somber effects of the state terrorism practiced in the past and the sequels which to this date affects our society.
