Olga Nenya is raising sixteen black children in Ukraine where 99.9% of the population is white and where race DOES matter. The reality of growing up as a bi-racial child in Eastern Europe - a rare and truly visible minority - is not for the faint of heart. Forced to constantly defend themselves from racist neighbors and skinheads these children have to be on guard against the world that surrounds them. No one is related by blood in this family but everyone is connected by the color of their skin and by the woman who chose to be their mother. Ukrainians don't lend Olga a hand but Westerners do: a British charity bought them a house and the kids spend their summers with host families in Europe. When a European couple offers to adopt one of the kids Olga refuses despite being aware of what awaits a black Ukrainian beyond the protective shield of her family. This film is a multi-dimensional portrait of one family the country they live in and the bigger world they are a part of. Olga Nenya is as tough as nails and a strong believer in communal responsibility over individual freedom. Though what sets Olga apart from her neighbors in rural Ukraine is the complete absence of racial prejudice. She defies the society that surrounds her by fostering 16 bi-racial orphans abandoned by their Ukrainian mothers. The children's fathers are African students who come to Ukraine to study but soon return home deserting the children as well. Olga refuses to allow these children to grow up in institutions and has collected them all under one roof of her home. The film captures three turbulent years that see her brood of foster children grow into rambunctious teenagers.
