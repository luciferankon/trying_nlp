A soon-to-be-married couple facing a potentially life-altering dilemma. With just two weeks to go before their wedding Faith still hasn't told her fianc√© her deepest secret--that she suffers from sickle-cell anemia. The timing has just never seemed right to come clean about it. Her healthy lifestyle appears to be keeping the disease in check and she's cherished the belief that Norman's love would heal her. But having lost her mother to the disease at age 40 she has no illusions about its destructive potential and doesn't want to put Norman through what her father endured. As the stress of the looming wedding brings on a few painful sickle-cell episodes Faith reacts by pushing Norman away which in turn triggers her sister to tell Norman about her illness. Hurt and angry Faith calls the wedding off and after a heart-to-heart with Faith's father about the responsibility of marrying a partner with an illness even Norman questions his love and commitment to Faith. Can the couple overcome their fears and embrace love with all the sacrifice that entails and move forward with their plans?
