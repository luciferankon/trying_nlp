Made-for-cable Playboy sex comedy about three friends and roommates Carrie Tracy and Ashley who inherit "Insatiable" a luxurious yacht in the Florida Keys from an uncle of one of them. However there's an unpaid loan on the yacht and the shady loan agent wants the yacht for himself. The girls "just" need to pay 10 000 dollars each of the next four months to get it. They try everything to get the money. They go to the bank offer a sexy car wash service play strip poker and even go on a treasure hunt to an uninhabited island where unknown to them a crazy hermit lives. The movie was originally in four parts like a mini-series and it covered a time span of four months. Every part followed the girls' attempt to get the money for that month. However these four parts were reedited for the show's VHS release into two R-rated movies - Soft Touch and Soft Touch II which do not feature explicit nudity or a bondage scene from the series. The unrated version was also released on four VHS tapes as "Birds in Paradise" 123 and 4.
