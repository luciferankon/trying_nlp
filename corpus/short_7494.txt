A young girl is sitting in a room. While she walks on the corridor to ask who wants to play with her she recognizes only old people hanging around the tables. Suddenly a young man arrives. This is a short movie inspired by the fate of the filmmaker's grandmother who got ill with Alzheimers. This little movie tells the story of how different we can see old people and the handling of their illness.
