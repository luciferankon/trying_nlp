Niagara Falls: ultimate symbol of American power beauty. Except these days the American side is suffering from terrible neglect. It's the 99% wrapped in rainbow mist. Three kids inherit a wedding video business. "People don't stay married long enough these days to watch their wedding videos" says the old videographer. "Take my camera." Well their first customer is a bride who wants to get married at the Falls at dawn. Except no one shows up for her wedding not even the groom. Distraught she flings herself over the falls. The kids catch it on film. Word gets around in this desolate town. Soon others are calling. "I got no life no future. I'd like to achieve immortality by proving...my mortality. Jumping over the falls on TV." The kids are horrified. Then they come up with a scheme. Just like reality tv: hold auditions. And tell everyone: you didn't get the part. Get a life instead.
