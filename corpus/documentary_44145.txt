No Way To Heaven begins on a remote island in Southeast Asia. There Fritz Joss a young man from the Swiss mountains has decided to stop eating - once and for all. He plans to find sustenance in pure (sun-)light by applying what is known as the "21-day process". In a manner at once relaxed and almost child-like in its naivety Fritz sets off on his endeavour but the planned conversion to "breatharianism" is much more difficult than anticipated.
