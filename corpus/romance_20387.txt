Todd is not the average late twenties city living guy. His friends are throwing him a very informal celebration for finishing his Phd at their favorite drinking hole when Todd's world gets flipped upside down upon meeting Shellie Rachel's long time friend that is in the city for an extended visit. The two obviously feel the attraction but seem to both have unresolved issues as they both wonder if "Soul Mates" really do exist.
