Then he under his real name of Mark Drummond and his then girlfriend Jamie Butler had rented a single engine plane to fly from Portland to Las Vegas to elope as three of their four parents disapproved of them getting married largely due to class differences. Mark at the time was floundering in life trying to figure out what to do with no savings. Mark and Jamie ended up stealing $200000 of Mrs. Butler's money with every intention of paying it back when they could. However in a raging storm their plane crashed in a lake en route the wreckage and bodies never having been found. Mark absconded with the money to start a new life leaving Jamie strapped in the plane to die at the bottom of the lake. As Mark goes about enacting a plan to get a matching family member kidney he is unaware that his police officer brother now Detective David Drummond has not let the case die believing possibly that Mark and Jamie could be alive as the bodies were never recovered. Mark is also unaware of other things that happened that fateful day at the lake... Jamie who also escapes drowning winds up in Boca Raton. It is not clear why she did not go home or try to find her fiancé. Who she saw taking the money. But eventually confronts him and nearly becomes a victim as the fiancé needs to cover up his crimes.
