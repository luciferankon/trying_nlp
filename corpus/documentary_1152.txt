Learn Why the Western World Is Fascinated by Shamans - Every year thousands of pilgrims from the Western world have sought to learn this knowledge and receive the rituals from the linage of the ancient elders of the High Andes. Many western "shaman" schools in the United States and Europe now train men and women to become shamans by receiving these sacred rites called the Munay Ki. Meet the Shamans of the High Andes - In the film we will journey to the source of Shamanism in Peru the indigenous Q'ero tribe located in the High Andes mountain region. The Q'ero are the last of the Incas - a tribe of 600 who sought refuge at altitudes above 14000 feet in order to escape the conquering conquistadors. For 500 years the Q'ero elders have preserved a sacred prophecy of a great change or "pachacuti" in which the world would be turned right-side-up harmony and order would be restored and chaos and disorder ended. The Q'ero have served as the caretakers of the rites and prophecies of their Inca ancestors.
