After the tragic death of her daughter Mensah the matriarch must lead her young son and her herd to safety. This epic journey will take them across an arid desert past mud swamps a valley of dust storms and beyond the lion gatekeepers of a forbidden kingdom into the herds' ancient feeding grounds in the Okavango Delta. A journey Mensah was once shown as a youngster passed down from her mother and her grandmother. The route they will follow is an ancient one etched in elephant memory that stitches waterhole to waterhole in an invisible map across the dry lands. However if Mensah loses her way her herd could all die of thirst or worse.
