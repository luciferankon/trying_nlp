Musician and Kat Onoma band leader until 2004 Rodolphe Berger lives as if he had nine lives. He's had many determining if paradoxical meetings with artists or fameless and workless characters to the point of sabotaging himself sometimes. He kept on going no matter what transfiguring rock music mixing his own intimate story with some history of music a story of people with a story of places. He kept going towards a destination he didn't necessarily want to know about. We only know where his home bases are: Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines Paris Batz Island. We only know that it all stems from something - that his personal path took him from philosophy to music.
