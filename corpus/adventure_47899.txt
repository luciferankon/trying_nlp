In the Dark Ages a simple bookseller discovers a cryptic text which holds the key to eternal life. But to unlock its secrets he and his friends must quest across a plague ridden war torn country and evade a dark order of Knights in hot pursuit...while that same bookseller must also evade dangerous men in present day America as he (now 600 years older) tries to find a new alchemist to take his place.
