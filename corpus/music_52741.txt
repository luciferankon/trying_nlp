Bocelli performs ten songs around a loose structure. After the hurly-burly of a metropolitan concert he longs for the quiet of his rural seaside home in Tuscany. He returns singing on location; as he sings he remembers his childhood particularly his relationship with his playful and attentive father and his joy around horses. He also recalls or imagines an afternoon of lovemaking in an isolated villa. Time in the studio recording "L'Abitudine" with Helena and time at home with his two sons round out this portrait of a native son.
