The Zeno Supper Club is a social experiment to see what happens when you bring interesting people together with food drink and a creative environment. Through webisodes that are based on cooking lessons with "Top Chef" Lee Anne Wong the Zeno Supper Club explores broader themes like environmental activism buying local living in a sustainable community and alternative transportation.
