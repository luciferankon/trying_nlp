It had long been believed that only 15 minutes of film footage exists of the legendary final game in the 1954 World Cup. Other segments of the sensational game have never been reconstructed - until now. After extensive research in film archives all around the globe it is now possible for the first time to present 40 minutes of the gripping emotional game - in conjunction with the legendary radio commentary by reporter Herbert Zimmermann. Instead of brief isolated film extracts the course of the game can now be followed over much longer segments. Previously unreleased footage demonstrates the masterly ball control of the German players while shots at goal from the Hungarians - never before seen on film - prove that the German goalkeeper Toni Turek really was a "football God". Now it is possible to see the final German goal in the 3:2 victory from five different perspectives. It is a sensational experience to watch the unique color footage of the final which had been thought lost: for the first time all five goals can be seen in color.
