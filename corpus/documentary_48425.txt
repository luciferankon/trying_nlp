Christopher George Latore Wallace AKA the Notorious B.I.G. was murdered on March 9 1997. His killer was never found. Biggie's death has been linked with that of his close friend-turned-enemy Tupac Shakur as part of the ongoing rap war between the East and West Coasts. As an only child without a father his internal demons became evident when realizing his Park Avenue dreams were far from reach with his mother struggling to make ends meet. At age 17 he dropped out of high school and street life became his reality. In this documentary you will get a very in-depth look at his personal life video footage seen only by a select few and underground interviews of the artist never issued to the public. From the cradle to the grave business instead of game. What you don't know now you will know.
