It wasn't done before it is for the first time that we open these particular files from the archives of Communist State Security. There is a video tape enclosed. In 1989 Simon Varsano was interrogated before the camera. Shot in the legs freshly undergone complicated surgery he is lying on a bed in a guarded police hospital. And he answered the questions of the interrogator a State Security officer. The accusation was that the young photographer Varsano has written on the walls. Subject of writings: slogans against the communist totalitarian leader. Tool: "Salamander" shoe polish. It was on the eve of the big political transition. The communist regime in Bulgaria fell in a coup "inside" in the party. Revolution without gunshots. The only person shed blood was Simon Varsano - Recently Simon saved a drowning man and said that he had slept like a baby after that. He admitted the only time he had felt like this was after having written on the walls. What should a man do nowadays to sleep like a baby again? - Simon wouldn't tell about his wounding and arrest about interrogation and investigation. And he would never watch the video film with his questioning. Never until today. A very personal view of author Georgi Tenev on the personal story of Simon Varsano.
