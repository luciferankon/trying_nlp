When a group of Satan worshiping bikers seek out a book holding the secrets of eternal life they accidentally resurrect an ancient evil in the woods that manifests itself in the zombified forms of cult members that killed themselves in the same woods some 200 years ago. Private Investigator Jack Steele while on a mission to help rescue Evelyn Crane's brother Tommy from the hands of the bikers gets entangled in the situation and may be the only one that can lay the curse to rest for good.
