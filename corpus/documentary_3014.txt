This film is the result of 17 years of documenting every aspect of the making of an NFL star DeSean Jackson from Pop Warner to the Pro Bowl... and the rocky journey of a family to stay together through it all despite their differences and in the face of mounting pressure from outside influences. It is a family story wrapped in the fanfare of an NFL dream.
