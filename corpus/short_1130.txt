In 1865 Washington Duke returns home from the Civil War with 50Ë˜ in his pocket and a small patch of tobacco on his land in Durham North Carolina. By 1900 the American Tobacco Company has become the largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the world. For decades Durham is a tobacco town producing brands including Pall Mall and Lucky Strike. But in 1987 the factory closes. The town falls into a spiral of decay and abandonment. In 2004 Capitol Broadcasting reopened the old tobacco factory and ignited the Durham Renaissance the resurgence of a once-powerful town into a leading city of the South.
