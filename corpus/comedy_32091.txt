This series offers quirky vignettes from the eyes of down-and-out actress Candace Benson her best friend Bridgett Dunn and a motley crew of would-be talent all struggling to find success and themselves in Hollywood. Loosely based on Sascha Raeburn's own diary of her time in LA the web-series is a droll world of cheap-refill coffee boisterous banter and amusingly absurd misadventures to make rent and re-invent. Like 'Romi and Michelle' meets 'Ghost World' by way of 'The Office' Lost in LA is a delightfully dysfunctional brew of classic gal-pal comedy and awkward witty humor. Candace Benson has packed up and moved to LA to make it in Hollywood. She and her best friend Bridgett quickly realize it's not what it's cracked up to be.. Further along Candace meets all sorts of misfits that guide her along a shaky path.
