An original production filmed in Mexico "Como Ama Una Mujer" is inspired by the lyrics of Lopez' first Spanish-language album of the same name released earlier this year. At the end of each episode Lopez herself will perform the theme song that inspired that episode. The five part mini-series tells the story of a woman's journey to find her true soul-mate but with her glamorous life and professional success come heartbreak and betrayals that threaten to break her spirit.
