A Standard Story experimental is a dreamlike short film about a girl living a mundane existence in a hotel wakes to find herself in the middle of an enchanted forest. In this alternate universe she goes on a remarkable journey of discovery. It is a wonderfully original and carefully crafted film by a talented director/actress.
