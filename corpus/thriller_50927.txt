To make matters worse Erika's long time ballet coach Leonard Capas has just quit before her important audition into the Ballet America summer program. Mr. Capas' resignation was solely by a cryptic letter with no in-person good-bye to staff or the students.

Reed has been a widower now for eighteen months his wife who was a former ballerina herself.

Through this dating process Deborah has Erika's well being and her audition as a priority. Deborah begins to see some behavior in Reed that somewhat troubles her. Deborah soon realizes that Reed has his own priorities and that almost everything that has happened to the Matthews family of late including Mr. Capas' resignation and Jason's departure was not by accident.
