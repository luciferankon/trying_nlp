In an indictment of the British public school system we follow Mick and his mostly younger friends through a series of indignities and occasionally abuse as any fond feelings toward these schools are destroyed. When Mick and his friends rebel violently the catch phrase "which side would you be on" becomes quite stark. Mick Travis is in his final year at a posh English public school and hates every minute of it. Everyone at the school is bullied - younger students are bullied by older students and the teaching staff bully all of them. Mick hates it - the outdated traditions the beatings from the teachers the silliness of the games they are forced to play. When the opportunity arises MIck and his friends have a surprise for parents and other guests.
