A verit√©-satire The Festival is an ensemble comedy told from the perspective of fictional IFC documentarian Cookie. Cookie's subject: Rufus Marquez a quixotic young director embarking on his virgin voyage to the prestigious Mountain United Film Festival (MUFF.) The Film is The Unreasonable Truth of Butterflies. The goal is a distribution deal. And the pressure is on. Rufus - unprepared for the excess of schmoozing activities - maneuvers an assortment of pretentious filmmakers salivating distributors and smile-for-the-camera festival VIPs. The problem is no one has seen his film - and the more no one sees it the hotter the buzz becomes. As her bosses close in Cookie loses her objectivity and Rufus loses his film - literally - as his masterpiece goes missing.
