This entry in Monogram's "Latham Family Series" finds Barbara Latham ('M'liss McClure' (qv)) the daughter of Henry Latham ('Raymond Walburn' (qv))taking temporary charge of a small flying-school which whets her father's appetite to resume his flying career dormant since the end of World War One. Mayor Colton ('Walter Catlett' (qv)) also a WWI flyer gets the same urge. They make a bet as to which one will make the first solo flight and when Latham wins Colton uses his mayoral influence to get Latham arrested and fined the amount of the wager. Later unknowing to them they take a contract to fly a much-wanted criminal to Las Vegas but forget to refuel the airplane.
