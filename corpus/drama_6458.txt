This film is about relationships. We all have our own take on how things happen. If you ask three people about a certain event you'll get three different descriptions. However if you ask three couples to share the pivotal moments in their relationship they're likely to come up with many of the same memories: first meeting first kiss first major fight etc. In the end every relationship is bound by the same major themes: Courtship Sex Commitment. The rest is a dance... Different partners... Different music... But it's all the same dance.
