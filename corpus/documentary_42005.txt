Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio established the architectural firm of Diller + Scofidio in the late '70's. For fifteen years they focused on performance; collaborations with choreographers writers and directors; and architectural projects realized in an art world setting. Considered among the most "brainy" and unique architectural teams working today their media-based work expands the conventional boundaries of architecture. In this video Diller + Scofidio are in the midst of several substantial building projects such as the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston - which was received with much critical acclaim by the architectural community and several projects in New York City: the development of the High Line the redesign of a part of Lincoln Center and Eyebeam Atelier the museum and educational facility for new technology. Their experimentation with performance and conceptual projects gives their approach to architecture a fresh point of view. The architects take us on a tour of their mid-career retrospective at the Whitney Museum "SCANNING: the aberrant architectures of diller + scofidio". They discuss their ideas and approach. The exhibition presents some of their smaller works including several installations models and concept renderings for larger projects giving insight into the team's design process.
