While people throughout the entire world are aware that our worthy Chinese friends wear their hair closely shaved on their foreheads and in fact as far back as their crowns but few stop to think how the removal of this hair is performed. Shows a Chinese barber commencing and finishing the work of shaving one of his customers who is resting quietly in a large chair with a most contented look on his handsome features. Very amusing.
