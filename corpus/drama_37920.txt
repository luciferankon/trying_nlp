EDEN deals with what could possible be a future for most people caught up in the current economic climate in Ireland and how we have taken a bite of the financial apple and borrowed beyond our means. We follow Adam who has been left unemployed and homeless throughout one of his days on the streets and the people and situations he finds himself in on a daily basis.
