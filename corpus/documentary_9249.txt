Shot entirely on location amidst the condo towers of downtown Toronto Canada Jump is a personal exploration of the underground sport of base-jumping low altitude dropping from a fixed object. The film follows one aficionado waiter by day base-jumper by night and the two friends who share his passion. Through their eyes Jump examines our perceptions of risk and danger considers the issues of legality and of having only one parachute and explores the notion of meditation through heart-stopping free-fall. Jump also offers a unique perspective on living and finding adventure in an urban landscape.
