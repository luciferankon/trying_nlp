Charlie and Emily Mustgrave appear to enjoy an idyllic existence together in the foothills above San Francisco Bay. At first glance life seems pristine for the two and their 11 year old son David. Upon closer inspection from David's perspective life is anything but pristine. Placed squarely in the middle of a deeply emotional and psychological battle that rages between his parents David questions his perceptions and allegiances on a daily basis. Is it "Mother" who is sick? Or "Father"? Or both? When David's grandfather passes the family moves to his secluded mountaintop estate to prepare it and it's contents for auction. Further isolated from the world David can only watch as the conflict between his parents intensifies and begins to spiral out of control. David is forced to choose which parent to trust- if he can trust either of them. Chased by both parents throughout the estate David is thrust into a deadly game of hide-n-seek uncovering family secrets and disturbing revelations along the way.
