Tom Bain was born with a tongue so glib that his parents early in his career predicted he would be a second Chauncey Depew. In college it developed until he was capable of selling Liberty Bonds in a poor house. But Tom was ambitious to be an inventor and so built a tunneling machine that "would start at one side of a mountain and propel itself through to the other without man's assistance." His gift of gab sold the rights to the machine to a big manufacturing firm but they soon found it worthless and instead of building machines Tom was placed on the payroll as a salesman. And then after an exciting series of adventures Tom finally wins the hand of Peggy whom he had met and courted in his college days. The wedding occurs in a hospital where the couple meet accidentally as patients.
