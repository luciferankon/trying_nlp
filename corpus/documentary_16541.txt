Back on 30 August 1997 when Princess Diana was killed in her Mercedes limo as it was driven through the streets of Paris detective Colin McLaren was at home in Australia. At that time he was a lecturer at the highly regarded Detective Training School in Australia teaching crime scene procedures. he watched the news of the death of Lady Diana and couldn't believe how shabbily the French Police were treating the crime scene. Within a few hours it was swept up and hosed down and the street was opened up to traffic again despite seven paparazzi being charged with manslaughter. McLaren was incensed. So he jumped a plane to Paris to undergo his own CSI. As soon as he arrived there he located tire skid markings tire rubber residue and many scratches and gouges that were all obviously part of the collision that killed Diana and her lover and her driver. He photographed everything and measured everything. The documentary Princess Diana's Death: Mystery Solved follows McLaren through the evidence he discovered and outlines his reasons for how Diana was killed. It also exposes a cover-up by the French Police who hid facts about the tragic accident such as the details of a driver and his car that slammed into Diana seconds before Diana slammed into the tunnel wall and died. McLaren goes on to prove worrying aspects of the accident and disprove many of the conspiracy theories associated with the tragedy.
