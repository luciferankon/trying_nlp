L'Ange du Bizarre is a junk store where a well-kept gentleman sells little by little all the art objects decorating his apartment. The money he thus gets helps him maintain a ritual: day after day he is served by a uniformed waiter. One day the latter finds his master dead in an armchair. He robs him of his remaining possessions goes to the same store selling them little by little and - it goes without saying - appoints a liveried butler to serve him.
