Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall invites different groups of urban dwellers to spend a wholesome week at his new River Cottage HQ living the green life. It's a clash of food cultures as fast food-loving and convenience-obsessed non-cooks come to Hugh's farm for a taste of the River Cottage "grow your own" philosophy. Hugh's mission of course is to change their ways forever and it's not going to be easy.
