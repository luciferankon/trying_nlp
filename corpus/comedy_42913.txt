Your Mom Says Hi. Is a Sketch Comedy Show starring Best Friends Carlie Mantilla a half Mexican straight girl and Doni Carley a lesbian from Idaho. The show parodies contemporary culture and brings a fresh and unique perspective to the comedy scene. The sketches range from the girls playing themselves (Their Sunday morning routine writing sessions running into Doni's straight ex girlfriend) to characters (Carlie as a spicy Sophia Vergara and Doni as a slightly butch Reese Witherspoon) and even music videos of their own original songs from their hour-long stage show (Camel Toe We're Broke Put Out or Get Out to name a few). Carlie and Doni were named best comedians in L.A. by Los Angeles Magazine and Funny or Die featured their music video "Gangsta Waitress" which has cameos by both Lily Tomlin and Richard Lewis. The girls versatile talent and unmatched chemistry is what makes Your Mom Says Hi. the next big thing.
