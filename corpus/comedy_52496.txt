Warren Adler's 'The War of the Roses' (Michael Douglas Kathleen Turner Danny DeVito) leaped onto the public consciousness and has since remained an essential thread in a wider tapestry of divorce iconography. Now Adler presents us with the chandelier-shattering legacy of Barbara and Jonathan Rose relived in their children Josh and Evie in a hilarious sequel to the original iconic tale about the perils of marriage divorce and the destructive power of materialism. Unlike the legendary Roses Josh's marriage to Victoria should have all the qualities of an everlasting union. But when an innocent caper involving missing Milky Ways catapults out of control at their son's elite private school the pair find themselves entering into a shattering warfare of a different kind.
