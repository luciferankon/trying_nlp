'Aarhus Stories' is the result of an unconventional partnership between film directors and song writers. The song writers' songs replace the traditional manuscript and challenge the director in an entirely new way. The films have all been shot in Aarhus in 24 hours and they all last three to ten minutes. Henrik Ruben Genz the director of the official Danish 2010 Oscar candidate 'Terribly Happy' and local singer/songwriter Poul Krebs join forces in telling this Aarhus Story.
