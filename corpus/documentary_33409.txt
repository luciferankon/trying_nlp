The lives of three teenage boys in a mountain village in India get pinned to each other through the revered deity of their terrain. In a macrocosm evolved out of an ancient belief where the Deity inhabits a few chosen ones the 3 boys in their respective hierarchical roles reflect upon paths that have been laid out for them by the Deity. As they clash in a flight of adolescent aspirations will a coming of age entail harmony or will equilibrium be restored by God's own hand?
