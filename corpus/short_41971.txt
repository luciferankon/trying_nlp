A young blind woman is on a walk down a narrow road when she comes upon a deserted factory. She's well dressed in a black frock and high heels. At the factory an ill-kempt guard challenges her but he's friendly when he discovers she is blind. He walks her to the river and back to the factory then offers to accompany her to the village. She declines saying she is safe enough and able to defend herself. He's doubtful: what if she were to face a knife-wielding attacker? How would she defend herself? Soon he is showing her a self-defense method that involves her lying down on some clean cardboard he's found. What's about to happen?
