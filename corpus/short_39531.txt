A short film / long-form music video by film-makers and brothers Michael and Phil Harrell inspired by the music of Pimalia recording artists 400 Lonely Things. Be Still Life takes its name from the 2009 album by 400 Lonely Things extrapolating the bittersweet interplay suggested in the album title between the constant change of life and the human desire to keep things always as they are. While drawing most of its inspiration and soundtrack from Be Still Life additional songs from the 400 Lonely Things catalog are also used to tell an introspective wordless story. Our weary and withdrawn protagonist is presented with a busted old TV frame and discovers that looking through it - he is able to see the beauty in life again. However taming the outside world comes with a price - he develops a dependence on it that ultimately leads to a chaotic and freeing climax. Be Still Life was filmed and edited December of 2009 - January of 2010 by Michael and Phil Harrell. The albums comprising the soundtrack by 400 Lonely Things are available at 400lonelythings.com and everywhere fine downloads are sold.
