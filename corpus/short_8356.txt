Author Lori R. Lopez takes you to the heart of the forest as she reads a pair of contrasting poems one containing positive emotions and one evoking a dark menacing theme from her collection Poetic Reflections: Keep The Heart Of A Child. The video was filmed at Mount Laguna California by her sons Rafael Lopez and Noel Lopez. Noel composed two strikingly different pieces of music for the score to reflect the opposing perspectives and atmospheres of Lori's verse.
