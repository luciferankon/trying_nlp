Jane and Nick have one thing in common; their poor state of mental health. For Jane contemplating her life's final act - to jump from the cliffs at Beachy Head - has become a regular and routine occurrence. But for Nick what was once nothing more than a thought a suggestion a notion has developed into a journey towards the edge. Jane's frankness and acceptance of her tendency towards suicide have in some ways afforded her some kind of peace. Her pilgrimage to the cliffs at times of crisis bring her clarity and strength and it is this stillness and acceptance that enables her to reach out to Nick despite his initial reticence to engage with her. Once Nick decides to trust Jane he is invited to see things in more rational pragmatic and on occasion illogical terms. But when she leads him to the very edge Nick must decide whether to fall or step back. With his thought process interrupted Nick reaches a fragile truce within himself that may or may not prevent him from returning to finish what he started.
