Inspired by the French film The Red Balloon The Pink Dress chronicles the travels of a very pink bridesmaid's dress. Featuring all original music this silent film was written directed produced and entirely crewed by women. "This is a story about perception. It expresses the subjective nature of art. Everyone has different ideas about what is beautiful and this story pours through the gamut."
