Neither the Bourbon Reforms during colonial times nor the nation's declaration of independence in 1821 made Sonorans feel as if they were Mexican. The state was drawn into the rest of the nation by the railroad and growing demographic shifts during the years of Porfirio Díaz's reign but the Revolution of 1910 would ultimately be the event that definitively integrated Sonora and its inhabitants into the Mexican nation. Sonora would provide the country with political and military leadership headed by leaders such as Álvaro Obregón and Plutarco Elías Calles. They would lead Mexicans from devastation to armed struggle as well as through the nation's first years of economic moral and political reconstruction.
