It's the day before the first of the month and Owen (Ronald Patrick Thompson) needs a roommate. Enter Sunny (Sunil Mishra) a bit of an oddball who maneuvers his way into becoming Owen's roommate more or less without his consent. Meanwhile Oscar (Sotos Petrides) friend of Owen's and lives in a recycling bin doesn't trust Sunny and advises Owen not to let him move in. With no other options and Sunny's cash deposit in hand Sunny moves in the next day and wackiness ensues.
