A group of guys born working-class around 1949 grow up friends playing basketball at the Second Street Park in Brooklyn. Through contemporary interviews and archival footage they look back on their growing up. Teen camaraderie gives way to seeking personal fulfillment and in the 1960s and 70s drug use. As young adults several make a trip across the U.S.; one finds happiness in rural upstate New York. One fights in Vietnam. One is murdered in 1975 probably over drugs. A few become professionals. By 2000 at least two have lost a child there's rue and regret and there's the enjoyment of returning to the basketball court at the park for a reunion game.
