Being raised as an Alb and fed pure Elex to strengthen your body which also stripped you of all emotions your world of cold logic and military discipline were all you knew. Set to rise through the ranks a scourge to your enemies your destiny seemed certain. Now as the smoke rises over the wreckage of your glider in the mountains of Edan you are trapped far from your home Xacor. With no access to pure Elex you are experiencing emotions for the first time in your life. Stranded amongst your enemies and outcast from your people in front of you lies a new and open path as heavily laden with magnificence as it is with ruin. The decisions you make will decide the fate of the world. Magalan - will you be its slayer or its saviour?
