What happens with a person after his death? What does the final destination look like? What happens with our bodies? How are we prepared for our last voyage? A film on how we deal with death. The aging and the decay of the body free of taboos. Death as a part of life and as the last companion. Janos Keser the modern Charon occupation: master of dissecting.
