A few years ago I was having trouble sleeping. One sleepless night I went for a walk to avoid going crazy. Once home again I let my hand at random come to rest on a spine in my bookshelf; I pulled out a slim black volume. It was "The Night". But this time I took the book with me to my armchair by the window and I began to read.
