A group of British tourists visits Poland to take a short practical course in communism. Young guides from the "Crazy Guides" travel agency in Krak√≥w teach them how to milk cows plow fields thresh grain and work with a team of bricklayers. As a reward they get to eat potatoes and drink vodka while the guides recount for them the history of contemporary Poland.
