Last Harvest follows the remarkable journey of an elderly Chinese farming couple as they are being relocated by the government's mammoth and controversial South-to-North Water Diversion Project. Lyrical and intimate the film brings us into the life of two compelling peasants facing major disruption late in life and continues the story where other documentaries left off - after the people have been relocated and have to re-build their lives. If offers a direct experience of the collision between traditional culture and modernization through which we see the imminent extinction of Old China as New China emerges.
