The Director of the film sets off on a journalistic journey which ends up being a personal one. From the Declaration of Independence of Israel to that of Palestine between Jewish and Palestinian underground movements such as Lechi and Hamas. The views reflecting the pastoral landscapes and the suffocating reality is changing like the people who live here. Between hope and despair Yael meets characters of the local mosaic. The son of Salah Shehadeh who was the first casualty of the IDF's targeted killing explains why his cause is just Jewish settlers explain their justification and David 'Hachi Tov' (The Best) claims that everyone is right. The film passes through the clashing points of the conflict and becomes especially unsettling in the Casbah of Hebron where the ground is burning from gas bombs and tear gas and the people whose story Yael come to tell almost lynch the film crew. In Mirrors the similarities between people are shown despite their different narratives.
