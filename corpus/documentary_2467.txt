In the 1970s Adelaide de Menil and Edmund Carpenter bought a 40 acre potato field in East Hampton NY bordered on the south by the Atlantic Ocean and the north by Further Lane. They moved antique buildings to the site and restored them. When the property was sold in 2007 the houses and barns were moved to town center to become the East Hampton Town hall.
