Naranjina is a kids tv series about a girl who lives in the harbor of Rotterdam with her big dog "Dokko". She doen't know where she's from so she named herself by the Oranges of the ship where she fell in as a little baby. These oranges (and ship) are the only way the find out where she's from and where her parents live. In the meantime she experiences all different kind of adventures with her 4 sellected friends "de kadekapers". She lives under the ground in her homemade boathouse where all friends come together and where they plan the next adventure which hopefully will bring her a little-bit closer to the biggest challenge: help Naranjina to find her parents.
