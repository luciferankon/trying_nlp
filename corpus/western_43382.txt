A number of people are waiting for the stage to Laramie. Some are anxious to get there and are willing to bribe the stationmaster for tickets on the sold-out run. When the stage arrives bristling with Cheyenne arrows in it (as well as in the passengers) space becomes available and some brave souls set out on the coach. Attacked by Indians the horses run off the coach is burned and the survivors take refuge in a dry gully. One by one the Indians and the passengers pick each other off until thirst and exhaustion take their toll on the three people left.
