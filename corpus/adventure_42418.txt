A pair of mobsters storm the office of a university professor only to find the professor missing. The trail eventually leads to the waterfront Gas 'n' Charter which has been run by Bwana and Kito ever since they were mysteriously abandoned by their adoptive father. When given the opportunity to help a young woman named Lina the pair jump at the chance as they are seriously behind on their electric bills. Lina is seeking a lost book that may hold the (illegal) secret to reaching "the Underland". Unfortunately their airplane hasn't been flown in years and will need a variety of parts and repairs in order to take off.
