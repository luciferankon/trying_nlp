Brett "SonicBlu" Blumfield is "Jigpaw" a man with an undying urge to teach his harsh lessons in life in the hopes that his victims survive only to learn just how valuable life can really be. Those who fail have no ambition to live and therefore suffer an even worse fate of death. This film started as a series of videos shot with the intention of creating a comical spoof of the Saw movies created by James Wan.
