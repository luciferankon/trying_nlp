Captain Dogwood has been lost at sea and now it's up to his two puppies Tina and Andy. Aided by Salty the Pelican and Echo the Dolphin (and avoiding a nasty gang of cats and a living storm called Typhoon Tessie) they journey on the talking tugboat Little Toot--eventually finding their father and rescuing him from the soon-to-erupt volcanic island Krackaninja!
