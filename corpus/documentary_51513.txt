Very open and very frank the mother (Marjan) sister (Mirjam) father (Fred) former lover (Valerie) an old friend with the same medical condition as Bart (Kees Jan) and via archive audio Bart himself talk about the life and drive of the late TV host founder and former chairman of Dutch public broadcasting association BNN 'Bart de Graaff' (qv). They talk about how he admired comic book hero Tintin and late race car driver 'Ayrton Senna (I)' (qv) about the divorce of his parents and the consequences that divorce had for teenager Bart and about how the arrival of girlfriend Valerie upset his mother. The main theme however is everything Bart had to go through because of his kidney failure and other diseases. Everybody agrees he's a real go-getter or to say it in Dutch a real bikkel.
