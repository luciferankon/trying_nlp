The highly anticipated comic and controversial feature documentary "Flock of Dodos: the evolution-intelligent design circus" is the first feature film to take an even-handed look at the intelligent design vs. evolution clash that appeared on the covers of Time and Newsweek in 2005. Filmmaker scientist surfer and evolutionary biologist Dr. Randy Olson explores the controversy over the teaching of evolution and the recently developed alternative intelligent design. Olson a native of Kansas visits his home state and the community of Dover Pennsylvania which attempted to introduce intelligent design in science classes. Olson draws on basic aspects of evolution as metaphors including the extinct dodo which he suggests symbolizes what happens to those unable to change with their environment. Featured are seven top advocates for intelligent design including Dr. Michael Behe author of "Darwin's Black Box" fourteen evolution Ph.D.'s a poker game among eight evolutionists a rabbit eating its own poop and a flock of animated dodos playing poker dancing and helping the audience answer the question "who really is the 'flock of dodos?'" Though writer/director Randy Olson is a self-proclaimed evolutionist this film truly does treat both sides of the issue with respect. Olson is from Kansas where the Intelligent Design controversy was born and interviews all the major names in Intelligent Design (John Calvert Michael Behe and Jack Cashill to name a few). The genius in Olson's movie is in never settling into a "PBS-style" science documentary. The frame of the film never gets weighted down by boring science lectures or obfuscating intellectuals. The film instead hangs it's hat on hilarious dodo animations slick graphic sequences and a humorous yet honest approach to the whole topic. "Flock of Dodos" will truly have people on both sides of the issue quoting the film in the theater lobby.
