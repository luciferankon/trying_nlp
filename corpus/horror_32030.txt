Two "Men in Black" wannabees (who are not wearing black) are on the look-out for ridding the planet of supernatural beings. After saving a crooked businessman in a warehouse they are surprised by three pretty girls and a leather-jacketed boyfriend who are searching for a party. Evidently they have unwittingly unleashed a kind of portal endangering us all. Our heroes spend the night trying to survive as one of the three women has been targeted as a "breeder." She has apparently been chosen for being pretty tough - after all she does the equivalent of shrugging her shoulders after witnessing her businessman father getting horribly decapitated just inches away.
