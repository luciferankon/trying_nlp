Compassionate generous pious and gentle Meera lives a poor lifestyle in rural Maharashtra along with her widower Bhajan-singing dad Dinkar and a younger brother Rajesh. She devotes her entire life to looking after both of them and after Rajesh completes his education he re-locates to Mumbai meets and falls in love with a movie actress Mohini and gets married to her without seeking blessings from his dad. Since Meera has grown older and is rather plain-looking no one is prepared to marry her. So Rajesh arrives and takes her to live in his palatial house in Mumbai. This is where Meera will find that her status is no one that of a servant and this is where she will be verbally abused slapped and publicly whipped by Mohini and may end up spending the rest of her days as a mere slave to her sister-in-law and her doting mother Shashikala.
