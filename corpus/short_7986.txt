The Philippines 1942. After the Japanese armed forces have invaded the country more and more Filipinos as well as Allied troops have retreated and surrendered to the Imperial Japanese army. A brave few Pedro refuse to give up and instead retaliate. Captured after killing a Japanese sentinel near his village Pedro is taken to the top of a bridge where he is to be hanged for his crime. By a stroke of luck the rope snaps as he is dropped and he falls in to the creek below. He makes a mad dash for freedom which includes jumping over a 4-storey waterfall in escaping his captors. He eventually loses the Japanese's trail and is able to find his wife waiting for him near the ocean. But things are not as they seem.
