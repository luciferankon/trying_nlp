The First Peoples revere nature but are cautious of it because they know of its spirit world protector. They remind their children when the hairs on their arms raise it is the unseen ancient one lurking in every shadow an immense humanoid that stalks then rips the flesh from those who desecrate the earth. This supernatural being known as The Woodsman is eerily similar to scientists' description of Gigantopithecus an extinct genus of ape that existed as recently as one hundred thousand years ago putting it in the same period and place as several hominids perhaps even man's ancestors. In the remote mountains of Northern Alaska the silence is omniscient and menacing but the beast's guttural howl for retribution liquefies your innards and makes blood your run cold. Don't ask if a tree falls in the forest does it make a sound; ask if you're screaming for your life can anyone help? With the visceral feeling of "Predator" and the isolation of "The Thing" this is a horror about repercussions. When there is nowhere to run you make a stand. The mysterious ape called Gigantopithecus blacki has long since vanished from the Earth and so has the early human species. But researchers have determined that the giant ape-which might have been the closest thing to a real King Kong-did in fact live at the same time and in roughly the same place as early humans. Big Mystery A German paleontologist discovered Gigantopithecus in 1935 when he picked up a strange heavy tooth in a Chinese apothecary. It was labeled as a "dragon tooth." When man stumbles across this so called extinct species it comes down to a classic Man VS Beast in this epic tale of survival.
