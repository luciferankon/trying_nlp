Based on the popular ABC television series guests of the Disney/MGM Studios have an opportunity to get into the Hot Seat. Guests are selected by their ability to arrange 4 answers to a question in the correct order and shortest amount of time. They then have to answer 15 multiple choice questions correctly to win increasing amounts of collectible pins & merchandise the largest of which is a family vacation on Disney Cruise Line. Guests in the Hot Seat can choose to use three lifelines: 50/50: two incorrect answers are eliminated; Ask the audience: the studio audience votes on the correct answer; and phone a complete stranger: they can call a passer-by vacationing in a Walt Disney World theme park. In addition special episodes of the network show starring Regis Philbin are taped at the Orlando Who Wants To Be A Millionaire studio several times throughout the year.
