Kenya: Passing the Baton by John Michalczyk (2011 50 min.). Prior to the national election of December 2007 Kenya appeared to be a democratically stable country with a robust economy built upon a highly admired tourism industry. However after the re-election of President Mwai Kibaki his rival Raila Odinga immediately challenged the results and an outburst of violence quickly spread across the country causing 1400 deaths and displacing 300000 people. Kenya: Passing the Baton sheds light on the struggle of a people and a government to create a united civil society currently split by disturbing tribal tensions corruption land distribution and a myriad of social issues exacerbated by the severe drought in 2009. With a new Constitution Kenya wishes to become once again an icon of democracy in East Africa.
