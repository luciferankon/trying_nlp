A day in the European Parliament and surrounding area. This dance film is inspired by the work and lifestyle of the Eurocrats in Brussel's EU district and features five dancers. The characters dance run and glide through the empty spaces in an atmosphere beyond time decontextualized in an architectural non-site.
