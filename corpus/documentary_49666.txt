This program contains much footage of the J-611 steam locomotive in action from the 1950s to today. Norfolk and Western's J-class 4-8-4 steam locomotive number 611 was designed and built in 1950 at the N&W Roanoke shops at a cost of $250000 - equivalent to $2.5 million today. It generates about 5100 horsepower with an 'official' top speed of 110 miles per hour. Wrecked in 1956 and rebuilt it was retired in 1959 when the railroad converted to diesel restored in 1981-1982 as Norfolk Southern's "steam ambassador" for excursion duty retired again in 1993 due to budget constraints and restored once again in 2014-2015 for excursion duty. It has been designated a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark. It is owned by the Virginia Museum of Transportation and based there when not working.
