Photographs of asylum inmates dance with the ghosts of doctors and speak with the spirits of plants in this hybrid documentary that explores the mind's ability to heal from pain. "Singing Was the Only Way Through" uses charcoal and collage animation time-lapse photography and a journey through the grounds of an abandoned psychiatric institution to reflect on a power shared by doctors and artists to mold the meaning of our collective realities. It wonders what we lose when we pathologize the full range of our emotions and yet still fail to alleviate the suffering of those of us in anguish. Are we crazy or do we live in a crazy world? Who has the power to decide?
