Documents the exciting journey of filmmaker Sunil Brij Bhan and his effort to uncover the truth behind "The Disputed Site." Brij Bhan hopes to ultimately gain some semblance of the true nature of the Hindu/Muslim problem and ultimately provide some guidance towards a resolution. However the filmmaker's investigation into the nebulous world of India politics seems to expose more confusion than fact more chaos than conclusion. Ayodhya: The Disputed Site: Is a true story of pride and prejudice. Religious conflict has instigated much of our world's violence throughout history and even today continues to be a very real global problem. The division between Hindu and Muslim is age-old in India. Two world religions both existing for the good of mankind have consistently worked to undermine the other through political maneuvering. The ongoing religious struggle between Hindu and Muslim continues to deepen the divide that separates the people of India. Hindus and Muslims have been fighting in India for over 50 years for ownership of "The Disputed Site" an 80x40 acre parcel of land that serves as a concrete representation of the bloody conflict that continues to gain momentum with no end in sight. To Hindus it was the birthplace of their god. To Muslims it is a site that once honored their great leader. To both it is a matter of principle and neither side is willing to compromise.
