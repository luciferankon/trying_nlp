Two girls escape from an open borstal for two very different reasons; Annetta to attempt to visit her baby daughter who is being raised in a convent; and Carol who hopes to be recaptured and sent to a closed borstal where she knows her girlfriend Doreen is being held. Carol's plan works although she is devastated to find that not only has Doreen found herself a new girlfriend inside (who both taunt and tease Carol) when Annetta is arrested at the convent and sent to the same closed borstal she assumes it was Carol who "grassed" her up and proceeds to plan her revenge. Carol finds protection in the form of inmate Eddie while Annetta's constant bullying attempts keep her in solitary confinement; however Carol's world is turned upside-down when Eddie is released from bortsal and her protection is gone...
