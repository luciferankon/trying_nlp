As global tensions rise the unthinkable threat of nuclear war has become very real--and very frightening. Through the powerful recollections of the survivors of the atomic bombs that leveled two Japanese cities in 1945 this film presents a deeply moving look at the painful legacy of the first--and hopefully last--uses of thermonuclear weapons in war. Directed by Oscar(R)-winning filmmaker Steven Okazaki (1990's 'Days of Waiting') 'White Light Black Rain' provides a comprehensive moving account of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the unique points of view of the people both Japanese and American who were there.
