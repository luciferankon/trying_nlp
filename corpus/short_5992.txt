This deceptively simple tale is about a very old woman played by a centenarian the director met in a cafe whose sons are too preoccupied working in the States to visit her in Mexico. Florencio cuts between men in a truck and the old woman struggling with a pay phone. The film has a textured placidity possibly influenced by the many years the director has spent in Africa.
