Go behind the scenes of media coverage of the West Bank and enter a world where terror is a daily reality. Against the backdrop of this politically tumultuous environment there emerges a deeply layered story of a nation fractured by walls both physical and internalized. A professor of psychology a catholic school English teacher and a political activist discuss the existential dilemmas faced by Palestinian youth as they attempt to develop a sense of self in a land carved by war. Their observations begin to take on new gravity as rare footage takes the viewer deep into the chaos of a military incursion inside a refugee camp. The ending analysis is both surprising and thought provoking as interview subjects grapple to maintain a sense of hope.
