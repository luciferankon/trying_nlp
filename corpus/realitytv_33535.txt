Modern TV. Birthplace of the world's craziest entertainment. And now it's produced a brand new type of thrill seeker - TANKBOY. A licensed arms dealer and pyrotechnic specialist who loves playing with tanks and explosives for fun! The cameras have been rolling on his exploits and a whole new era of madness is about to hit the screen. What happens when a tank drives over a car? What happens when you build your own rocket and fill it with explosives? How about building a gun that fires logs so powerfully they'll go clean through a family sedan?
