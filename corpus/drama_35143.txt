Faced with emptiness and a lack of answers for many problems of the contemporary world sometimes it seems like the only escape is to take refuge in the instincts - instincts that drive us to sex. At least that is the escape for the main characters of this story: sex as an impulse to keep oneself alive to manipulate others as a way to combat impotence and to reaffirm an existence lacerated by loneliness. But the result is fleeting and the attempt has unpredictable consequences. Cuba is economically down-trodden and losing its sense of values. In this state a chemical company run by Nestor (Jorge Perugorria) the "boss" is about to be sold to a foreign interest during which 40 percent of the company staff will be sacked. Bruno (Vladimir Cruz) an overqualified theoretical physicist working as a chemistry lab technician at Bruno's company doesn't want to lose his job during the company buyout; Nestor being the one person who has connections to the "big cheese" outside of Cuba. Nestor alludes to the deal that if Bruno consents to a swingers-like couple swap at the resort his job will be secure. Nestor's wife Christina (Cuca Escribano) a lawyer is open to the idea i.e she "likes everything" as she says. Bruno's wife Magda (Gabriela Griffith) a young art school graduate without much life experience however is ambivalent to the whole thing but eventually gives in. Things "heat" up as various sexual reactions ensue at the end of which things things get "cold" and Bruno looses his wife Magda who says she dies of "disgust".
