In the still of the night on a dark road deep in the gloomy and dense woods a car breaks down. However things will soon take a turn for the worse when out-of-the-blue the beautiful driver will find herself surrounded by a menacing crowd of local farmers where after a short fight the angry peasants will succeed in exacting a humiliating and painful punishment leaving the poor girl stark-naked neatly tied and brutally whipped. Detective Carla Novak is behind the investigation of this hideous crime but before long she too will get herself trapped in a world of masochistic experiences orchestrated by the elusive Fantom Whipper. Without hope or the will to resist Carla will inevitably embrace her newly-acquired addiction to the intense pain and the sinful pleasures of the mighty bull-whip swearing everlasting faith to no one else but her new strict master.
