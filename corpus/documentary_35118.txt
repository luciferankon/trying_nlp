Considered by some to be one of the greatest chemists of the twentieth century Sasha Shulgin is the scientist behind more than 200 psychedelic compounds including MDMA more commonly known as Esctasy. Dr. Shulgin is known in the scientific community as a modern day alchemist and has had a profound impact in society through his work and discoveries. By employing unorthodox methods Shulgin stands apart in the little known field of research in which scientists explore psychedelic substances. 'The Yellow Brick Road' delves into both the world of scientific research done by prominent individuals in the United States and abroad and the lifework of a man many consider The Godfather of psychedelic research and to much to his chagrin 'Dr. X'.
