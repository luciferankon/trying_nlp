Today is the most important day in the lives of Suso and Ricard: after several years in a relationship they're going to get married. Ricard comes from a Catalan family of rancid lineage; Suso from a humble one in La Mancha. Both of their families are delighted with the marriage. Well not all: Adela Suso's grandmother will be present at the dinner but unaware that what's being celebrated is her grandson's wedding day.
