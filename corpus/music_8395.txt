Four girls from Holland are spending the summer of 1923 in a Villa in Italy. When they hear the news that the big estate down the road has been rented to the Baron van Heijendaal two of the girls are boiling over with excitement. They can't wait to meet the prominent Dutch aristocrat and they can't seem to talk about anything else anymore. It leaves the other two more rebellious girls cold but out of lazy entertainment they humor their excitement. When the Baron accidentally overhears the conversation between the four girls in which they talk about him and declare they could always recognize a man of standing he decides to introduce himself as his own chauffeur. Will they recognize him as a man of standing?
