The cinema documentary Kinders follows children and teenagers of different origins through their sometimes difficult and confusing sometimes funny and bitter lives. They all take part in the music education program ((superar)) where these neglected and sometimes invisible children develop from outsiders into confident young people who learn about their hidden potentials through the power of music.
