The life of Moses and the Biblical Exodus is one of the most told stories in human history. No one has ever pinpointed the exact year or even the correct century of these events until now. A new theory claims to have concrete proof of the exact date of the Exodus as well as many other Biblical mysteries revealed. It is a grand tale of miracles and deliverance cemented as the cornerstone of faith for both Judaism and Christianity. This project will explore a new theory seek out the truth told to and from scholars and professors whom are interested in debating the accuracy and validity of the new theory. This may very well become the most talked about documentary of the year. This film engages this conversation regarding a mystery that has perplexed biblical scholars and historians from around the world for thousands of years. How could it be that this historic collision of civilizations cannot be confirmed through the records of Egypt? Did they really happen? Has there been a cover up? Have the stories been somehow misinterpreted or embellished over the passage of time? "Engraved In Stone" challenges the question by asking if we have been looking in the wrong era. The evidence is plainly available but until now no one has been able to put the puzzle pieces together. For the first time we are able to piece together the true time-line of the Hebrew origins and know based on actual Egyptian records plus confirmed in the Bible the true date of the Exodus - 1174 BC.
