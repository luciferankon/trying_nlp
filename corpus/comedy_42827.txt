In a Toronto TV station the newsroom is headed by a ratings freak. There is nothing George won't do! He is surrounded by a self-absorbed news anchor man who is as dumb as they come a grungy trainee and a couple of more down-to-earth producers. The cast is helped by famous guest stars each week who try not to get between George and his bran muffins. "The Newsroom" is presented much like "The Larry Sanders Show" but instead of being behind the scenes at a talk show it is set at - you guessed it - a news room. As a result it is much edgier. The producer and anchors are completely self-absorbed and seem oblivious to the issues they are reporting on. Guest appearances are provided by commentators and interview subjects such as directors and authors rather than actors which is a refreshing change from the constant media bombardment of big names we are used to.
