'BROKEN' Can injury stop an artist? What happens to someone faced with an injury that threatens their ability to pursue their life's passion? An injury to a classical ballet dancer can change everything. Dancers tend to hide their injuries and will push through unbelievable pain to remain the last one standing. In a Darwinian environment where dancers are expendable no sacrifice is too high. The documentary film 'Broken' tells the story of Simone Orlando Ballet BC's lead dancer for 12 years. During the creation of a new ballet Simone suffered an injury that was so severe; she could hardly walk let alone dance. Taking pain killers she tried to hide it from the company and hoped to "just work though it." As Simone struggled to the hang on the results of an MRI came back. The doctor recommended surgery saying "I'm sorry Simone but it's unlikely that you'll ever dance again." She was replaced in the lead role. "All the work and all the years and for it to suddenly just slip away it wasn't acceptable" she says. Even after major hip surgery Simone fought for a chance to come back for the next season. But coming back too soon would have a price and the sacrifice she had to make was much more than she had bargained for. In 'Broken' Simone's heart-wrenching but ultimately inspiring story unfolds through absorbing interviews never-seen-before footage of Ballet BC's work stunningly melded with beautiful stills photography shot by debut director Lynne Spencer.
