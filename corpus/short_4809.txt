Title cards introduce images we watch without narration; they are displays of shape and color. Fran√ßois de Roubaix's electronic music accompanies these images photographed under a polarizing microscope. Some liquids obey the laws of crystallization; we observe those transformations. Sometimes objects flowing other times they change as if in a kaleidoscope. Colors give way to sepia then back to multiple colors. The crystals can look like tiny organisms: small four-part fans share the frame with flowing lines of pink. Multiple patterns appear side by side.
