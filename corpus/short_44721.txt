Gokurosama is the story of one man's ostensibly successful career and untroubled life. Adhering graciously to Japan's grand tradition on unerring loyalty to the Company. The man Kawanaka was a model employee of self-sacrifice and diligence. With little time outside of work to develop personal interests or maintain relationships Kawanaka was content in his belief that such uncompromising devotion would come to fruition in a serene and satisfying retirement.
