The Newlywed Game is among the most enduring game shows of the genre. This 1985 five-day-a-week syndicated revival of the classic game show again hosted by Eubanks sported a new set but with no other notable changes. The rules remained the same as in previous versions four couples each married less than two years answered a series of questions designed to expose how well the spouses knew (or didn't know) each other. The husbands were asked a series of questions while their wives were secluded offstage. The wives returned and answered the same questions; matches were worth 5 points each. As before incorrect answers usually led to full-scale fights and verbal assaults (with Eubanks and the audience not making things any easier). The process was repeated with the wives answering the questions and the husbands herded offstage; questions were now worth 10 points. A final bonus question (usually general first posed to the wives) was worth 25 points. The couple with the highest point total at the end of the game won a bonus prize "chosen especially for" them usually a trip furniture or mode of transportation (other than a car or truck). Reruns of the 1985 version of "The Newlywed Game" as do the show's other versions continue to air on Game Show Network. An updated version of the long-running game show still hosted by veteran host Bob Eubanks. Newlywed husbands and wives would take turns answering (often risque) questions while their spouses were backstage. After answering the spouses would return and be asked the same questions earning points if their answers matched their spouse's. The couple that finished with the most points would win a prize.
