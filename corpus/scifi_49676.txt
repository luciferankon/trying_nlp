The story of Worthy is set in a time where mankind has brought upon themselves the pending destruction of the earths biosphere due to the rapid expansion of technology in their quest for comfort. The argument is made that science is too fractured to understand the global complexity of unbridled progress. Against this setting an alien race calling themselves the Observers have been silently monitoring the progress of humanity since their first primitive radio transmissions in 1907. Seeing the warning signs and the impending doom the Observers decide to rescue a remnant of humanity prior to the destruction of the earths biosphere. This story explores multiple story arcs Jim Swart a special agent and his family Sarah Wayne an astronomer Meta Prime the Commander of the alien race and his crew and life onboard his spaceship Jenny and Dave a pair of siblings who lost their parents to a car crash the day the Observers arrived Vusi a young black man whose parents are overseas at the time and a number of dark characters we will save for later. We explore the collapse of the earths biosphere as a character in its own right and we introduce the menacing and exceedingly dark Archon a mischievous ghost-like being the Observers captured while on route to planet earth. The Archon is inadvertently loosed on earth when an ICBM from an unknown nation tries to shoot down one of the spaceships leading to the possession of a successful CEO who will become Rogan the Conqueror. What if an alien race possessed such insight that they alone were able to save humanity from its own self destruction.
