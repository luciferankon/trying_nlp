Maroso Golfetto is a firm manager from Veneto who is always yelling at his employees all either immigrants or Southern Italians. He regularly appears on the local TV channel where he keeps denouncing the evils of immigration and is very popular with everybody including with kids. His speech hits home better than that of Lucia their anti-racist schoolmistress. And what will be will be : by dint of invoking the help of God to rid Veneto of its immigrants the miracle finally happens : one morning they have all disappeared. But is that really a blessing ?
