Who is given access to the rooms of power? What rules are applicable in the boardroom? 'The Eye Of The Norm' puts light on the lack of variety and diversity in the room of power but is more than a politically correct message in the form of a short film. It also challenges the norms of art and dance as such. The purpose of the dance film is in addition to providing a strong artistic and emotional experience to work towards development and change in regards to participation of people with different abilities in the arts.
