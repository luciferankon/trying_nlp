A long series of unrelated images revolving often distorted: lights flowers nails. A lightboard appears from time to time carrying the news of the day. Then an eye. A woman in a car drives along country roads. Farm animals. She descends from the car again and again. Images: dancing legs seashore swimming fish geometric shapes cut glass. A man removes his starched collar. It rotates. A girl has garishly painted eyes. No she's only fooling. Those were her eyelids.
