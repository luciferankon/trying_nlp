Told from two rotating points of view MUSIE is about the lovable slacker indie-rocker Mags (Bridget Fitzgerald) reconnecting with Susie (Lauren Hunter) an average working Jane who just wants a "normal" roommate. With a supporting cast featuring incredible Upright Citizens Brigade favorites MUSIE is sure to make you laugh as these two opposites figure out how to live together in the big apple.
