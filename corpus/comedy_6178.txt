The show is a free-form free-flow melange of whatever had happened in the last week or so be it the Boss TV take on local issues a press release crashed by the Boss TV team a celebrity stalked and filmed at an event or on their own doorstep. Throw into the mix the regular adult movie film reviews by Emi and Ayami the job swap specials (transexual prostitute swaps with librarian for example) and viewer involvement such as the 'send us your home porn' competition and 'man out on the street' condom give were always a ratings winner.
