There are moments when I feel like stepping into each of their stories says the photographer hired to document construction of a bridge that will connect Victoria with Rosario -- two cities on opposite sides of the Paran√° River in Argentina. But that is a different movie he sighs unaware that his own story will be changed by the lives he touches with his camera. Building the bridge takes years transforming lives on both sides of the river. Two carefree boys grow into teenagers on the river as the bridge takes shape; a mysterious engineer touches the lives of the elderly sisters who rent him a room. The photographer's pictures document the process of change but even he is unprepared for the transformation that only begins when the bridge is complete.
