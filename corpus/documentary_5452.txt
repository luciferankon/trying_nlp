A day spent with Elizabeth Streb reveals the extraordinary possibilities of dance. The dancers almost continually bounce jump fly; rarely do they have their feet on the ground. For Streb action is the message. "The sound of bodies on impact helps bridge the distance from the proscenium stage to the audience seated in their chairs. They come along with us on the ride and interpret what they see for themselves. My intention is to involve them and move them." As the company rehearses Streb explains her philosophy.
