'Leo Donnelly (I)' (qv) in the role of a Broadway columnist who interviews stars celebrities and wannabees and not-yetbees of the era supposedly to set the record straight. Paulette Goddard discusses her engagement/non engagement to Charlie Chaplin; Paul Whiteman tells how he had to lose 100 pounds before he got married and Harry Thaw and Evelyn Nesbit - the Girl in the Red Velvet Swing - tell him what is happening in their lives in December of 1932. Leo then digs up archive footage featuring Gloria Swanson's four husbands...one at a time.
