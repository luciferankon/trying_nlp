Oye is a biography that journeys through the 90's cultural revival and redefined what we know as brand new old school. The B-Boy scene was a commemoration of a new-found identity in a very experimental form of movement. Miami played a huge role as the cultural landscape in which the B-boy scene sparked an evolution and revolution of dance. This film sheds different light on a different aspect of Miami history a history not rife with stories of drug infiltration corrupt politics and superficiality but one of new found identity experimental expression and morays that helped build our Graffiti and B-Boy Culture. By reclaiming that history OYE explores a city in the midst of change a clash of cultures races religions and traditions and during the height of violent gang wars. OYE tells the story of how the underbelly of a marginalized scene took to the streets of Miami and became a mainstay in dance hip-hop and music.

But more than anything else it's a tribute to a time where a group of individuals who in coming of age defined an era. Oye. Ode to. Yesterday. Eulogy.
