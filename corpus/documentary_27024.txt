With hundreds of television channels available 24/7 it's hard to imagine a time when there were only three or four channels all broadcasting for only a few hours each day. Local Springfield television stations began coming on the air in 1953 enabling many viewers to watch television for the first time. This new medium was naturally mesmerizing and unquestionably changed American life in many ways. Ozarks Public Television celebrates this remarkable and innovative era in our newest local history documentary Stay Tuned: The Beginnings of Springfield MO Television.
