Dante has a writer's block and expects a child with Anette while working in her father's meat factory. An idea has come into Dante's mind and he seeks strength by praying to God. He meets Natalja a mysterious femme fatale who becomes his muse and inspiration is flowing again. But now God asks Dante for something else; that he must permit a deathly sin so God can return to earth. Realities collapse and Dante must step down into an Inferno to set things straight again.
