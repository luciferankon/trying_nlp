Harry is the greatest magician there has ever been if you believe the hype. He certainly believes it himself. He's also a man on a mission - to test the claims of mediums across the world. He desperately wants to believe them too...but he knows every trick in the book. He should be good at spotting a fake. After all... He used to be one. Fuelled by guilt and grief Harry launches a moral crusade which tears his friendships apart threatens to destroy his marriage and sees death threats rain down on him from his enemies in this world - and in the world beyond. Little Earthquake lifts the lid on this milk churn of mysteries as the King of Showmen takes to the stage for the biggest reveal of his life. Who will you believe? The Medium? Or the Magician?
