It is dawn on the morning of the vernal equinox. A team of rescue workers has been laboring all night to save people caught in a massive flash flood in the desert. Exhausted and physically drained they slowly pack up their equipment as the dawn light gradually builds and the emotional impact of the night's events deepens. A woman stands on the shore looking off into the flooded valley where her friends and neighbors once lived. She silently waits filled with fear and fading hope for the fate of a loved one her son who will never return.
