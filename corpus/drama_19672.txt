When her husband dies BERNARDA a wealthy and once beautiful woman locks herself and her frustrated daughters away from the world for 5 years of mourning. This is Federico Garcia Lorca's acclaimed play The House of Bernarda Alba and a film crew has descended on the landscape of Andalucia to film it. When the actress playing young Adela mysteriously disappears they have to re-shoot all her scenes and rely on guerrilla film tactics to complete the picture as the money begins to run out. Would-be film maker PEPE a rebellious sensitive village stud owes money to police officer Miguel. The police officer threatens to take Pepe's horse and sell him for dog food if Pepe cannot pay. In order to save his horse Pepe takes on a bet that he can sleep with all the actresses making the film including the older Poncia and Bernarda. Pepe tries to seduce the actresses and discovers that it is not going to be such an easy task. When a tourist disappears and one of the actresses is attacked by a hooded man Pepe becomes the suspect. As the film progresses the action inside the house reflects the lives of its cast; an examination of sexual repression and turmoil with the five daughters under the yoke of the tyrannical figure of Bernarda the matriarch who is haunted by a devastating secret from her past. Shooting Bernarda is a homage to the creative genius of Lorca a struggle between repression and freedom reality and illusion. When her husband dies Bernarda a wealthy and once beautiful woman locks herself and her frustrated daughters away from the world for 5 years of mourning. This is a current interpretation on Federico Garcia Lorca's acclaimed play The House of Bernarda Alba.
