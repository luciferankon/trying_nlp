Here is a 2-minute short film created throughout a day in Los Angeles. With nothing but our cameras we dashed around the city going to as many landmarks as possible. Having lived in Los Angeles for a number of years now we wanted to show everyone that it's not all about traffic and smog. - Los Angeles truly is a beautiful city. In the age of short attention spans we want to share our love for L.A with our generation. Enjoy.
