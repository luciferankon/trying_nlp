Life has a funny way of catching up with us even when we are not looking. Evan (Matt Carroll) and Hannah (Dodi Brown)are two Chicago socialites with the rest of their lives in front of them until an argument forces the couple to re-evaluate their intentions. Fireworks fly during the Fourth of July weekend with Evan's family in Louisiana as the couple come to terms with their uncertain future.
