The Messina brothers are Yesmoke a little tobacco company based in Turin Italy. Originally Yesmoke was an online store for cheap cigarettes selling mainly Philip Morris to millions of customers around the world. When sales reached over one hundred million a year "Big Tobacco" sued them for 550 million dollars obligating them to shut their website down. As a result the two brothers decided to build their own cigarette manufacturing company on the outskirts of Turin taking the fight to Philip Morris in an effort to level the playing field. But today the Italian government and their severe regulations have changed the course of this on-going debate... It's like a gangster movie: there are no good guys just small bad guys fighting big bad guys. Who's going to win this unfair battle? David or Goliath?
