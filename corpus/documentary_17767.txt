For about ten years from 1964 to 1973 Italian production crews made hundreds of Westerns. This documentary looks chronologically at that enterprise starting with the success of Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci: their silent anti-heroes gave Clint Eastwood and Franco Nero stardom. The genre then shifted to political films of the collective downtrodden facing the state. The genre ended spent in comedy and farce.
