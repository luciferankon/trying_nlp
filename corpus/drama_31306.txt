In this story all is out of time as if you look on the clock and see the time 28 hours and 94 minutes or if you're asking somebody about the time and getting an answer: "It's 34 o'clock"... Circumstances are to be near-absurd. All around seems to be wrong but the people are trying to put all in order. Sometimes they are successful sometimes not. But in any case they keep their human being face.
