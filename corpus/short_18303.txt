Morey Amsterdam acts as the guide and joke-teller in this first entry in Columbia's new Animal Cavalcade series (production number 5651.) He visits with noted animal trainers Ira and Buddy Watkins as they put their chimps through their bag of tricks. Then they all go to a local amusement park where the chimps perform some more tricks.
