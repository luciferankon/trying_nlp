As a painter in the court of King Carlos IV Goya - played by the great Lithuanian actor Donatas Banionis (The Red Tent Solaris) - has attained wealth and reputation. He believes in King and Church yet he is also a Spaniard who dearly loves his people. This contradiction presents him with a dilemma. Based on Lion Feuchtwanger's novel Goya is one of ten East German films originally shot in 70mm. This release is the director's cut and shows the influence of great filmmakers from Bu≈Ñuel and Saura to Eisenstein. Goya was nominated for the Golden Prize at the 1971 Moscow International Film Festival.
