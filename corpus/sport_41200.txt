The 1968 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was won by the National League when the legendary 'Willie Mays' (qv) a replacement for the injured 'Pete Rose' (qv) in the N.L. starting lineup scored an unearned run in the bottom of the first inning. The N.L. pitchers then held the A.L. All-Stars scoreless limiting them to three hits over the rest of the game.
