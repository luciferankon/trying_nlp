A group of Dalmatian guest workers from Germany come to their native town on Easter holidays. They usually spend time in a local pub playing cards drinking and yelling. Jure is the most successful and bragging among them while Klempo is considered poorest since he didn't built the house or bought a car. Annoyed by poor cards Klempo places a bet with Jure that he made more money than him. The loser must give everything to winner and then walk around the town naked.
