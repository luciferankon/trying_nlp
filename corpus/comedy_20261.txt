If the Ahmeds have a collective motto at all it is 'Mind Everybody's Business'. From Amma to Abdul everyone is forever getting involved in everyone else's problems work business hassles happiness whatever. But they are not very good at co-ordinating their efforts. As a result they often end up working at cross purposes. Matters are frequently complicated by a motley collection of allied characters - relatives friends envious neighbors old flames new suitors perfect strangers etc. - who compound the family's already dangerous propensity for disaster. As each situation develops the collapse of the Raees Ahmed family seems imminent. Disaster is averted but only in the nick of time and at any rate not before the members of the family have been on an emotional roller coaster ride that leaves them breathless and the television audience in splits.
