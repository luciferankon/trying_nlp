With unprecedented access PASSPORT CONTROL is a riveting on-the-ground look at the journey of a refugee from Iran and the danger of dealing with ruthless human-smugglers in Thailand. Having to flee his homeland (Iran) due to fear of persecution Sia Sholeh looses his fake passport in Hong Kong and is left stranded in a foreign country with no identity. His faith is now in the hands of his brother who is determined to find the right person to save Sia's life. That person is ''Essi'' the most wanted human-smuggler in Thailand who leads one of the biggest organized crime operations in East-Asia. 45 minutes south of Bangkok exists the city of lust and outlaws Pattaya where we search for ''Essi''. This small city is home to some of the most notorious drug dealers and human smugglers that have ever lived. The urgent mission to find ''Essi'' in Thailand takes the audience on an unprecedented journey and gives them an inside-look into the world of passport forgery and human-smuggling. Filmmaker Reza Sholeh embeds himself in the heart of darkness and risks his life to find this prolific counterfeiter in order to save his brother. PASSPORT CONTROL is a chilling visceral depiction on the breakdown of unlawfulness and the blurry line between good and evil.
