Based on the hit play. A British Government Minister puts forward a bill to battle filth in the UK but that doesn't stop him having an affair with both his secretary Miss Parkyn and Wendy the wife of a high-up reporter. Opponents to the bill - mainly some hippy girls lead by Johnny kidnap the Minister's best friend and co-founder of the bill Barry Ovis just as he was getting married to his fiancee Joan. Barry escapes just before the police raid the hippies hiding place - to claim that Ovis was in a orgy and get the bill defeated - and dashes back to his and Joan's flat followed by Inspector Ruff who is investigating the kidnap and Damina one of the hippies. Meanwhile the Minister is also trying to use the flat to carry on his affairs with both Wendy and Miss Parkyn. The Minister Barry & Joan tries to keep the truth from Ruft Wilfred Potts an old and honest MP Birdie the Minister's wife and stop the hippies and this causes no end of trouble. A cabinet minister is strong on attacking the permissive society in public but pretty good at philandering in private. A planned private assignation at his London flat with his personal assistant gets out of hand as increasing numbers of other people arrive unbeknown to each other.
