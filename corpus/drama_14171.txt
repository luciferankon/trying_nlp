A paroled convict's efforts to improve conditions at a boys' reform school alarm the school's corrupt warden who has been embezzling funds from the institution. He hatches a plan to derail the reformed convict's efforts and have him sent back to prison and part of that scheme involves cracking down hard on the reform school's inmates.
