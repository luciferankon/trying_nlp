The Seth Peterson Cottage is a Usonian design structure in south-central Wisconsin designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. After being in a state of disrepair for decades this 880 square foot building was renovated and celebrated the ten-year anniversary of its resurrection in 2003. At the time of its rehabilitation the Seth Peterson Cottage was the only Wright-designed building in the world that the general public can rent and occupy. The cottage was commissioned by Seth Peterson an architecture enthusiast and one of the earliest computer programmers in the state of Wisconsin. The drawings were completed in 1959 and sadly neither Mr. Peterson nor Mr. Wright lived to see the completion of the cottage. This cottage was the dream of Seth Peterson a man who loved architecture who dreamed of having his own Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece. After Peterson's death and after the cottage had changed hands it fell into a state of horrible disrepair - and was considered to be a total loss. If not for the work of a very small group of true believers the cottage would have disappeared entirely. But years of dedication and fund-raising saved the cottage. Much like the proverbial Phoenix it rose from the ashes. And now it is truly a "Jewel in the Woods."
