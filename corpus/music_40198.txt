Live at the Palladium is a live concert DVD by the punk band Bad Religion released in March 2006. It features footage from two nights at the Palladium in Hollywood California on November 21 and 22 2004. The DVD uses seamless branching to offer two viewing options: The full concert interspersed with interview footage of the band. Only the concert footage. The only Bad Religion albums that do not have songs represented in this performance (of those which were released prior to the date of the filming) are Into the Unknown No Substance and The New America. The version of Cease is played on a solo piano as recorded on Greg Graffin's solo album American Lesion. After the band has finished playing "21st Century (Digital Boy)" Greg Graffin incorrectly identifies the song as the "Against the Grain version" when in fact they played the Stranger than Fiction version. The title card before playing "Along the Way" shows that the song is from the album How Could Hell Be Any Worse? (possibly referring to the 2004 remastered version which includes their early discography minus Into the Unknown) when in fact the song was never recorded for an album release; it actually appears on their 1985 EP Back to the Known.
