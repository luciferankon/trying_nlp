Does it still make sense to reflect on love? A singular form of intellectual shame exists on this issue while however countless and continuous are the questions that constantly cross the human feelings. Has every relationship a temporary destiny? Why do I desire to be loved just/precisely from that woman? Who can I trust? Saying I will love you forever  am I expressing something true? What is Indecent? With pure heart makes intellectuals and poets dialogue with old and new generations of lovers trying to open the gates of a possibile heart's wisdom in order to reach a finishing line/goal able to reassigne dignity to the love message and avoid its reduction to an deceitful and irrational phenomenon.
