Barcelona Year Zero is a documentary-series that shows the city throw the eyes of people that have been living in the city for a short while. In each chapter people from different origins and social classes explain us how they experience the city. Top-executives street sellers hotel directors taxi drivers children in school age and even a seminarian talk about the same places of Barcelona showing their contrasting views. A funny mix sometimes dramatic but always surprising.
