In 2015 filmmaker Amin Hassan embarked on a two-month bicycle trip through Eastern Europe accompanied by one of his friends. This trip becomes the basis for his vivid travel journal: stories about people their conflicts and dreams endless landscapes and changing destinations. Ultimately the filmmaker takes a summarizing look at his home country Austria and the way it handles the refugee crisis. The result is a no-budget documentary that takes the viewer on a journey with its romantic at times obscure truthful and yet subjective images.
