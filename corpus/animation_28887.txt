One starry night the baby Jesus is brought into the world and a bright light signals that the new savior is born. As everyone rejoices King Herod becomes jealous and threatens the Christ child. But a courageous and unlikely pair - an ox and donkey living in the stable where Jesus is born - spring into action to foil his evil plan. As the ox recruits other barnyard animals to help slow down the king's soldiers the donkey guides the baby Jesus Joseph and Mary to safety. This delightful animated tale is the perfect Christmas gift for the whole family.
