A rich old gourmet that has decided to taste all there is of exotic meals has already tried the most even human flesh when he gets a tip from a rich midget. The midget had tasted everything out of this world and even something not of this world. In other words a ghost. The gourmet gets very interested and the midget gives him the info that is needed. And once he has found a haunted place all he has to do is wait for the ghost to turn up so he can have the most exotic meal in his career as a feinschmecker.
