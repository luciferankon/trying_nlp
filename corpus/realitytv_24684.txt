For a short summer season each year the New York Hamptons become a retreat for world famous celebrities and the super rich while Manhattan's young elite flock there to network pose date and party! Beautiful women who are shamelessly on the look-out for a rich husband and wealthy male singles on the look-out for available women and a good time - everybody has an agenda and it isn't about lying in the shade with a good book. It's about standing out from the crowd and making an impression with all the right people. This is a glossy and aspirational series about much more than just sex and partying. It is about smart and attractive youngsters fighting Gender Wars in one of the most beautiful and desirable settings in the world.
