Unique in the genre of exploration and adventure films ICE PEOPLE takes you on one of the earth's most seductive journeys-Antarctica. Emmy-winning documentary filmmaker Anne Aghion spent four months "on the ice" with modern-day polar explorers to find out what drives dedicated researchers to leave the world behind in pursuit of science and to capture the true experience of living and working in this extreme environment. And as it turns out the film also witnesses one of the most significant discoveries about climate change in recent Antarctic science. Intense public focus on climate change has turned the shores of Antarctica into a new tourist mecca making the earth's coldest continent the hot place to be. But inland from the penguins and ice floes is a magical Antarctica of volcanoes boulder-strewn valleys and ominous glaciers. Only a small number of scientific research teams get there braving severe conditions to learn about our planet's history and make predictions about our future. ICE PEOPLE heads out into the "deep field" with noted geologists Allan Ashworth and Adam Lewis and two undergrad scientists-in-the-making where they scour across hundreds of miles to find tiny critical signs of ancient life. Their findings would give the first evidence of a green Antarctica over 14 million years ago that disappeared with a sudden shift in the temperature of the continent. The most authentic film about life on the ice since the trailblazing expeditions to Antarctica chronicled nearly a century ago ICE PEOPLE conveys the vast beauty the claustrophobia the excitement and the stillness of an experience set to nature's rhythm.
