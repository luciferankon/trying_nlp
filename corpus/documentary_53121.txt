Unlike other educational documentaries RE:Thinking offers a new hope for public education by looking at three schools that create a culture of intellectual life that respects the whole child as a learner and adult-in-training. The future of our society depends on the creativity and competence of the young people who are currently making their way through our public education system. Bringing thinking skills into the classroom doesn't require new technologies or tests but rather an awareness of how we construct meaning from information. We see three different schools where teachers and students alike understand more about how they think and as a result are able to think in more accurate creative and systematic ways. RE:Thinking shows the powerful positive change that occurs when teachers and students are empowered to build knowledge instead of memorize information. Following the work of cognitive scientists Drs. Derek and Laura Cabrera RE:Thinking takes a systems thinking approach both to exploring the very purpose of education and in imagining what is needed to prepare young people for an uncertain world.
