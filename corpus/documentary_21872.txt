An engaging film as the title suggests depicting the complex relations between parties involved in a labor dispute. A self-organized non-union group of workers struggles to regain infringed rights in the wake of a factory closure. A soft-spoken woman is pushed to the front as its leader while big shots in business suits from political parties and bureaucracy come and go all claiming to be sincerely concerned with the workers' plight.
