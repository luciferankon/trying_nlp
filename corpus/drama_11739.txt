While playing cards Col. Francis Fielding is unjustly accused of cheating by the Earl of St. Albans. The charges are considered so serious in that strata of society that Fielding is disowned by his parents and held in contempt by "proper" society. Fleeing to Paris Fielding marries and fathers a baby daughter he names Leonore. His wife soon dies and he is forced to raise the girl on his own alone and broke. He soon dies and Leonore is adopted by his sister Lady Mountstephen but it's not much of an improvement: the "lady" hates Leonore treats her badly and finally disowns her. Things look grim for Leonore until Lord Fitzmaurice loans her a sum of money. Unfortunately that deed arouses the anger of the wildly jealous Lady Norton who is secretly married to him. Complications ensue.
