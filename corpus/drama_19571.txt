She invites a doctor friend for dinner and casually turns the discussion to the topic of suicide. the doctor suggests some methods including a gun shot which he find has some kind of 'dignity' to it. So the old lady breaks out a gun from her familial belongings but the ancient weapon no longer works. She tries getting it fixed at an antiques shop but things take a pleasant turn when she finds herself getting friendly with the proprietor. however just as the suicidal thoughts are receding from her head events take a turn once again.
