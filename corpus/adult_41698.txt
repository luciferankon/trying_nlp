A bartender is given a job by his friend who owns a pub. His first day on the job is complicated by his scuzzy friend who shows up at the bar thinking that it's going to be easy to get laid because his friend is the bartender and a trashy blonde who wants to party at the bar but has no money so she offers to pay for her bar tab by other means.
