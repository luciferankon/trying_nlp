The goal of this documentary is to inform people about the harsh and very real realities of fat shaming and fat hatred - to expose how fat hatred permeates our popular culture spreading the message that fat is bad and in turn forwarding the idea that being cruel unkind or downright unjust to a fat person is acceptable behavior. And then to inspire change.
