Abitibi is a region of Québec known for its forestry and mining resources that is situated 500 km north-west of Montreal. Its name of Algonquin origin signifies Ť Where the water is shared ť water from the river flowing into Bay James and the water that makes the St-Lawrence river grow. For many milleniums the Algonquin people were the sole owners of this land and to them knowing the rivers' course was a question of survival. When the first Europeans arrived about 400 years ago they were trappers at first and until the end of this past century they were loggers. In 1920 the first mining cities were built. The aboriginals principally Algonquins were essential guides for these newcomers in all their activities then without any consideration for their heritage they were obligated to move for the imperatives of economic exploitation. 160 000 people live in this region today 6000 of them being Native Americans.
