In this whimsical rather fey movie in a setting that's both shabby (the city) and grand (the landscape) two couples who trade places and two older men who bother the shy main character Fleischman wander in and out of scenes in a hotel perched on a mountain and topped by a pointed weather tower. There are dreamy breathtaking panoramic views of sky clouds and the city of Liberic below. Up in that tower Fleischman practices the art of meteorology and shies away from girls.
