A day in the life of a family in the countryside near Belgrade during the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999. Ognjen maybe 16 horses around with his younger brother Milan who's about eight; they leave together Ognjen to visit a friend and Milan to walk through the woods to buy beer for his parents. Accidents happen: one is in hospital on a respirator his parents taking the bus to be by his side; the other comes upon an Allied pilot an American hanging from his chute in a tree. Armed partisans are in the woods looking for the pilot. Bombs fall: there's collateral damage.
