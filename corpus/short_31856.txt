The Dynamists is a short artist film that involves twelve disruptive teenage boys and the Belgian poet and musician Angelo Perrotti. Alluding to the Coming of Age movie genre with its 'rites of passage' the video attempts to capture the transitional instability of adolescence and proposes disruption and conflict as an essential part to growth.
