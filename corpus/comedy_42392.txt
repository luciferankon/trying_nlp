SELF-HELP is about a self-conscious man-child's inner dialogue brought to life. Danny Abrahms plays the patient and therapist of his character's mind dealing with issues like career dating sex and more as he makes the transition to independence and adulthood. SELF-HELP shines a light on the conflicting relationship we sometimes have with ourselves and allows us to laugh about it along the way.
