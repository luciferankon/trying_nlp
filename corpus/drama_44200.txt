Two successful women fed up with the LA dating scene take home two broke but handsome construction workers for a one-night stand after they mistake them for gigolos. When the boys discover the misunderstanding they storm off in humiliation but are quickly lured back when the girls offer to put them up in their pool house -- for sexual purposes only. Though the experiment goes well at first all four quickly find themselves fighting their emotions as sexual relationships give way to emotional attachments forcing them to discover new sides of themselves and confront their inhibitions about falling in love.
