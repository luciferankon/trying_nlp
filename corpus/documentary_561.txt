Gijon's "Labor University" is the maximum example of monumental architecture during the Franco autarchy in Spain (1939-1959). A boarding school for a thousand children this "socio-educational laboratory" enacted the aspired future shape of the country. Using audio fragments of films from the two first decades of dictatorship this film essays complementary ways to reveal the implications of this building-city its ambiguous position between utopia and dystopia and its unique architecture straddling the inventions of Piero della Francesca and Piranesi.
