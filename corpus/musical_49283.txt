Two con-men "play the palace" in this breezy adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's well-known satirical tale. Mr. Stitch and Mr. Sew wreak havoc at Wits Ends Palace when they present the Emperor with a special gift; an exquisitely beautiful "magic" suit of clothes invisible to all but the wisest of men. A charming exploration of the dangers of vanity with a host of hilarious characters that includes a brassy tap-dancing bugle-playing Empress.
