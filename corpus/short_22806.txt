Alt Space is a culture project in just and sustainable living by Lead Artist Reg Flowers following his purchase of a stone house built in 1897. The project brings together neighbors grassroots organizations and allies in the social justice community providing an incubator space to develop sustainable independent community-controlled resources. The project promotes re-imagining how these resources can be shared to achieve fair access to power and the ways power is produced and reproduced.
