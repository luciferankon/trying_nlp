Professor Green sets out to discover the modern face of homelessness changing our perceptions of who the homeless are and the harsh reality of their lives. From the shocking streets of Manchester where rough sleeping has doubled in the last year to meeting those trapped in the same cycle of temporary hostel life and sofa surfing he uncovers a generation of people without access to normal society or to their futures.
