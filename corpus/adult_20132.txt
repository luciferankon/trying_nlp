Timothy and Jason are brothers. They are experts in the arts of bondage and discipline. They are compelled by a strange and twisted desire to molest and sexually abuse voluptuous girls. This abnormal compulsion relating to their fanatical religious ideas causes them to bind (tie up) their own sister. It's one of the most talked-about scenes in the film: "The Scene of a Dozen Clothespins!" Driven wild and mad by a micro-mini-skirted secretary Timothy and Jason kidnap her. In a secluded area of the woods they alternate and repeatedly assault her. They conclude their torture with an incredible "Double Golden Shower Scene." At the end of the film Timothy and Jason meet their deserved fate but not before they abduct a young mother hold her captive and perform "unnatural" acts. The almost unbelievable "Milking Scene" is the climax of the movie. Masters of Discipline is not a documentary however it documents many varieties of abnormal sexual behavior. Psychiatrists have dealt with the personality dysfunction of such affected individuals and in many cases say this is a result of arrested psychosexual development. The purpose in for this film is to enlighten and educate adults who may be interested in understanding bondage and discipline.
