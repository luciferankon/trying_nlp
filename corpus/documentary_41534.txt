In October 2008 Standard Railcar RM31 'Tokomaru' journeyed through the Wairarapa from its home in Pahiatua enroute to Feilding. It was about to take part in the centenary celebrations of the opening of the North Island Main Trunk Railway during the forthcoming Labour Weekend. The journey really started many years before when in 1973 RM31 was purchased by Wellington railway enthusiast John Murphy with the eventual aim to have it running on the main railway lines of New Zealand once again. Unfortunately less than nine months before RM31's trip to Feilding John died suddenly and so was unable to see his dream fulfilled. When RM31 lined up as part of a cavalcade at the Centenary Celebrations John's aspiration of having his railcar back running on the main line became 'A Living Dream'.
