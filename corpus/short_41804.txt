In a not too distant future there has been a world-wide dictatorship that automatically defines "The System". The power grip of this structure has been so well orchestrated and implemented that the same population does not appear to experience the bond of slavery for which it has been reduced.

Our story takes hold of the moment when the rebel leader chooses to deliver himself spontaneously in the opponent's arms knowing to go to the first "Public Rieducation" or a brainwash in the public square.
