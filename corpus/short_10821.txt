Mr. L.J. Haley of Illinois a successful farmer for over 35 years tells us why he purchased a McCormick-Deering tractor to replace horses on his diversified operation. He was impressed that International Harvester is the world's largest maker of farm tractors with nearly one million customers. And he knows that IH tractor design has been standardized and models do not greatly change from year to year so old equipment will still work with new tractors. But he learned years ago that buying a good machine is not enough--the machine is only as good as the service behind it. Mr. Haley especially appreciates that every McCormick-Deering dealership maintains a complete service department: up-to-date clean filled with specialized equipment and spare parts and staffed by well-trained mechanics who can do any repair from minor part replacements to overhauls.
