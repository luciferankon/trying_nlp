The blessing of the horses is the highlight of the still very popular annual Gerard Procession at the Saint Gerard Majella Church in Weebosch. The Miracle of Weebosch follows three teenage equestrians in the lead-up to the procession. Their expectations insecurities and love of horses are rendered with tenderness. The Catholic celebration lives on in the village but it's not easy for everyone to uphold the tradition in these modern times.
