SEAS OF LOVE is an ambitious 90-minute documentary taking a long hard look at the plight of our oceans and how The Coral Restoration Foundation is making an amazing difference in this world. The film takes an in-depth look at how environmental stressors are threatening the world's coral species... and how one scientist has started a grass roots movement to save the world's dying reefs with a revolutionary restoration program with new techniques starting to be implemented around the world. The documentary focuses on the scientific breakthroughs leading-to precious new offshore coral nurseries and implementing restoration programs for threatened coral species. The innovative techniques of these programs are allowing tens of thousands of new coral to be grown and transplanted strategically in reef areas through the help of scientists volunteers students public aquariums and the general public. The result is the recent historic success of the first nursery-raised corals to spawn in the wild.
