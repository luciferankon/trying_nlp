A crime scene is filled with mysteries but nothing holds more secrets than a dead body. And when it comes to solving these mysteries there is no one better than "Murph." Michael "Murph" Murphy is considered an 'artist of autopsy.' He's a dynamic relentless former Chief of Police and detective-turned-coroner in Clark County (Vegas) where he oversees both the medical and investigative teams. They handle more than 3500 souls a year (2000 of which are mysterious deaths) and in Vegas that means they see cases that no one else in the rest of the country will see.
