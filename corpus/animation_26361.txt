William Tell is summoned into town to plead on the behalf of his jailed son Christian. On his way he falls into an ice cave and in his unconscious state is given 3 arrows by an ice warrior; one for truth one deceit and one to gain nothing. When Tell refuses to bow to the evil Governor's hat the irate Governor declines to release his son unless Tell shoots an apple from Christian's head. Tell aims and fires a perfect shot and insults the Governor for which he himself is jailed along with his son. The governor attempts to transfer Tell to a special dungeon and on the way Tell escapes killing the Governor with the deceit arrow. As Tell rushes to free his son he comes across the coach carrying the fleeing Lady Margaret evil Mistress of the Governor's court. Realizing that this last arrow would gain him nothing he spares her life and instead gives her the arrow. She departs in peace.
