Ariyoung's unrelenting hate for her father throughout her childhood and adolescence drives her to meticulously plan her vengeance. Knowing that Jin-sub's new wife Shim Soo-jung is a popular actress Ariyoung works her way up the ranks until she earns enough cachet in the TV industry.

To complete her revenge and cause the maximum amount of pain Ariyoung also plots to steal the fiance of her half-sister Eun Ye-young the gentle-natured Lee Joo-wang. Helping Ariyoung in her plans is Jo Soo-ah her mother's friend whose ulterior motive is that she wants Ariyoung to marry her son Ma Ma-joon.
