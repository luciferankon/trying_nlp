The Coop is a story that tells that everything is not always what it is seems that what you see is just what you want to see. Taking off from human behaviours as natural consequences of all interactions in the universe this story tells that the human actions are never completely voluntary that there exists a factor which shapes this action and that the most elemental factor is the 'sense of I'.
