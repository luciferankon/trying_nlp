There is a war raging around us - in society in our churches and in our homes. It is not a battle over marriage race or the sexual revolution. Rather it is a battle for the truth. Is God real? Does He speak and if so how would we know? While many churches are faithfully proclaiming the truths found in Scripture others have lost confidence in the Bible's divine authorship. The God Who Speaks is a 90-minute documentary that traces the evidence of the Bible's authority through interviews with some of the most respected apologists scholars and pastors in the evangelical world. This film answers common objections about the Bible's reliability and equips believers to confidently base their lives on the power of God's Word.
