Jorge types in notes and treatment for a "script/story" that he is developing. While typing semi-drunk we hear him narrating bits and pieces of stories and memories of his old friends Tami Marie Mike Teresa and deaf Steve. All the friends were homeless in South Florida at times sleeping under bridges at times hanging out in Jorge's apartment. Through Jorge's unstructured narration the film depicts portraits of daily life of each of his friends. The movie begins with a short prologue based on interactions that we the crew had with some real men not actors that we met in the streets of Florida during production.
