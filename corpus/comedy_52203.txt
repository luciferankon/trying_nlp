SITUATION/COMEDY Electric LadyLand is a half-hour situation comedy bustling with tons of fun-filled modern family antics. The only difference - It is a look at an ex-rock guitar player with his own sweet set-up - The living breathing world of a guitar sales and repair storefront - Electric LadyLand. With a nonstop revolving door this shop is a magnet to wild rockers fun seeking models and unusual music scene chaos - but it all change when he finds out he is the father of a now independent bright wide-eyed colorful spirited wonderful thirteen-year-old kid - dillion. Who is more of an adult than his dad and guardian riff who is no way happy with the phrase "full custody..." It all starts with a RIFF - (noun):; usually associated with repeated phrases in jazz typically supporting a solo improvisation; but in this case Riff's the owner of Electric LadyLand - and the lucky victim of life's debacles.
