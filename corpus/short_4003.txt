Memory Strains is a video from the viewpoint of the elevators of Eiffel Tower. The elevators are the vessels that have carried people up and down the tower's living body for over a century and the operators are their guardians. The elevator operators have heard snatches of millions of lives in numerous languages for over a hundred years. "Memory Strains" pays homage to these lives with sounds and images that flicker by creating a vertical flow of motion.
