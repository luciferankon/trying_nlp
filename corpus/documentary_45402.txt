Agnack is a place where both rivers and people converge in the most stunning of ways - a place where it is considered perfectly normal to speak a minimum of six languages. For the first time in history the people of Agnack- the Baďnounk people- allowed cameras to film as they prepare for an unforgettable event and capture the mystery surrounding their rituals. The Baďnounk culture is more threatened now than at any point in its long history due to abrupt changes brought by colonisation conflict globalisation and migration.
