In August 2007 TV presenter and comic Patrick Kielty took to the stage of Belfast's Grand Opera House not as a stand-up comedian but as a rookie actor in a new production of Marie Jones' controversial play A Night in November. Based on the now notorious events surrounding the World Cup qualifying match between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland at Windsor Park in 1993 the tragi-comic one man play drew packed houses as it moved from Belfast to London and then on to Dublin. With full access to Patrick Kielty someone with his own bitter experience of the troubles this compelling behind-the-scenes documentary reveals whether those audiences were ready for such a provocative depiction of the darkest days in Northern Ireland.
