A cutting-edge science program exploring Artificial Intelligence with one of the world's greatest minds -Professor Rodney Brooks as he races to create the world's first affordable personal robot. "In just twenty years the boundary between fantasy and reality will be rent asunder. Just five years from now that fantasy will be breached in ways that are as unimaginable to most people today as daily use of the World Wide Web ten years ago." Come on a nail-biting journey as robot scientist Rodney Brooks attempts to build a robot as sophisticated as a human being. For nearly a hundred years science fiction has heralded a brave new world of robots. For scientists the reality of that dream is much harder to achieve - but there are pioneers who relish the enormous challenge of integrating mind and machine. Australian-born Rodney Brooks is one such pioneer. With a vision that is truly revolutionary Brooks wants to do to robots what billionaire Bill Gates did to the computer - to make them so affordable and personal that they will become commonplace both at home and in the workplace.
