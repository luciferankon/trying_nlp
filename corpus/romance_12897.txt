Sai Kung Story is a series of three vignettes set in Sai Kung. In the first a village girl dreaming of going away to the city as a model clashes with a fashion designer who has dropped by her village for inspiration. In the second a young slacker postman who sends letters to a girl from her boyfriend in France falls for her. In the last a widow must consider whether to accept the love of her dead husband's best friend as she toils away in her in-law's eatery house.
