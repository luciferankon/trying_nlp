Three-part documentary following two families on their way from the horrors of war in Kosovo to the primitive conditions in a refugee camp in Makedonia to their new life in Randers Denmark. Here they wait patiently stuck in limbo not knowing when it is safe to return to their own country. And not knowing what is left of their houses back home.
