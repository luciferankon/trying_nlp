In his work from the early '70s until today Endre Tót questions not only the communistic system of the East but also capitalism in the West. He takes an ironical stance against every form of prescribed happiness. In this the artist's point of view is autobiographically informed. Tót whose works are to be found in the most important collections of the world is a witness of his time. At the centre of the film is Art Informel in Hungary navigating border restrictions through mail art the internationality of conceptual art and Fluxus and the philosophy of ab- sence.
