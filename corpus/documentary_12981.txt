Built in 1905 as a hostel for working men Arlington House in Camden Town London has been home to generations of emigrant Irish. Many of these men came to Britain to seek a better life but lost themselves along the way. MEN OF ARLINGTON tells their stories and represents a forgotten chapter in the history of Britain and Ireland. Threaded through these testimonies is the work of the Aisling Return to Ireland Project and the history of Arlington House said to have been home to more Irish men than any other building in the world.
