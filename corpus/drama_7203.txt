Journalist Silvia travels to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo to shoot a documentary film. Immediately she is confronted with the reality on the spot. Only very few people seem to believe in the forthcoming first democratic elections. UN forces are helping rebel groups to inspire their confidence. And there are still renegade mercenary groups roaming the country-side indoctrinating children for war. Silvia has to realize that the people are acting like figures in an absurd game which rules she is unable to understand. The film tells a story of threatening everyday life in Congo and the possibilities of the individual to live/survive when playing his role.
