Car collectors from around the world are flocking to a small town in the heart of the Midwest for the chance of a lifetime. In a closed down family car dealership in Nebraska the mother lode of classic cars--many having less than 10 miles on the odometer--are going up on the auction block. In this special presentation HISTORY will have exclusive access to the collection and the auction. The special will be hosted by Brian Unger and feature Top Gear's Rutledge Wood and Tanner Foust.
