Tired of the life of a gunfighter Lish Henley settles down in the quiet California town of Peaceful Hill. The town however doesn't live up to its name and it's not long before Lish finds himself the unofficial "mediator" of the town which is being terrorized by various outlaw gangs. Lish has his own style of "mediating" however--he keeps killing members of rival gangs until they agree to holster their guns and leave the town alone. However one day Big Bill an old enemy of Lish's shows up in town with his gang looking for payback.
