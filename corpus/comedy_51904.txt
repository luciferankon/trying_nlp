Brother James "The Weasel" Cavanaugh is getting remarried and asks brother Francis to hold the wedding ceremony in his home with his priestly grandson officiating. Francis ("Pop") decides that's okay especially since his rival will probably be occupied with marriage and they won't fight nearly as much. Can there be a glitch? Yes. When Evelyn the bride arrives she is heavily veiled and doesn't make a sound -- but Pop still recognizes her in a quite literal "Scent of a Woman" sense as a woman he himself dated in the past. (She wears a distinctive brand of perfume he instantly recognizes). Evelyn storms out of the parlor and locks herself in the bathroom cuing a beaut of a brotherly quarrel.
