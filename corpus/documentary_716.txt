There is currently a spiritual awakening happening worldwide. After being suppressed and told what is normal by religious institutions for long periods of history people today can speak their mind and practice alternative beliefs as they wish. They are not fearful of any repercussions or any stigma attached. They are Spiritualists and Spiritualism is here to stay. Memoirs of a Medium looks at the current spiritual revolution from the perspective of the people involved. We tell the true life story of Sean Conway as he comes to understand that he is a spiritual medium. Sean was just like any child growing up in the seventies coming from a large family in a small house in Sligo. He spent his days exploring the countryside with his identical twin brother Liam. All seemed well by day however by night Sean was being visited by strange visitors people from the distant past. Petrified by fear Sean told others of his experiences but they fell on deaf ears. With nowhere to turn not even his twin brother he began to feel isolated and decided to not speak of it. Only when he meets Asha his spiritual mother does he discover his true calling spiritual medium-ship. With change however came resistance from both his inner self and also the people around him. We explore how after first being frightened of ridicule he now uses his gift to help others. Reflecting the complexity of medium-ship and spirituality as a religion academic experts and grassroots activists explain this shift in beliefs and tell us what they are exactly. They tell of the benefits certain people gain from medium-ship. Shot on location in Ireland Memoirs of a Medium reveals this new spiritual revolution.
