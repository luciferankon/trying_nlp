A journalist Adoum (Youssouf Djaoro) having obtained his passport wants to travel abroad so to be able to report on the situation in his country; but while at the airport a compromising letter is found on him. Adoum is thrown in one of Koulbou's jails. All hope seems lost but Adoum finds unexpected help from Koulbou's estranged wife Hawa.
