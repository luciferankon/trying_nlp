Many ancient cultures teach that sacred knowledge continuously emerges from the universe in the form of the Primordial Teachings. These universal truths come into being spontaneously and exist perpetually and eternally because they cannot be destroyed. As time and consciousness passes from one world to the next these sacred truths of eternal wisdom reveal themselves granting mortal man the opportunity to learn the true nature of The Creator's intentions regarding the universal forces that control everything around us the higher mind and the hidden workings of the process of enlightenment. Part Two of this series is focused on expanding human consciousness. We cover the following advanced studies: How do the primordial teachings reach our planet? What is primordial radiation?
