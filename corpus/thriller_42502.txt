Johanna Morgan is a serious young journalist who successfully profiled a "Charlie Manson" type serial killer and his cult for her magazine - to great accolades. After being found guilty on all counts she decides to write a novel loosely based on this hypnotic murderer and his devoted followers. As she reconnects with the women from his cult she finds herself alienating from friends family and all that's familiar to her as she falls under his lethal pull. She retreats to a cabin in the woods to complete her novel which takes more of a hold on her than she has on it - and in exploring this dark side of humanity she begins a slow descent into madness. It's "The Shining" meets "Aquarius".
