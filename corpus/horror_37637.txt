It's Christmas time in Cleveland Ohio and four young ladies are on the verge of completing their mandatory thirty days of community service. With only one night to go they are required to make a series of in-home visits to the older and less fortunate. Upon arriving at their final stop for the night they become introduced to a pleasant older woman who graciously welcomes them into her home for the evening. However as darkness falls and the cold settles in they begin to realize that there is far more to their seemingly innocent host than meets the eye.
