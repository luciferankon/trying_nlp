This film is a three part project presenting the Heidelberg Project in Detroit though the experiences of the artist/founder Tyree Guyton. Early influences personal traumas artistic works social commentary meld together to define 'art as medicine'. This film is particularly timely as Tyree will leave his creative enterprise of 30 years in the hands of the community as he moves on as an independent artist.
