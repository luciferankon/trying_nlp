For 365 days the director and writer Alice Schmid accompanied the mountain children of the municipality of Romoos with her camera in the craggy wild landscape around Mount Napf to the mythical chasm of Aenziloch where according to legend thunder is created and demons are dwelling to the present day. She created powerful images of the annual cycle in the Wild West of Lucerne.
