In the 1960s young women fainted during the shows of Quebec crooner Michel Louvain who has been a heartthrob for 52 years. "Ladies in Blue" takes an affectionate look at the everyday lives of five women of different ages and walks of life who idolize the singer. While reflecting on Louvain's enduring career and celebrity the film examines the universal lure of the unattainable that lies deep within each of us.
