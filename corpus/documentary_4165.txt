I DANCE MYSELF is a feature documentary that explores the life of legendary dancer and choreographer Bob Curtis. His father was born a slave in rural Mississippi and Bob grew up doing the back-breaking work of picking cotton in the segregated South. At a time when black dancers were not accepted he received a scholarship from one of the world's leading ballet institutions--The School of American Ballet under George Balanchine. He was also the first black dancer in the legendary José Limón company and studied with the mother of Modern Dance Martha Graham.
