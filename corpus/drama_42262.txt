Assaf Dayan stars in this award-winning dramatic study of an Israeli family in crisis. It is Sunday morning. Like most Israeli soldiers on weekend leave Lieutenant Ziv Gonan is returning to his Israeli army base. His father drops him off at the Beit Lid bus stop and as he waits there a bomb explodes killing 18 people and wounding 62 others. Ziv's family hears of the bombing and waits in an agony of suspense to hear what happened to him. Based on a personal story of Ayelet Bargur.
