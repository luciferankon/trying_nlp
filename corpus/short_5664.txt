A video collage of song and remembrance. Drawn from Judith Magyar Isaacson's highly acclaimed memoir the film recounts her real-life story as a young Hungarian girl growing up during the tumultuous years of WWII and the Holocaust. Following Judith's present day journey back to the places of her past Seed of Sarah also reflects her interior journey to recover memories she had long repressed as a means of survival. The film's soundtrack is a riveting contemporary electronic opera for one voice composed by Mark Polishook and featuring acclaimed vocalist Angelina Reaux. Staged scenes from the opera together with rare archive footage and private family photos combine to create a haunting tale of a young woman's coming of age.
