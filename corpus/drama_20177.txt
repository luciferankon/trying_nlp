The Future Ahead charts the enduring friendship between Romina and Flor from first love to first divorce. The film is written in three blocks without flashbacks: Romina and Flor confronting pubescence; at just over 20 when one is a mother; at 30-something with as the film turns part circle children as old as they were when the film began.
