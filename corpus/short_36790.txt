Synapse takes its name from the synapses in the brain that transfer electric activity (information) from one cell to another. My video Synapse acknowledges the inseparable organic connection between energy and information. It also relates brain activity to the spread of information between people. Synapse portrays a couple's memories and feelings as digitally fragmented electrical activity sporadically disrupted by static.
