This film is dedicated to you and me and all those who leave their roots in search of a place that they hope will better serve their needs whatever they may be..career personal or professional growth family needs or simply a better lifestyle. The film sheds light on the struggles hopes and fears joy and sorrows disappointments frustrations loneliness sacrifices and the whole spectrum of emotions that one goes through in the process of amalgamating and blending with one's new home.
