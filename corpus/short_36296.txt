Days Like This is a dark experimental character piece that follows a day in the life of a misanthropic sociopath who makes his living killing people. Hardened and jaded by a rough life encompassing horrors that are left to the imagination but reflect in his bitterness towards others and life in general. All he has to live for now is his routine. The film is narrated by a soliloquy representing his thoughts on what he and the outside world has become and how his work no longer factors in a question of morality but is just a job to him as any job would be to anyone else.
