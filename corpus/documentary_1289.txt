Formula one has Ferarri with its huge success and legion of fans. Australian motor sport has HRT. The link between a high performance car manufacturer in HSV and its racing division has produced the most successful racing partnership in Australian motor sport history. The Holden Racing Team won six championships in a decade of V8 only or V8 Supercar racing in Australia and was almost unbeatable in the late 1990's. For five consecutive years HRT won the Australian Touring Car Championship. Several great victories at Mt Panorama in the Bathurst 1000 put the icing on the cake for the team. The list of the team's drivers read like an Australian motorsport who's who with the likes of Peter Brock Mark Skaife Jim Richards Craig Lowndes Greg Murphy Larry Perkins Win Percy Allan Grice Tomas Mezera Neil Crompton Wayne Gardner Brad Jones and Jason Bright all driving for the team.
