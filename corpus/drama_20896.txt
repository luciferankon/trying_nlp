Caryn knew as soon as she saw the guy that he was a cop so when Lumpy got busted by this snitch friend of his who Caryn never liked she knew she had to get out of the house until they could get back on their feet. Staying on the couch at Ray's isn't bad but it's gotten old with Katie who doesn't like Caryn around her house or her kids anymore. Maybe she can get a night out of their place before she heads over to Loretta's for a bit. She knows she can stay as long as she wants to but nobody really wants to stay at Loretta's any longer than they need to. As it turns out Caryn finds somebody to give her a hand with Willie and pass some time playing cards. She's with Jack for a little while but sooner rather than later she's got to figure out what to do about Lumpy and how or where Jack fits. When things start spiraling out of control Caryn sees it's time to take a hard look at where she is and decide on a new direction.
