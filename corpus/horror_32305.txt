Deep within the underbelly of Paris there is a club which is the home of a secret wicked society. At first it resembles an ordinary fetish or Goth nightclub but within the cavernous building are many hidden rooms one of which is known as "The Room of Souls" a private gathering place of the world's richest and most evil people. Their host is the elegant yet frightening Madame Sabatier. For their amusement each member takes a turn and spins a true tale of depravity: A good wife learns that her husband goes out at night to abduct and murder young women; a botched suicide attempt leads to a drug-induced dream; a girl is believed to be possessed by a demon and her overly religious parents enlist the help of a corrupt reverend who has his own sinister plans. We are invited inside the deranged mind of a respected surgeon as he takes us on a guided tour of life death and everything in between; a young street prostitute crosses paths with a charismatic flesh trader and is forced to take an unspeakable journey of sex violence and murder; a nun is abducted off the streets of Rome and held captive for over a year turning her into a feral murderous creature to be unleashed on society; a chance encounter on a fateful bus ride for an unsuspecting girl who dreams of riches and fame is her undoing; a man picks up a woman in a nightclub and soon finds himself at the mercy of a cult of women who believe consumption of their sacrifice will bring them to their highest form of female dominance; an unflinching look into darkest Africa where human life is traded for fortune and the most unspeakable atrocities are committed.
