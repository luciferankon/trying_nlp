This is an indepth look at life and leadership on an aircraft carrier as it travels some 8000 miles from the US coastline. In it we are introduced to several men of varying ranks and backgrounds who are followed throughout the documentary. In the end as they dock back on the shores of the US we are treated to a very personal scene of the families reuniting.
