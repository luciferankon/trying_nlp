Considered one of the best films produced during the 1960s and often referred to as Hong Kong's version of "Gone With the Wind" this two-part epic film follows the story of three women who all love one man. The love of tough but radiant "Sun" (Julie Yeh Feng) the pure and gentle "Moon" (Grace Chang) and the fragile and self-sacrificing "Star" (Lucilla You Min) for the idealistic university student Xu (Chang Yang) lead them all to the battlefields of World War II. This wonderfully romantic 1961 film directed by Evan Yang withstands the test of time.
