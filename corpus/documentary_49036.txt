Chinese New Year is the most important day in the Lunar Calendar. Over a quarter of the world's population celebrates the Spring Festival. China is the world's economic powerhouse - a melting pot of construction sites designer stores young and eager workers working for the new wealth that reflect the face of this new China juxtaposed against the iconic images of this ancient city - home of culture and learning hutongs and all the scenes of tradition. We see packed trains and buses hundreds of conveyor belts of consumer goods and crowded department stalls. We see scenes of festivity and celebrations dragon dances and fireworks. We hear from the men and women of the city - the importance of tradition and family at this time the importance of identity in a country where growth is overwhelming and all changing. We will reveal how a family of 4 generations comes together to mark the beginning of a new year. We see the culture the reunions and sumptuous meals the traditions lost and those that are being revived and what it takes behind the scenes to make it all possible in a 21st Century China.
