Antediluva is the story of a young couple from two backgrounds that are worlds apart. Jessica Slater is no stranger to cold evenings without heating and having to work hard for the little she has. William De Lacy recently graduated from Oxford and plans to write a book about the life of his grandfather Harold 6th Earl of Pontefract. Childhood fantasies about Prince Charming aside Jessica never once thought she would fall in love with such a powerful heir as William let alone be preparing to marry him. William loves her so he doesn't care. The problem is can Jessica ever be accepted by the De Lacy family who have slightly more grand ideals for whom their protégé should wed.
