A Bernini plaster cast traverses various physical and virtual filmic states. The film stages the production process of vacuum forming a plaster copy from the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa (1647- 1652) by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The scene is set in an anonymous metal workshop where the operations of the vacuum former and actions of the technician are observed in a highly surveyed arena through multiple disembodied perspectives. Denying any formal conclusion the film is a form of reverse engineering that takes the object back into a screen and the bodily movements of the performer are analyzed using an artificial motion tracking.
