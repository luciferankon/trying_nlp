Jerry Bines is trying to live down a past that includes killing a man (in self-defence) theft and an alcoholic abusive father. He sees hope for redemption by providing life-giving bone marrow to his leukemia-stricken son. But time is running out because an escaped killer (Gary Percy Rils) is coming to town to exact revenge for ancient sins. And like the old buck in a backwoods tale he spins for his kid Bines must stop running and turn to face his hunter.
