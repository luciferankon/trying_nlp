Selwyn Froggitt a well read clumsy buffoon smashes his way through his sleepy Yorkshire village of Scarsdale in these 30 minute 1970's comedies. Starring Bill Maynard in the title role he creates this loveable Oaf perfectly cushioned by a terrific supporting cast of character actors. Referring to The Times supplement for his knowledgeable information with shovel in hand his schemes and plans create a fitting end to every episode. Disaster !
