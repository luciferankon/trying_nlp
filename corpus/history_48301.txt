Rome: 80 AD. You are standing in the Arena of the extravagantly decorated Colosseum surrounded by 50000 cheering Spectators. You witness a bitter fight between two Gladiators directly in front of you. This is a fight to the death: you are in the middle of it. Later you find yourself in the Emperor's Loge observing the triumphant and the fallen far beneath you. The populous bellows they have already decided. Now it is up to Emperor Titus to pass judgement on the defeated.
