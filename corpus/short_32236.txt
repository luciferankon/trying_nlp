A foraging tribe peacefully lives in the middle of the Baa Land. A young girl named Quira (Sam Booc) is the firstborn child of the only pure bloodline of the Baa Tribe. Her father Chief Euba (Leon Miguel) and his wife Thema (JP Liboon) have been praying to give Quira a little brother before their tribal bloodline goes extinct. The feared chief of a rival nomadic tribe Chief Taca (Mon Confiado) has been in love with Thema for a long time and now learns that she's carrying a new baby inside her. He then mercilessly slaughters the Baa Tribe to make them feel his envious wrath. But faith finds a way to survive as Quira escapes the slaughter only to return years later to avenge her tribe and her parents' merciless deaths. However her quest to revenge the memory of her tribe defies her peaceful upbringing.
