On this voyage a classmate persuades Daniel Duck into believing that doing good deeds will earn him "heaven points". When Captain Jay shares the good news of the gospel with him Daniel resists at first convinced he must work his way to heaven. Meanwhile Alby buys an expensive old sea chest on eBay. Thinking it must be full of pirate's treasure she spends the voyage trying to get it open through hilariously explosive means. In fact the longer it takes to open the greater the imagined riches inside it become! Of course she is reminded in the end where we ought to store our treasure when she finally gets the thing open and looks inside. After running himself ragged in the good deeds department Daniel eventually realizes that the gospel is a free gift and prays to receive Christ. In fact he goes on to share the Good News with others!
