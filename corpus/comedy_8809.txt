Mrs. Emma Foster of Fosterboro Ohio loves to enter contests - which she never wins - the time she spends on which is much to the chagrin of her exasperated husband barber Otis Foster. It is ironic then that the one contest for which she becomes a finalist is the Happy Noodle company's Mrs. America contest to determine the nation's best homemaker as she never has time or the want to do any housework that burden left to Otis. The two are required to attend the contest's national finals in Atlantic City with all the other finalists and their husbands. There Emma has to find ways of getting Otis to do the homemaker type tasks required of the finalists those tasks which she has no aptitude to complete on her own. Otis also finds that he is in a legion of other exasperated husbands who would rather be anywhere else than at the contest finals supporting their respective wives. And Emma finds that she is not alone in doing whatever it takes to win the contest. Thrown into the mix is Steve Walton Happy Noodle's regional representative for Emma's area he who has fallen in love with the Foster's pretty daughter Louise.
