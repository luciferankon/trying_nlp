Prior to the release of their EP "It's About Time" Missing Pages performed one of their most inspired live sets April 30 2005 at Mr. Small's Funhouse in Pittsburgh PA. Now for the first time you can see Missing Pages perform their catalog of work in the most complete DVD package ever offered by a Pittsburgh band. As an added bonus the DVD features behind the scenes footage and the music video Weekend in LA filmed at Kennywood Park.
