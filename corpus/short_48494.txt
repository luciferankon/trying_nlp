Poet Hedwig Gorski plays a storyteller who rides down the Vermilion River in a Cajun wooden boat while telling of a teenager girl in Nova Scotia who is coming of age in her father's fishing village shack. The poem is set to original blues music. He leaves his shack at dawn to fish the bay while she goes down the road to meet a "forbidden boy" she likes after practicing her kiss in the mirror. When the storytelling ends the camera pans to the boat captain and fiddler who are in 18th century garb. The fiddles plays a Cajun melody.
