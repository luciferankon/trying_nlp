Jack Richards a professor in his 50's has apparently gone mad over the supposed abduction of his daughter by a sinister cult. Wallowing in self-pity for years he decides to commit suicide. However the manner in which he decides to suicide is quite peculiar: he allows himself to be abducted by a cult whose members treat him as their "king" for one year (he is given a castle concubines gifts etc...) and then murder him as an atonement for their yearly sins.
