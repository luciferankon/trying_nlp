India is synonymous to wisdom but all of it is in its glorious past not the present. A visit to the 'Moksha-Points of the World' in Bihar which has Nalanda (ruins of the World's greatest International University of Spirituality) Bodh-Gaya (the place where Gautam Buddha received his enlightenment under the Boodhi tree) Pawapuri (the place where Lord Mahavir the founder of the non-violent Jains gave his last sermon and left his mortal body) Rajgir (that place of the Mahabharat times where God's Avatar Krishna came to release all the kings of the world being imprisoned by Emperor Jarasandh and gave them enlightenment to lead a life dedicated to humanity as a ruler) and the ancient 'soul-enlightenment' places of Indian traditional-culture: Gaya where there is a foot-mark of the restorer of world the Almighty God Vishnu: the place where souls after leaving their mortal bodies gets entry to the abodes of peace by their blood-relatives (pind-daan).
