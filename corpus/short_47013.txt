It's Seymour's birthday...or is it? And who's that little girl? Maybe faith maybe hope but definitely not justice as Seymour Baruch can find no justice in life. Day after day Baruch raises a cocked gun to his head playing a game of Russian roulette with the devil's advocate. Yet day after day Baruch is rejected from hell heaven or whatever God has to offer.
