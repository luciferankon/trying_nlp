This film tells the story of those who built and those who now struggle to maintain the giant Russian war monument known as "The Motherland Calls" which was constructed in Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) to commemorate the victory of the Soviet Union in the crucial battle which took place there between 23rd August 1942 and 2nd February 1943. This huge structure which depicts a standing woman whose right hand extends upward and holds a raised sword and whose left hand is extended in a calling gesture was designed by sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich and structural engineer Nikolai Nikitin. At the time of its dedication in 1967 it was tallest sculpture in the world. It measures 87 metres (279 feet) from the top of the plinth to the tip of the sword. The woman's figure is 52 metres (170 feet) and the sword is 33 metres (108 feet).
