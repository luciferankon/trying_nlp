The soundtrack to a radio soap opera set in a luxury hotel is acted out by characters who are riding a ramshackle bus from Bangkok to a small town in Thailand's Northeast. When the bus stops the drama in the characters' real lives can be seen. In different cirumstances it's not hard to imagine the characters - a young small-town girl (glamorous model) an older woman (hi-so boutique owner) an illegal Burmese immigrant (hotel waitress) half-Thai backpacker (handsome hotel owner) soldier (ladyboy hostess) and dodgy businessman (dodgy businessman) - assuming the lives of their larger-than-life soap opera alter egos.
