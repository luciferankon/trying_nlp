Garry Anson is anxious to run his horse "Rangemore" in the ascot Stakes but his trainer knows he can't beat another entrant "Silver Queen" so it would be more opportune to hold back Rangemore for another race. Garry writes to his girlfriend Wenda not to bet on his horse His bookmaker Dory objects strongly to this and urges him to send another note as fast as possible to explain the first was a joke. Garry does though it's written on the back of a banknote. Rangemore loses and Wenda is furious sending the first note to the Jockey Club. things look dire for Garry until the bank note note can be recovered.
