Pasupathy (Shiva) the nomad is in search of a job desperately so that he can clear his loans and also get his sister married off like a "one shot two mango" thing. So he gets a job not without unleashing a volley of lies to the MD (Prakashraj). Post winning the heart of the company's MD Shiva's dice of life rolls out as a stack of lies that keep piling up. He tricks the MD by claiming he has a twin brother who is a menacing Karate master but full of rotten values. One lie just leads him to another and that just doesn't stop there as he has no other option to retain his Samaritan character. The striking difference between Pasupathy and his brother Kandan is cat eyes and riding on that he shuttles between Karate Classes and his work not to leave out the maid-turned-mother (Kovai Sarala). Shiva's good boy image just keeps peaking and so does his lies and as always truth is very bitter and has to come out one day. The rest is all history unveiling itself.
