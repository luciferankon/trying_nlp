Four lads decide to meet up and do a robbery planned by Sweeny an angry agressive but small young man who is like a time bomb waiting to go off. The robbery never happens because the boys soon realise Sweeny hasn't put enough thought into the job. His closest friend Tel has a more gentle side to him and falls for a girl at a party called Kak. Gombo is released from a young offenders and along with Tony finds Sweeny to give him a kicking which actually ends up with Sweeny giving Gombo a kicking! In the end they find an empty house where the owners are away on holiday so they decide to break in. This doesn't quite go to plan either.
