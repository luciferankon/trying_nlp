On the 26th of September of 2014 43 poor young men students from a rural teacher's college in the small town of Ayotzinapa were kidnapped in the town of Iguala apparently because their activities might disrupt the speech of the wife of the mayor of Iguala. Reports say the mayor told the police chief to make them disappear. In the course of this human erasure three bystanders were killed along with two of the students. Another student was found with his face torn off obliterated a warning: he was no one you are no one too; we control everything; you control nothing including your own fate. The bodies of the rest have not been found though at one point some possible murderers said they were murdered the night they were kidnapped then incinerated. Mexico went into a black state everywhere students and all the youth were placing their profile picture in Facebook pitch black in mourning in despair in frustration of not being seen or heard. The artist Ana Teresa Fernandez is painting herself black with a broad brush the kind you'd paint walls with not canvases: she's blotting herself out an obliteration to protest an obliteration. Her work is against erasure annihilation is for asserting the existence of the power of the voice of the rights of those who are trampled erased obliterated women immigrants the poor the brown the black the dark. It's an art of confrontation as well as liberation. And maybe the two are inseparable.
