Raíces Aéreas is beautifully filmed and narrated. It is both an aesthetic and educational film that provides a much needed space and forum for the discussion and presentation of the rich theatrical production of Cuban dramatists in exile in the United States and in Europe. It is an essential tool for understanding and teaching the complexities of Cuban exile through the lens of theatre and performance.
