Against Filial Piety ponders one of the oldest Chinese beliefs; the gravest offense of filial piety is not to have offspring to carry on the family name and blood. The film also relates to feelings of failure in not being able to fulfill the filial responsibility. This five minute single framed 16mm experimental film includes the word "barren" from 34 different written languages which were extracted from dictionaries. The individual word or symbol disintegrates as it being enlarged to resemble landscapes or graphic shapes. The colorful technical drawing s of human anatomy and the cycle of childbirth are combined and contrasted against the monotone enlargement of Xerox copies of the word "barren" which breaks up and converges through out the progression of film.
