Phoebe Lester a little country girl whispers to her pet hen "You've laid an egg for a man from New York. Ain't you proud?" and while taking breakfast to Philip the new boarder who came from that distant place she gazes at him as if he has come from an unknown land. Returning to the city with a newfound love and regained health Philip struggles to sell his poems to bring his "egg" girl to her New York. In the meantime Phoebe's brown hen proves to be a golden one and her egg money buys a ticket to Philip and her Wonderland. On the train Laura a flashily-dressed woman meets Phoebe and tempting her with a nice new dress takes her to her house. There Owen a former employer of Philip is fascinated by her simplicity. Such grandeur and strange "fizzy" drinks overwhelm her but Providence intervenes when the little brown hen hops into the street with Phoebe scrambling after. A big-hearted policeman finds her and takes her to Philip and acts as "bridesmaid" at their wedding. Their little home built on much love and little food is brightened by the adoption of Johnny an abandoned baby that Philip finds on the dumbwaiter. Johnny brings good luck and Philip secures a good job through Owen and in nicer quarters their cup of happiness seems to be full when Owen to further his ends contrives to get Philip to gamble with borrowed money. Phoebe convinced by trickery that Philip is unfaithful is heart-broken and believes that love and her New York are unreal after all. But the yielding grief-stricken country girl awakens Owen's better self and with his help the unhappy household is reunited.
