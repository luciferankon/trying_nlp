The great Udo presents himself and a little bit more at "Kampnagel" in bis hometown at the so called "Waterkant". The concert is taken from a live gig from 03.Juni 2011. A lot of good 'Ã–l friends made music with Udo and his so called " Panik Orchester" at that day. These are: Jennifer Rostock Max Herre Clueso Stefan Raab Jan Delay and a few more. Enjoy!
