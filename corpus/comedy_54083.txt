For Marion and Vincent active fifty year olds on the whole things are looking good: they survived the education received from their parents and have overcome the education of their two children Victoire aged 26 a mother of two young children and Cyprien a student aged 20. A new life - they think - is beginning for them: it is nice to take a break and to think of oneself at last. The birth of Zo√© Cyprien's daughter is going to disturb the new stability that Marion and Vincent thought they had found all the more so because Victoire who now has new professional responsibilities is calling on Marion more than her fair share to look after her two young children. And this is how Marion finds herself confronted with daily problems - looking after the grandchildren shopping meals visits to the doctor games and other activities - which take her back thirty years to the time when as a young mother somehow or other she reconciled work and family life with the active help it is true of Vincent who did not grumble about sharing the things to be done.
