Zivojin Pavlovic is one of the most significant Serbian film directors and poets. He is also one of the coauthors of the film Grad (City) - the only film with court injunction in SFRJ. During his life he made 16 films and most of them were hidden for some period of time (Povratak /Return/ Zaseda /Ambush/ Crveno klasje /Red ears/ Let mrtve ptice /Flight of dead bird/ Dovidjenja u sledecem ratu /Goodbye and see you in the next war/..) As ideologically unfit he lost his job as the professor of Faculty of Dramatic Arts and became clerk. In this film Pavlovic talks about his conflicts with censorship and about similarities and differences between censorships in countries which made the former SFRJ.
