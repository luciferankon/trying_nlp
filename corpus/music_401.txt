From his earliest recordings with Roxy Music at the beginning of the 1970s Bryan Ferry has taken his place as one of the most iconic and innovative musicians and songwriters to emerge in popular music. Ferry's "Olympia" tour travelled the world in 2011 including this spectacular performance filmed on July 25 at the ancient Roman amphitheatre in Lyon France as part of the Nuits de Fourviere Festival. The show features tracks from across Ferry's 40 year career including classic Roxy Music songs solo hits and his renowned interpretations of other writer's material all delivered with the style and panache that is uniquely Bryan Ferry.
