For 100 consecutive days actress Melanie Cruz filmed an improv monologue as a different character each day and followed five rules: 1/ one continuous take; 2/ once record was hit--that was it--no stopping; 3/ she was only allowed to use what I had on hand--no purchasing of additional props or costumes; 4/ she was only allowed to prepare in the hour preceding filming--it was to be true dramatic improv; and 5/ provided she was at home she filmed in the same location every time.
