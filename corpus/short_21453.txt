Where do we fit in the world? Are we part of nature or separate? If we are not part of nature how do we explain the connection we feel with animals? If we are part of nature why do we sometimes bring discord? At the Beartooth Nature Center in Red Lodge Montana the impact of humans is abundant. The main characters consist of wild and not so wild animals... and Don - the Animal Care Manager who has "adopted" the animals into his family. Most of the animals are at the center due to human influence and none will ever return to the wild. However it is the influence of another human Don who brings comfort and love into their lives.
