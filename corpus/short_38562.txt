After a night's filming Françoise the director is sleeping soundly. But not Anna her main actress and life companion. She does not feel tired and is in the process of watching the segment of "Germany in Autumn" made by Fassbinder. At a time she decides to awake Françoise so that she watches the film with her. But she 'd rather go on sleeping. Which irritates Anna who would like her girlfriend to be more politically committed and produce works commenting on the state of today's world like Fassbinder did.
