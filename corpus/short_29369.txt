In a coffee shop a young couple is finishing eating when the conversation takes a serious turn. She challenges him to have more hope more optimism less cynicism and to do something out of the ordinary just for the heck of it. He says he is who he is. She realizes she's in love with someone she may not want to build a life around. So she issues an ultimatum to make a wish on a fallen penny. Will he accept the challenge? And what if he does?
