Can one escape from family to get into a mental hospital? An overdose of drugs - and you are "free". Now Dasha lies on a hospital bed paints and smokes. She smokes. And smokes. And smokes. Sometimes she is visited by two women: a young one speaks about the death and about Nietzsche an elderly one pronounces monologues about the fashion about the food about the schizophrenia. They come and go but nothing changes. A closed space of the mental hospital is more and more hard to endure. How much is she going to stay in this box?.. A day of discharge comes. She is going to return back home.
