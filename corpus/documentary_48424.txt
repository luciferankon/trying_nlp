Santa Cruz de la Salceda is taken as an example for many villages in Spain. In 1936 nine inhabitants were murdered by supporters of dictator Franco. Some of these victims were exhumed and laid to rest in 2003/2004. Portrayed are witnesses from both sides... and family members and exhumation volunteers. The residents of Santa Cruz who are still not reconciled torn between hard right wing sympathizers and more leftist thinkers still in fear. "Fear is what we grew up on"... In Spain were the depicting of the Franco era still did not find entrance to national education in schools - when will the descendants of the brutally murdered and hastily buried pawns come to terms with their history in this picturesque landscape they live in which soil is stained with blood.
