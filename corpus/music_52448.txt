It is rare when four of the Bolshoi's greatest stars appear together in their home theatre in one of Russian opera's masterpieces. The opera was Tchaikovsky's The Queen Of Spades (Pique Dame). With a libretto written by the composer's brother Modest this tale of terror with a plot involving obsessive love and gambling hallucinations and descent into madness never fails to have a profound effect on its audience. The Bolshoi's production is riveting with sumptuous sets and costumes and the famed Bolshoi chorus and corps de ballet are at their most elegant and spectacular.
