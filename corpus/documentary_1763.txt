Wassim Beydoun in Cooperation with H.H Sheikh Sultan Bin Khalifa Al Nahyan Humanitarian & Scientific Foundation created this documentary about Thalassemia that document the stories of 7 people living with Thalassemia around the United Arab Emirates. The documentary tells the story of these 7 people and what they go through living with Thalassemia. They show us how their lives aren't that different from others. Thalassemia is a form of inherited autosomal recessive blood disorders that originated in the Mediterranean region. In thalassemia the disease is caused by the weakening and destruction of red blood cells. Thalassemia is caused by variant or missing genes that affect how the body makes hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. People with thalassemia make less hemoglobin and fewer circulating red blood cells than normal which results in mild or severe anemia. Thalassemia will be present as microcytic anemia which may be differentiated from iron deficiency anemia using the mentzer index calculation.
