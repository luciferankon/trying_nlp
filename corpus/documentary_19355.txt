There are plenty of obsessions in the world but few endeavors attract as much devotion as wine. American Wine Story is a documentary about oenological aficionados who have taken their obsessions to the extreme chasing their dreams with a bottle in one hand and a corkscrew in the other. This is an amazing story/documentry about wine makers and how they came to be in the industry. There is a main sub plot that deals with people pulling together to help get a harvest of grapes in after the main charachter wine maker suddenly dies leaving a huge hole in all their collective hearts as it was that knew him. This is a phenominon that is rarely seen today. A whole community of wine growers coming together to heal each others deeply felt love for the fallen wine maker without exception. How people of all walks of life end up choosing to build a wine business from scratch. From the land purchase type of grape and the grape growing to the crushing at harvest. Also shown is the friendlyness between the grape growers/owners and the hard work to survive in a very competitive industry.
