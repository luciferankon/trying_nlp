As Adolf Hitler tightened his control over Europe in early 1939 Jews living inside Nazi Germany and Austria were increasingly desperate to escape. But restrictive immigration policies in effect in the United States made it all but impossible for more than a handful to find freedom here. Gilbert and Eleanor Kraus a Jewish couple from Philadelphia were determined to do what they could to help bring a group of children into the safety of America. Against all odds the couple came up with a rescue plan aimed at bringing 50 Jewish children out of Vienna and into the safety of the United States. This documentary film tells a dramatic story that has never been told before -- how one courageous couple saved the lives of 50 children on the eve of the Holocaust.
