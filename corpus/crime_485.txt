Businessman S.K. Dharampal lives a wealthy lifestyle in India along with his socialite wife Shobha a college-going son Vijay and a well-endowed house-maid named Chhamiya. He does not approve of his wife spending too much time away from home usually at gyms and Mahila Mandal meetings. To make matters worse he is asked to meet with Dr. A.K. Jayant a Psychiatrist who had apprehended Vijay peeping on women who were being intimate with their spouses. The doctor asks Mr. Dharampal and Shobha to keep a close eye on the sexually aroused Vijay and ensure that he does not do this again. Dr. Jayant is also concerned about Vijay as he finds his pretty daughter Neetu has fallen in love with him. Then Mr. Dharampal gets a visit from the Police - who claim that Vijay is on the run after killing a woman named Nisha Sahay who is the wife of Avinash and a close friend of Shobha. The question remains did Vijay really kill Nisha and if so what was his motive?
