In the Serbian drama "White White World" the characters sing but never dance. Formulated as a modern day Greek tragedy set in the decrepit eastern mining town of Bor the movie follows a close group of alienated locals through misguided love affairs and other brash misdeeds. But the songs feature no choreography or other stylish methods of breaking the harsh downtrodden tableaux.
