The history of falconry among the Naxi people of Lijiang in Yunnan Province can be traced back more than 700 years. Experienced falconers and apprentices treat their falcons and hounds as members of the family. Together they run through the fields of Yunnan full of energy and life. Each day of hunting is a battle of wits between a man and his hawk. This isn't simply a historical tradition to the Naxi. It is a vital liberating enterprise. Falconry may be under threat from wildlife conservationists and the growth of tourism in the ancient city but for the falconers today is another day to go out hunting with their beloved partners.
