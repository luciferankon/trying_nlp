When the latest group of young adults come to NashvilleTN after a year in Costa Rica they are thrilled at the big city life just miles away from their old plantation home. While living in the old home some mid-dream encounters occur. After a few nights of this the girls talk over breakfast and realize that it may not be dreams at all as the same young girl and dark figure appear at both bedsides. As they begin to ask questions to small town locals they learn the dark history of the home and the effects it had on the previous mission workers that passed though the same cycle. Lily is not as tormented by the story and as the houses attempts to control her the story reveals why she is the one to watch.
