Come with us as we travel the dark back roads of Arkansas in search of haunted locations where only the brave of heart go. Watch a woman struggle as spirits surround her; hold your breath as a black Hell Hound stalks a man and his wife; see a ghostly girl lure a man into her home and listen as a couple sit in their darkened home shocked by an argument between two ghosts. Join us as we talk to the men and women that search for evidence of hauntings and help us to understand why they do what they do these Arkansas ghost hunters these seekers of truth.
