Typical of the Trem Carr-produced Monogram westerns starring Rex Bell this one opens in the East with Craig Larrigan as a polo-playing playboy who has no use for the West nor the western way of life. Rancher Jess Bailey accompanied by his daughter Virginia comes east to get his eastern-business partner John Larrigan to advance him more money to keep their rustler-plagued ranch afloat and Craig and Virginia strike up a romance which is going nowhere fast because of his elitist attitude. The contrived motivation to get the Bell character out west makes less sense than usual and the incidents that follow carry no logic either. Craig Larrigan's father and his partner own a large cattle ranch that is losing stock to rustlers. Craig an easterner heads west but in the disguise of a Mexican bandit. He is eventually throw in jail with his identity still unknown. His cell mate is one of the rustlers and when they breakout the rustler takes him to the gang and Craig now has a chance to capture them all.
