Awake / Asleep is a short intimate experimental film that was made using night vision camera. The actor Maarten Claeyssens (27) is being filmed in an intimate way by a woman during a whole night in a period in his life in which big changes occur. The viewer doesn't know what the relation between the two of them is. She keeps waking him up asking questions. Does night bring more lucidity? What is real and what is fiction?
