Two small-time comedians playing in seaside town have run into trouble. Indeed after stealing a motor-scooter the police are after them. Taking refuge in a beach hut they take off their theatrical costumes and don instead the uniforms of two sergeants who are bathing in the sea. Bad luck makes them encounter a warrant officer on patrol. The latter mistakes them for real sergeants and takes them to the nearest barracks. A whole lot of tribulations ensue but the two associates finally contribute - unwittingly of course - to the capture of a gang of forgers.
