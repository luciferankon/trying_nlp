In France during World War I an army payroll car containing $250000 turns up missing. A GI nicknamed "Spuds" because of his prowess at peeling potatoes discovers that it was stolen by German spies and--since his captain was responsible for the car and will be in big trouble if it's not recovered--goes behind the enemy lines to retrieve both the car and the $250000 payroll.
