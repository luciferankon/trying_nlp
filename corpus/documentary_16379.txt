Documentary about the Maasai People in west central Kenya whose ancient cattle breeding culture is facing it's doom. The Danish NGO Mellemfolkeligt Samvirke has a few developing projects among the Maasai. But how does one help them to fit their best interests? Should one encourage the Massai to integrate (against their will) with the rest of society? Or should they be supported financially to be able to reestablish their cattle breeding and continue to live outside the modern world? Mellemfolkeligt Samvirke had to choose between these two incompatible strategies.
