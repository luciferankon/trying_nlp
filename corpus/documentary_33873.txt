Both Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette are invited by Joon-ho Bong the director for the film "Snowpiercer" to Korea and other locations as well as given small character roles in the French comic book's film adaptation. They had learned that the comic book had become a major hit in Korea and that Joon-ho Bong wanted to create a film of it. The comic book "Transperceneige" had been pirated and published as a Korean version two years before they had attained knowledge of it.
