A screenwriter and a director are working on a film about Sara a Palestinian girl in one of Gaza's refugee camps who is a victim of an "honour killing". The screenwriter is unable to write an ending that is both compelling and fictitious - the happy ending that he had hoped for. Meanwhile the director who is insistent on upholding the truth is as keen to end his film as he is to help his friend who is deeply affected by Sara's story. The film presents the different sides of Gaza whose people are hurt by everyday issues as much as by death.
