The storyline has been re-tooled to offer an experimental and contemporary revision of the 1968 original - much like a DJ remix. Slated to generate royalties for the Night of the Living Dead "survivor's" who are responsible for the creation of the 1968 film. Benefit for the Living Dead (aka the Survivor's Cut) is largely misunderstood by Romero fans. This release was designed to utilize the services of benevolent organizations to help administer royalties to the 'surviving' parties who elect to receive dividends.
