The Great Polar Bear Kingdom is in Decline. The Great Ice Barrier is melting. When Prince Bigsby a young Polar Bear cub crosses the Great Ice Barrier he is swept away on a sheet of ice and lost at sea. Or is he. The ice melts and Prince Bigsby washes up on the shores of Australia. Bigsby quickly makes friends with many Australian animals. His new friends promise him they will help Bigsby find his way home. What Bigsby learns is that his new friends have a situation of their own. It will take all them to fend of the Extictables. The Ostracrates and his Extictables time travel to current day Australia to restore Australia to its previous pristine beauty of fifty thousand years ago. The Ostracrates will stop at nothing to eliminate all animals and humans from Australia with the Annihilation Wave. A creation of his own unequaled intellect. Can Prince Bigsby help save Australia with his new friends and find his way home? Or will Ostracrates and the Extictables make current day Australia their new home.
