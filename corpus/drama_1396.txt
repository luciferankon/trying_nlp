A beautiful house with fruit and nut trees and a vegetable garden. The summer is about to begin and the sound of the cricket chirp chirp fills the air. Graciela an architect who retired after her partner passed away has lost her cat. Holanda an actress who is getting ready for an upcoming opening finds herself growing old alone and increasingly tired of drama. Gabriel the gardener who is also Graciela's lover does not seem to be much more than a mere bystander. A terminal illness comes to define the ties between them. The cricket sings and nobody listens.
