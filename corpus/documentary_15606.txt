Take a Bow is a documentary about developmentally disabled kids staging a musical at a private school in Illinois. This immersion-film chronicles four kids varying in disabilities as they work towards opening night. Interspersed with play preparations interviews with parents faculty and students spotlight the surprising lack of resources available for disabled Americans. Given the challenges awaiting them following graduation this play is one of the only moments in which these special children can really shine.
