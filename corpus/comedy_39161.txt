Snafu is the story of a girl Florence who is constantly rediscovering her purpose in life. Florence is all about throwing herself into the deep end or going "balls to the wall" as the kids say to pursue the thing she was put on Planet Earth to do even if she just discovered it like... this morning. With her strange but loyal roommate Eli by her side there's no telling what Florence will do to pursue her dreams or how many messes she will make along the way.
