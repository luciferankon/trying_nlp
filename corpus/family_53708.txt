Workaholic German investment bank executive Jan Holzer has a shot at a long-wanted promotion if he can swing a Swiss hotel group's building project on Cuba. It hangs on buying coastal lands owned by the uncooperative nostalgic family Ortega. Holzer travels to negotiate there assisted by locally married German ex-pat Walter Marquez. He also falls in love with a stewardess who turns out to be an Ortega.
