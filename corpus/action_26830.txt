Rachel Crow stars as a woman who is approached by a man who has kidnapped her daughter. If the woman complies with the man's wishes then the daughter will be set free. If not the wishes will be carried out on the daughter. Be warned that this is a creepy movie. it was made as an "opposite of Hollywood" movie" about a sexual predator. Mainstream movies about these villains actually make them look cool and if a rape scene is shot well (according to the sensibilities of cinematography) then it look sexy. Notorious director BILL ZEBUB decided to make a movie in which the villain plays with his victim but in a way to make you feel sick watching it rather than to make a good horror scene or a kinky sequence so all of the rules are thrown out in this ultra disturbing experiment. Watch at your own risk. A bonus clip of the actress talking about the movie is a MUST-see after watching her character's ordeal just so you know that the actress was perfectly safe and that she was in control the whole time (in real life).
