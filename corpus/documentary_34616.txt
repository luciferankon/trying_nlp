Electric energy was one of the pillars of progress within the context of peace sustained during the Porfirio DÃ­az era. The electric industry was first backed by national private enterprise but over the years foreign investment made it flourish. Following the 1910 Revolution the Federal Government launched a plan to achieve nationalization. Thus the Federal Commission of Electricity (CFE in Spanish) was born. 74 years after it was founded it is still the only company in charge of providing Mexicans with electric energy and with creating infrastructure for its generation and transmission as well as the modernization of the industry and the exploration of environmentally friendly energy sources.
