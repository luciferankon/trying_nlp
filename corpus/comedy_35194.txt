Berlin widower Paul Kr√ºger a retired ex-GDR stone mason (66) hates foreigner immigrants especially Muslims. When his beloved doting granddaughter Annie plans to marry Deniz an ambitious student and waiter in Ankara who needs a visa for Germany backward Paul and his buddy publican Karin go on Turkish 'holiday' so he can talk her out of it. But Deniz proves her only choice and probably a right one even if countrymen and family win Paul's heart as well as a resourceful preteen-thief who proves an orphaned Syrian refugee. Paul even promises to plead with his counterpart Deniz's family patriarch who opposes him marrying a Christian infidel at pain of expulsion from the close clan.
