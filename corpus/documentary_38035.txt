Sex Crimes Unit is an unprecedented look inside the New York District Attorney's unit dedicated to the prosecution of rape and sexual assault. The film examines the history of injustice toward rape survivors; trails the unit through its investigations; tracks the case of a prostitute who dared cry rape; and follows one survivor's 16-year journey to justice.
