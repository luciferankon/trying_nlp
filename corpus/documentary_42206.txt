In 2006 I meet for the first time my biological father.He is dowser. I become him. The movie mixes my apprenticeship of dowsing with the link that it weaves between the two of us. Beyond this it questions the spectator about his relationship with the universe. Return to basics is an initiatory and identical diary. (Bernard Blancan)
