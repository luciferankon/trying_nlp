This is a coming of age film with an ending that will bring tears to the bravest of hearts. Ten-year-old Brett Bonham cannot bear to look at himself in the mirror. When he does he sees his twin brother who was tragically killed in a New York car crash. Neither can his mother Carla look at him without seeing her lost son.
