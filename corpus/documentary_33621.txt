The portrayal of a quite unusual schoolmistress and her pupils through their last year of primary school. She teaches intellectually gifted and mentally retarded or disabled kids with different cultural backgrounds together in the same classroom. While the school administrator is struggling to find a teacher willing to instruct the disabled child in the upcoming high school year we watch the mistress and the children working on subjects like: "what is God to me?" "what happens when we die?" "am I normal?" The teachers intention is to make the kids involve in the understanding of each others individuality and culture. "Normal" is an example of the traditional school systems values turned upside down. The children basically don't have to fit a norm. The norm in this classroom is to learn to understand diversity and difference as a chance and richness.
