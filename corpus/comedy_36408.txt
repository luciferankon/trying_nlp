A Robot with Artificial Intelligence is used to advise attractive single women in how to find and keep the man of their dreams. It is set up as a slightly rude and very funny sketch show with each episode (9 in total) filmed with a different model. The pervy Robot has a keeper who tries to ensure everything runs smoothly during the consultation sessions. Unfortunately it's not long before the pervy Robot suggests ideas that are too sexual for the model to cope with and she will blow a whistle which calls the keeper back into to the room to restore order.
