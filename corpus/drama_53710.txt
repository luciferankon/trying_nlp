Manor of Redemption is a run down 18th Century restorative clinic where wealthy eccentrics are exorcised of the evil of creative expression. An innocent young artist joins the last few inmates (an egotistical dandy a has-been actress and a schizophrenic widow) and against a background of peculiar therapies they reveal scraps of their interwoven histories through a series of metaphorical monologues on identity ego and self image whilst events and revelations are observed and guided by a mysterious masked figure in the attic.
