In Los Angeles there is the Golden Triangle Freeway Interchange. The 5 405 and 10 all crossover each other. As long as the traffic can move through the Triangle the commute runs smooth. On this faithful morning 3 accidents happen simultaneously causing all of Los Angeles to gridlock trapping cars on the freeways for the entire day. A TV Movie in the style of Love Boat and Fantasy Island multiple stories intersect with each other. Funny scenes cute stories.
