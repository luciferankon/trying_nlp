Piquant! Lives of daring outlaws literally out of law and order of this world. The man has no past. What he knows is his name Yamitaro only. He arrives at a totally ruined inn town at the bottom of the Kagerou hill to which he was lured by Ginnosuke a former strolling performer. Yamitaro faces his past in the shattered town where mobs are in power struggle day and night. That was the moment when the first drop of blood starts to form a mighty river. A must see period drama in the style of GEKIDAN SHINKANSEN X KUDOKAN performed by ultra gorgeous cast! *"KAGEROU TOUGE" literally means "a mountain pass named Kagerou".
