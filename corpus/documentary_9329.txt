In the 1970s the Marin Klunkers pioneers of mountain biking shaped the industry with innovations from retrofitting bikes to blazing trails. Twenty years later riders blazed a new sport down the Teton Pass - Freeride Mountain Biking. But this time it was illegal. Nevertheless the sport grew and trails were built. The Forest Service tried to close the trails but the bikers removed the obstacles and continued on only to have the Service again 'close' the trails. Eventually the Teton Pass riders distinguished themselves by reaching out to the Forest Service for a mutually acceptable solution. Through town hall meetings a trail was finally allowed making it the first permitted downhill-specific trail in the country.
