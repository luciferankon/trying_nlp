The documentary looks at the post-Velvet Revolution transition to a market economy using the privatization of Barrandov Studios as a case study. Important actors during these events (V. Marhoul L. Helge J. Knoflícek M. Ondrícek J. Sustr P. Pithart T. Jezek) describe the story of denationalization against the backdrop of the demands of the post-revolutionary period (among other things we are reminded of Milton Friedman's visit to Prague). The film opens with a quote by Karl Jaspers on the purpose of guilt in self-examination and closes with a mediation upon ownership as the art of administrating.
