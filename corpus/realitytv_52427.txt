Who says Sunday evenings are for sleeping? Whilst others may have conked out and gone to sleep MTV is still BANG up for it pumping out all of our best bits in a zone for those with the staying power to squeeze the last drops out of the weekend. With in your face reality drama and docusoaps this is not for the faint hearted! Our new MTV presenter Ash will make sure you don't fall asleep between the shows - the frankly mindboggling line up has Teen Mom My Super Sweet 16 and the brand new Jersey Shore. He will share his musings on wild nights sex tests and his gym routine.
