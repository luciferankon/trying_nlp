The Panamericana is the longest and most fascinating route of the world. The German producer couple Hans and Margit Domnick traveled the American continent by car from 1958 to 1961. As a result the documentary film "Traumstraße der Welt" was released in 1958. The film won the "silver bear" on Berlin international film festival. In 1961 "Traumstraße der Welt - 2. Teil" came into the cinemas. In 1968 Hans Domnik assembled the two parts to the fascinating CinemaScope film "Panamericana - Traumstraße der Welt".
