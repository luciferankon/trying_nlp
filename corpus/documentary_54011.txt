The film is a subjective journey shot as fragmented memories of my country of birth Palestine as I have remembered it throughout my years in exile. Art comes most of the time from the roots. Exile can help an artist to see more clearly in memory what was too close for clarity in actual experience. Palestinian artists in exile who had been away from their birthplace for many years returned again and again to the theme of Palestine as well as Western writers or artists such as James Joyce and Picasso who wrote and painted on the subject of their native countries (Ulysse and the bullfights). My film is above all an encounter with my people intellectuals peasants and workers including my niece Yara whom I have been filming since she was 7 years old. When possible my camera captures her stages of growth on all levels.
