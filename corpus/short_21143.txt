In 1855 in the U.S. South we witness a slave auction at which a boy watches his father beaten. Jump ahead 30 years: in post-Abolitionist America the lad is now a man no longer a slave but humiliated nonetheless when he assists a blind White girl when she loses her balance. An impresario invites him to buy a ticket to see Matilde a Flamenco dancer: the ticket will entitle him to watch her dance and possibly win her favors in a lottery afterwards. Richard dressed in suit and tie goes to the saloon where Matilde dances for a room full of drunks and reprobates. The winning lottery ticket is called. If Richard wins will he claim his prize?
