First- time feature filmmaker Marc Mozga spends three years embedded in a suburban Chicago family's home to chronicle the upbringing of their five year-old autistic son AJ. At his wits end with the outdated reward/ behavior based model of ABA and speech therapy stay-at-home dad Jon discovers strategies on the vanguard of therapy for children with developmental disabilities. The family begins a journey to rebuild the guiding relationship between parent and child which autism has decimated in order to help AJ see the intricacies of the dynamic social world. As much as the film itself strays from documentary convention (no music no narration no interviews) so too does the family find themselves at odds with a special needs community hell bent on the assumption that a person with autism has not the capacity to enjoy a meaningful life.
