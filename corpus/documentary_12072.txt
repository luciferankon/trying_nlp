This documentary captures the human story of separation support and survival. It is an unprecedented and insightful view of one woman's journey of supporting a nation full of "street children" and reuniting them with their mothers. We'll see the stories of the housemothers and social workers who are the vital structure of The Nest. And we'll dive into the worlds of some of the children who are there - those just arriving those who have been there for years and those who are being rejoined with their mothers and society at large. Heartbreaking yet inspiring IN THE NEST goes behind the African curtain of war famine and disease and presents a breathtaking view of the love hope and joy that supports and surrounds those associated with The Nest.
