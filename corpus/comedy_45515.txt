What kind of secrets is this film talking about? There is a bit of everything: murder robbery and treason. With seriousness and a dash of humour Secretos reveals how after a decades-long exile a former left-wing militant returns to Chile to come to terms with his role in the death of a comrade and legendary socialist leader nicknamed the "Voice of the People." But the Chile he knew is no longer. Instead he finds a country where even his old colleagues have changed their stripes.
