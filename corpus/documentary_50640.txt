The Search for the Knysna Elephants Very little is known about the elephants of the Knysna Forest. It is difficult to study an animal that you cannot find; some even doubt their existence. Gareth Patterson started research on these elephants seven years ago with the aim to discover how many actually still remain. In this documentary we follow the search for the proof of these elephants' existence in the Knysna Forest. HONORABLE MENTION: For Graphics & Animation - IWFF 2010
