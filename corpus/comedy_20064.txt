Moja tri zida is a comedy show combining television and theatrical elements and It is developed from the original German TV comedy "Schillerstrasse". Its main feature is the absence of a script. At the beginning of each show the actors are left to improvise after having received a brief description of what is about to happen during the episode. The actors improvise the plot with the help of the game master/dramatist receiving their individual directions through their earpieces. The show is recorded before a live audience that can follow the instructions given to the actors on a large screen mounted above the stage.
