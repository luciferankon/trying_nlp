This fast-paced documentary features a balanced discussion and history of one of the most complex issues in American politics. This even-handed nonpartisan examination of the many facets of the debate journeys beyond myopic sound bites and static polls to a deeply personal exploration capital punishment in America. Interspersed with powerful and rare archival footage and original photographs are exclusive interviews with those most touched by the issue. Innocence deterrence retribution and closure for families are some of the topics explored through the eyes of a "volunteer" on Federal Death and a murderer who narrowly escaped the electric chair in Massachusetts.
