In this twisted fairytale in the tradition of Dr. Seuss and Willy Wonka twins Sammy and Tammy Fitzgivens are forced to play with their bratty neighbor Simon Thaddeus Mulberry Pew (John Kassir voice of Tales from the Crypt's Crypt Keeper). When an accident occurs the "Wizzit" (Deep Space 9's Armin Shimmerman-Quark) magically appears to help clean up the mess... and dispose of the body. Featuring elaborate special effects this comic treat will thrill fans of The Grinch The Cat in the Hat Beetlejuice and A Nightmare Before Christmas!
