HGTV's Property Brothers team up with Food Network talent Duff and Tia Mowry along with Travel Channel's Adam Richman to create not one but two haunted houses with over the top art direction and special effects along with the freakiest of tasty treats and boozy concoctions served up by some not so friendly occupants. The haunted houses will contain secret hallways filled with crawling zombies functioning kitchens where spooky snacks are served and open bars that feature drinks overflowing with dry ice and fire breathing cocktails! The teams will be judged by the Las Vegas public since we will be building these right on the premises of the Linq Hotel on the world famous Strip. The public will then vote on their favorite house based on best d√©cor food cocktails and of course overall fright factor. Best of all the winning team will raise money for the charity of their choice.
