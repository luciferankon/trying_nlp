The story of Buick Riviera is told through fates of two men both Bosnian (ex Yugoslavian) emigrants belonging to the two different religious groups that fought for the city of Sarajevo during the War. One fateful night these two emigrants meet on a deserted road in the middle of America with some unexplainable force bringing them together and the next 24 hours they spend together mentally sabotaging each other and trying to figure out who is guilty of what they change their lives forever without proving anything just like the war itself.
