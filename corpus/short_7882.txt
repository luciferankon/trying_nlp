A group of migrants from the drought areas of Northeastern of Brazil gets a truck "pau-de-arara" trying to move to SÄƒo Paulo and have a better life. Along their travel one of the women delivers a baby on the road. The driver indeed intends to carry them to the slave-work in the fields of a powerful "colonel" but the brave Ana faces the foreman of the farm and the driver and the truck follows to the hired final destination.
