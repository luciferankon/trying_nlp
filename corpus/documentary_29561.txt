The Federal Trade Commission has laws and regulatory standards governing "Truth in Advertising" - with significant financial and legal penalties for those who would willfully misrepresent a product or service. But what standards does the F.C.C. have to hold broadcast and cablecast "news" programs to a standard of truthfulness? As our nation struggles to accept and recover from the Russian cyber attack that corrupted the 2016 Presidential election - many questions arise: How did cable news cater to the Russian agenda? Why were demonstrably false stories repeated hourly until truth became disposable? Why can't there a standard of accuracy and truthfulness that "news" programs are required to meet - or else face financial legal and licensing penalties? TRUTH IS NOT A FOUR-LETTER WORD is a powerful exploration into the decline of honor in broadcast news - a feature documentary that delves into these questions and more with insightful interviews from top media professionals and regulatory experts.
