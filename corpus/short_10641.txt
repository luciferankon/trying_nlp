The film centers around an absurd conversation between two men. They have created a fictional reality in which movie narratives stand for literal representations of the world and it's functioning. While making a list of things they still want to do before they die the word Death is replaced with the word Satisfaction. The switch marks their departure away from first hand experience into the virtual realm where time and space are redefined next to other established notions and meanings. The third character in the film which keeps interrupting the conversation becomes the higher calling to return to the real and the primal elements of one's existence.
