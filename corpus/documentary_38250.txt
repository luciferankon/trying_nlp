In 1986 in the heart of Ukraine the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded releasing 400 times more radiation than the Hiroshima Bomb. Hastily a "sarcophagus" was built to contain the radioactive materials that lingered at the site after the explosion. However 30 years later the sarcophagus is crumbling and another disaster at Chernobyl looms. Now an international team of engineers is racing the clock to assemble one of the most ambitious superstructures ever built-an extraordinary 40000 ton $1.5 billion dome to encase the crumbling remains of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor. Battling arctic winter weather-and lethal radiation-this is the inside story of the epic race to build Chernobyl's Mega Tomb.
