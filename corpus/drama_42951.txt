Set once upon a time on a remote Irish island buffeted by relentless Atlantic storms a simple peasant couple long to have a child in a universe that seems to be conspiring against them. Having already delivered three stillborn babies to the childless couple the old midwife scolds the disconsolate Man that one more pregnancy could be fatal to his wife. Despite him giving up the notion of ever having a family of their own his devout and loving Wife is still willing to try again leaving it up to God's will to provide. Feeling cursed over their plight in life the Man suddenly senses a shift in the universe when a forsaken infant enters their lives only to destine them to tragedy and myth.
