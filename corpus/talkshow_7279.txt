Koppel's probing interview covers the three-time Tony Award winner's challenging portrayal of Richard Nixon in "Frost/Nixon" and many other roles. Langella's love for the process of filmmaking and his take on being able to trust the director's vision is revealed. Langella reflects on how an actor learns to inhabit characters both famous and infamous. Also how he transforms the actor's role from the stage and screen and applies it to life by discovering the rewards of doing the "things that frighten you rather than taking the easy road."
