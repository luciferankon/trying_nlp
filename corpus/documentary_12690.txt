In the middle of German back province the Hindu priest Sri Paskaran has built the biggest Tamil Hindu temple in Europe. It was founded in 2002 amidst industrial plants in the Westphalian village Hamm-Uentrop. The film accompanies the priests busy life during the preparations for the annual temple festival with 20.000 believers expected. In the neighborhood the German locals cultivate their own traditions but also support the Hindus in their own way. Irene sells Bratwurst in the local snack-bar while farmer Exsternbrink tends to a holy cow in his barn. An encounter of two opposite but peacefully coexisting worlds.
