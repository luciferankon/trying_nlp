An Italian football club consisting only of African refugees is ascending into the Italian Professional Leagues. KOA Bosco FC was founded by priest Don Roberto Maduri in order to relieve racial tension between the local Calabrese and the large influx of African refugees. With an already widespread rate of unemployment in Calabria the team has faced many hardships including homelessness racial attacks and the strong opposing presence of the 'Ndrangheta mafia syndicate. The players continue to play the team continues to rise and Don Roberto's experiment can hopefully become something of a bridge across a heated racial and nationalistic divide and maybe play some of Italy's best footballers in the process.
