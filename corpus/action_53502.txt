The Duke cousins must help Hazzard County's local foster home to pay off its debt in order to remain operational. Boss Hogg has raised the mortgage price for the orphanage and is having the interest compounded hourly. He's doing this to fund the building of a statue of himself to be located in the town square and to build a local water reservoir on the site of the foster home's location with the help of Rosco. The player must help the Dukes complete a series of tasks in order to save the foster home before it gets shut down completely. There is a free roam feature which allows the player to drive across all of Hazzard County and enjoy the freedom of ramping the General Lee on various objects in order to unlock hidden objects in this game.
