Universal's answer to and "knock-off" of the "Quiz Kids" on radio film shorts and later television. Jack Barry was the resident host-moderator presenting questions to five kids usually on a single subject. The subject in this entry (Universal production number 2363) was "child training." The running time was always about ten minutes on all of these (11 in this one) as ten minutes was about as long as any audience could tolerate these kids.
