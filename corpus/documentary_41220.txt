China is a manufacturing colossus. Britons are surrounded by products sporting the legend 'Made in China'. Gok Wan returns to his ancestral home to explore the largely unseen world of Chinese mass production meeting the people working in the factories that supply the West. He visits the village his father grew up in for the first time as part of a journey of discovery round a country that now produces one in every four man-made objects on the planet. Gok goes to 'Jeans Town' 'Bra Town' the factory that makes London cabs and 'Thames Town' as well as to ultra-modern Shanghai where he meets a stylist pushing the boundaries in Chinese fashion.
