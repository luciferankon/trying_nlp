Christine - a picture restorer - is terminally ill. While being cared for by those who love her she fades in and out of consciousness remembering things past and imagining herself being reunited in the afterworld with her late husband. Around this main theme the film wraps a scenography of excuisite beauty coupled with references to artists such as Leonardo da Vinci Italo Calvino and Sofonisba Anguissola in order to explore the impermanence of human existance.
