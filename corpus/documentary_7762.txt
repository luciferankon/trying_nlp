Anti-racism expert Jane Elliott leads her renowned workshop in discrimination in this documentary that challenges Canadian attitudes towards Native Canadians and exposes systematic racism in Canada. Jane Elliott divides the 22 Canadians attending the workshop into two groups - the "blue eyes" and the "brown eyes" - and then discriminates against the blue eyes thus creating a microcosm of society which teaches the blue eyes what it is like to be a target of discrimination. The intensity of the situation and the confrontational techniques force the participants to re-evaluate their behavior and to examine new ways to interact.
