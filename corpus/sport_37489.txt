I've always been a huge believer in walking to stay slim and healthy. Walking burns a lot of calories and slims the waistline while also improving brain function and increasing both your heart and lung health. This includes two one-mile walking workouts that are simple fun and fat-burning. Stick with me and do this WALKOUT regularly - you will be healthier and feel energized! Remember it's never too late to start.
