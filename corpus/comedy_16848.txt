'No Point' is a comedy about tennis ambition and getting the ball over the net... Ben is an avid tennis player. Barnaby is his hopelessly determined coach. Both of them have their eyes firmly set on Wimbledon. Could Ben's underarm serve make him the first English man to lift the trophy for 77 years? The series follows the progress of Ben Barnaby and their (recently bankrupt) business manager James as the three of them go about making the (un)necessary preparations for Ben's future glory.
