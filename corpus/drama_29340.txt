A boy makes an unusual and dangerous friend in this family drama. Aaron McGregor (Devin Douglas Drewitz) is a young boy who after the death of his parents goes to live with his aunt and uncle in a rural community. Aaron feels like an outcast in his new home not accepted by his schoolmates and receiving little in the way of support or affection from his Aunt Rebecca (Marthe Keller). One of the few things that comforts Aaron is the sound of a pack of wolves who howl on the prairies late in the night. When a band of farmers attempt to kill the animals Aaron discovers one is still alive and he attempts to nurse the survivor back to health. However while Aaron is happy with his new friend he learns the hard way that keeping a wolf under wraps is no easy task.
