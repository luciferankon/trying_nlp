On their last night in Thailand Danny Jenkins and the rest of the Tsunami rebuilding team are in a steamy Phuket girlie bar. Danny heads back to the hotel alone. He can't sleep and the air-conditioners crashed so he heads for the pool. Muffled sobs a lonely Claudia cries in the shadows. They both share the loneliness. Two weeks later back in Byron Bay; Danny's wife Jodie answers a call. Claudia informs Danny she's diagnosed HIV positive and begs money for treatment. Danny's not well.
