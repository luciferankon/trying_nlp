In 2002 John and Lucinda traveled from Santa Fe to New York City for a combined business and pleasure trip. Soon after their arrival they became extremely ill and were rushed to a hospital where they were diagnosed with Bubonic Plague. Due to concerns about possible bio-terrorism John and Lucinda were isolated under intense security and became an international news item. John was placed in a coma and given a one per cent chance of survival. Lucinda recovered quickly but remained in New York at John's side while he battled for his life.
