Crush is the story of a man who wants to turn into animal as told by the man himself and one or two observers. He employs a variety of techniques to transform himself into a beast. He cuts off parts of his body. He exercises. He swims. He wants to return to the water; to speed up evolution a little. Has he gone mad or is he just tired of being human?
