Three separate lives and three separate stories set against the ever-changing backdrop of the Las Vegas Valley. Marcus is a grieving husband and father trying to recover from his daughter's death and can only hope to save his failing marriage. Dani is a troubled hairdresser from Arizona who has come to Las Vegas to start anew. Madison is a 'bible thumping stripper with a heart of gold'. She believes 'she is doing the Lord's work' in one of the 'darkest' places of Las Vegas. All the while she cares for her sick grandfather. The story of how these lives eventually cross meet and affect one another is the premise of A Different Corner.
