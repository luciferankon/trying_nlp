The Shower is a short film aimed at comparing relational methods between individuals in two generations. The teenage generation rocked by the rise of computer and related technologies and the generation before more inclined to direct and frontal human relationships. "The Shower" is a light comedy whose final message is to be open to others and human relationships for more understanding and cohesion with each other. No dramatic scope nor dramatist. The final message should be: "Nothing will ever replace the human relationship listening and attention are paramount. Live slower turn off your computers and laptops and stay attentive to your loved one. ".
