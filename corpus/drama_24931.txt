It was the biggest sports scandal of the 20th Century. With over 100 athletes signed to his sports agency Tank Black was a bona-fide super agent. He was the first agent in history to represent 5 first round draft picks taken in a single draft... and he did it twice! However a series of selfish and miscalculated decisions ultimately led to his demise; paying players laundering for drug dealers a ponzi scheme obstruction of justice and siphoning over 15M dollars away from his players in shady investments. All of which brought the most powerful black sports management agency down in flames; losing his clients his money his reputation and ultimately his freedom. But it all wasn't what it seemed. Tank Black is a gripping story about how for some having it all only makes you want more! That's life in the fast lane.
