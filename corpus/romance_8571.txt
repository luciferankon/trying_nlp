A group of Roman misfits spend the fall minding a vintage shop called Twinkled a business that is failing in every way but in spirit. The owner strives to keep the store afloat even as his wife insists that he sell the place and get a real job. One day a beautiful young woman named Camilla takes a job cleaning the store and her presence has a profound effect on the lives of everyone including Stefano the well-meaning but unorganized shopkeeper and Gigio Camilla's loving younger brother who has Down's syndrome.
