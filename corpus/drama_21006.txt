Etsuko - a typical Japanese high school student who's unlucky in love an academic failure and plain bored with life. That's until one day the view of a boat gliding gracefully in the sea inspires her to take up the oar. Since she's rejected by her school's all-male rowing team she decides to form her own all-women team. Nothing will ever be the same again.
