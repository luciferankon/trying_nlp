In 2005 15-year old Agnesa Murselaj and her mother both Kosovan Roma refugees are seized in a dawn raid and remanded whilst waiting deportation. Six of Agnesa's fellow pupils - both immigrant and native Scot - at Drumchapel High School in Glasgow are outraged and fashion a petition to stop proceedings. This grows into a fully-blown campaign to end dawn raids and the incarceration of minors which the girls take to the Scottish National Parliament winning huge support along the way and garnering them the Scottish Campaign of the Year award. Agnesa's expulsion is halted and five years later the girls' victory is accomplished when the national government puts an end to impromptu raids and the detention in remand centres of minors.
