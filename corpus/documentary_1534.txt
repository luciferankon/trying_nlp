THE HOCKEY NOMAD is based on Dave Bidini's best selling book Tropic of Hockey. Dave's quest takes him far from the corporate branded arenas and millionaire players of professional hockey to lesser-known rinks in Dubai Transylvania and Mongolia. In each locale he explores the origin of the local game and meets the eccentric and passionate people who play it.
