Despite past friendliness cattle ranchers Tom and Jim Bledsoe father and son fence off their range to prevent its use by neighboring sheep ranchers Tug Wilson and Buck Rankin suggesting that they hope to end their recent loss of cattle. Rankin (not Rankins) shoots Tug who is unaware of Rankin's lawless activities in an argument and Jim is accused of murder and also stampeding the sheep. Believing Jim is guilty Tug's daughter Ruth aids Buck in capturing Jim but he escapes. Ruth gets help from Sheriff Hank Bosley and a sheepherder Sanchez reveals Rankin's responsibility for both the rustling of Bledsoe's cattle and the killing of Wilson.
