In the future (1999) the UK is subdivided into two regions by barbed wire and border patrols. Northern Britain is cold bleak and impoverished while sunny South Britain is a place of relative luxury. When Lord Tewkesbury the owner of rich conglomerate decides his son Giles needs more real-life experience he arranged for Giles to work under an assumed name. Unfortunately this results in Giles being sent to North Britain to do menial labor while previously impoverished Gavin is transferred to sunny South Britain.
