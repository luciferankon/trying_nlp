A German translation of the hit American play Visiting Mr. Green Besuch bei Mr. Green tells the story of an old man who is almost run over by a car. The young man who was driving the car receives a community service sentence of having to visit the old man once a month for six months. What begins as a comedy of two men who don't want to spend any time together grows intense as they get to know each other and play out some unfinished family business they each have with each other.
