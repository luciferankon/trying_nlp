Interlude happens in this transitional state prior to the onset of sleep when we are neither awake nor asleep both an apt setting for a unique story--a sui generis blend of science fiction and oneiric surrealism--and a pregnant metaphor that hints at some of the deepest questions about life art and their relations to say nothing of space and time. But 'Interlude' avoids getting mired in the trappings of those genres though its seriousness about ideas morality as well as the elements of good cinema and drama.
