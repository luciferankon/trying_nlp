Gang leader Wagner is taking ranchers land with phony deeds forged by Leavitt. When Hanson and Lynch investigate the gang puts Lynch on a runaway wagon and then they shoot Hanson. But Hanson was not shot and he had previously saved Lynch. The two supposedly dead men now await the gangs next move. The cow town of Ardmore is the headquarters of a gang of forgers who by false documents are gaining control of Lonesome Valley. Rancher Steve Hanson suspects saloon keeper Jake Wagner heads the gang and he secretly sends for government investigator Jim Lynch. Retta Lowery goes to church with her young brother Sonny Lowery and finds the minister has been slain. Lynch posing as a tramp is thrown off the train and Steve saves him from Wagner confederate Peter Starr. Steve and Lynch search the church for clues and find a tunnel under the floor. While Steve investigates the tunnel Lynch is captured by Wagner's henchmen who plan to get rid of him by tying him to a runaway. Steve learns the tunnel merges into the saloon but is discovered by Wagner. They fight and Steve knocks him out and then rescues Lynch in such a manner that the crooks think he was killed.
