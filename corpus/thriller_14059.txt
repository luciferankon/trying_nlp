Aaron Anderson wants to make a scary movie. He's a driven young filmmaker who sees the horror genre as his path to fame and fortune - and a local legendary haunted house seems like the perfect location. So Aaron gathers three willing friends as his cast and crew packs his car with cameras and gear and sets out to make a name for himself. Everyone is prepared and rehearsed to play up the fear and "act scared" so that they are guaranteed to leave the house with their scary movie. But the house has other ideas. And we - in the audience - begin to watch a scary movie about people making a scary movie which refuses to follow the script.
