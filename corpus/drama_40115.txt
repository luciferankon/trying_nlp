Filmed in stunning black and white this immersive dive into the lives of the people of Quelepa El Salvador is a tour de force of experimentation along the lines of the work of Mexican surrealist director Carlos Reygadas (SILENT LIGHT POST TENEBRAS LUX) an ethnographic slice of life as vibrant as it is enigmatic. As we spend time with our central character we slowly peel back the layers of his daily life and experiences catching glimpses of life in a small mountain village teeming with history.
