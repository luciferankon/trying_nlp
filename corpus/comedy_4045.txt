Majka and Kacper are a young couple going through their first serious crisis. After a squabble with her boyfriend she decides to get a tattoo on her belly [hence the title of the movie] as a sign of her independence. Kacper is not pleased with Majka's decision which causes more tensions between them and gets more people involved mainly because of nosy next door neighbor who listens to every word they say through "paper-thin" walls and Kacper's father serving him ill advice being a bitter man himself still dealing with a divorce from fifteen years ago.
