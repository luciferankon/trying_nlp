For a look at the predator's arsenal this set offers "weapons analysis clips". They cover "Gauntlet Knives" "Self Destruct" "Plasma Cannon" "Net Launcher" "Smart Weapon" and "Telescoping Spear". We hear remarks from Hopkins and Rosengrant. They get into the design of various weapons and how they were made to seem real in the film.
