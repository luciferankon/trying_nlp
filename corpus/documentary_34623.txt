In 1941 the writers Louis Aragon and Elsa Triolet fled the Nazi-occupied zone of France arriving in Nice. There they met and befriended Henri Matisse. Aragon resolved to write a book about the grat painter but it wasn't until 1970 just after Elsa's death that he finally completed "Henri Matisse roman".
