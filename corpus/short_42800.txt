This exposee of the children's television program Bumpity is not simply a documentary it should be called a retro-docu-fantasy. Bumpity was a program in the 70's and 80's that aired in Oregon and Southwest Washington. After Bumpity and friends were retired they were marooned in a suitcase for 15 years until childhood fan Crispin Rosenkranz persuaded puppeteer Bob Griggs to resurrect his TV friends. Some call it a subversive expose of how television programming is made. Others declare it a generous and thoughtful examination of the playful world of puppets and dreams. Everyone agrees that Bumpity touched the hearts of thousands of children during the 14 years it was broadcast on KATU-TV in Portland Oregon. And then one day it was gone. Letters to the station manager and protests on the streets outside the television station did no good. The station outgrew it said the former director. They lied to my fans and said I wanted to retire declared the creator and puppeteer. "Now I spend most of my time hanging around in the suitcase" sadly recounts Bumpity. Bumpity Returns will reassure former children that their TV stars haven't abandoned them and that dreams really can come true.
