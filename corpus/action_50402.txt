Welcome back to the 20th century for a story that actually occurred 100 years in the making. The time before Twitter Facebook and The Google. A time when people drank smoked and led very short and exciting lives. About two guys from Kansas: one was destined to be President and the other was destined to save the universe. In the 1950's the U.S. Government assembled a crack team of agents to investigate close encounters of the truly incomprehensible. This is the actual story of one of them Agent Frank Skuddler of Project Blue Book.
