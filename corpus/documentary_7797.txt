The story takes us to Nairobi National Park where David and Daphne Sheldrick established a sanctuary for orphaned elephants. The bond between the keepers and the Ivory Orphans gradually develops as the keepers sleep with the animals to calm the nightmares that they experience as a result of the trauma of losing their parents. We see how their personalities develop over the months in the compound.
