In 1936 a right-wing military coup tried to overthrow the new legally elected democratic government of Spain. Hitler and Mussolini quickly joined the fight on the side of the fascist military. In response and against the wishes of the U.S. government about 80 American women joined over 2700 of their countrymen to volunteer for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. This film is composed of interviews with and excerpts from the letters journals and published writings of some of these women as well as of supporters and sympathizers including Martha Gellhorn Eleanor Roosevelt Virginia Cowles Josephine Herbst and Dorothy Parker.
