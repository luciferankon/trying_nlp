Sappada is a linguistic enclave of the Plodar dialect which is spoken in the Carnian Alps in northern Italy. The black and white film documentation centers around Giuliana who returned home to her parents' Bellavista hotel in Sappada after having stayed abroad studied German after two serious accidents and her brothers' suicide. Searching for creative space as redemption she reflects upon the inner conflict in her life feels that the dialect can be seen as a "home". Bellavista is far away from being an ethnographic study as Schreiner links Giulianas perception with her extraordinary environment.
