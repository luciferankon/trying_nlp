In Jerusalem a group called LYRIS meets once a month to share their poems in German. Only a few members are under 85 years old. As of recently however young Israelis are once again learning German. The film tells both stories: that of an intense and painful experience and of a not entirely impartial curiosity. And so a space for dialogue is formed across generations - and the language is German.
