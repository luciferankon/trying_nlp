Traditionally a way to add proteins to the Bedouins' meager diet falcon hunting has become nowadays one of the favored sports of the Arab peninsula's sheiks. The birds are now captive bred and selected to create the most resistant and performing hybrids. The falcon is also the national emblem of the United Arab Emirates where an exceptionally advanced veterinary facility was created the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital. Guided by the utmost hospitable director German-born Dr. Margit Muller we discover a day in the life of the hospital during the molting time of the year when temperatures are extremely high and falcons are most delicate and cannot be employed for hunting.
