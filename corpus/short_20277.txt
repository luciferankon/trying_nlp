Leo a middle-aged single man lives in Taipei. He goes around town by subway. When the subway train gets into a tunnel Leo pretends the tunnel is a wormhole. Leo likes to see and make movies as well. A movie he is shooting is about "see" vs. "seen"; also pretending and dancing. He tries to find friends on the Internet but can't find any. Leo goes to the gym and tries to become stronger. However his left leg is a big problem for weight training. One night an imaginary friend Mr. L (Louie) comes to his house and promises him a miracle: the crippled Leo becomes a dancer. Leo is not sure if he should trust Mr. L. It seems like in a parallel universe that there are two people who look exactly like Leo and Louie.
