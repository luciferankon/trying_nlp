One man's long dark night of the soul is poetically captured in Besides These Walls a monologue-driven drama from director Jules Bishop (Borrowed Time). Following the languorous meditations of an alcoholic man as he trawls through his memories thoughts and regrets Bishop's experimental-realist hybrid is meditative and atmospheric filmmaking. Shot entirely in East London Besides These Walls takes in locations such as Balfron Tower Crisp Street Market and a variety of E14 backstreets rarely seen on the big screen and isn't only a gripping portrait of a man in crisis but a thrillingly risk taking work of internalised drama.
