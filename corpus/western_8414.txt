A virtual remake of among several others two Ken Maynard films "Fightin' Thru 1930" and "Fargo Express 1933" and credited Story writer Forest Sheldon and credited Screenplay writer Carl Krusada didn't even nod in the direction of the original writer Jack Natteford other than keeping many of the original character role-names from "Fightin' Thru" such as "Alice Malden" "Queenie" "Ace Brady" and "Fox Tyson." They changed Maynard's character name from "Dan Barton" to "Bob Barton" to fit Bob Steele and Wallace MacDonald's original "Tennessee Malden" to "Texas Malden" to fit the new title of "The Pal From Texas." The helped along when they didn't have to waste a lot of time thinking up new character names from lifted plots.
