Russell Stuckley is a lovable yet socially awkward book clerk. He doesn't have real friends or family nor the greatest of people skills - Russell has books - hundreds of them in his Seattle apartment above Prufrock Bookseller; an independent book shop in Pioneer Square. Russell is content working and living amongst his books. Looking out for Russell's best interests are a few of his loyal fictional friends Lizzie Bennet Holden Caulfield and Atticus Finch. Literally. They are his family - annoying bickering encouraging and nagging but always with love. Feeling that something is missing Russell's friends encourage him to look beyond his insular world for the first time. Not wanting to venture too far from his comfort zone Russell joins not one but four book clubs full of eccentrics. He is about to lose hope and retreat back to the haven he has built for himself - When suddenly like a flash of lightening from the dark Seattle sky he meets Abby! At first glance Abby is the picture of perfection in Russell's mind. With her flowing red hair and captivating smile she is the "Daisy" to his "Gatsby." Yet reality Russell learns is even more complicated than fiction. When things get challenging - will Russell's fictional friends allow him to retreat back into his safe world of books? Or will Russell choose a reality with Abby one that allows them to write their own story.
