Jessica and Kristel (who both work as flight attendants) Maxime Babette Mirte and Tamara prepare a surprise party in an empty country estate. But none of the girls are very bright and they screw everything up. Tension gets higher when the owner of the estate a masked murderer that hates women suddenly appears and tries to put an end to the festivities. During a lot of silly chasing and comic fighting (where every girl loses her cap shoes or displays her bare belly) they manage to overpower him and turn him over to the police. But troubles are not done when Amber a former member that was kicked out because of her arrogant character discovers the party and decides to crash it. The effort to get rid of her results in more clumsy chasing wacky fighting (with the girls losing their caps or showing their bare bellies again) and finally a hilarious pie fight whereupon they accept Amber back.
