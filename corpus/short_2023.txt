Time lapse photography shows the swarm of commuters at London Waterloo station racing about at top speed. A man speeds through a hot dog and coffee. The trains move at a breakneck pace. At normal speed we see the men who run things remotely by pulling levers. A ticking clock and wacky music alternate on the soundtrack.
