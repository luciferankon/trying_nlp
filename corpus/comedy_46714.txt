Pensioner Ron and son Simon head off on a camping trip despite neither of them having slept in a tent since a disastrous holiday in Bridlington 30 years ago. Ron is hoping for a relaxing break with a spot of fishing Simon with a good book. All is going according to plan until a tent is pitched alongside theirs by chatterboxes Jill and Michelle which promptly stamps out any tranquility. This is not quite the outdoor experience any of them envisaged but as they all appear to have their own reasons to stay put they stick it out. With each of them burdened with life's sorrows will any of them find the peace they are truly searching for? And will Ron ever catch a fish? Full of laughter tears tenderness and a dollop of campsite capers.
