The short film Az ég kék éve (Blue Year of the Sky) is a vision of a young man which is difficult to describe an inside vision of the happiness of the awakening consciousness. At the age of twenty a young man awakens to see images of the beauty of the world of the eternity of unifying physical and spiritual pleasures. He dresses these pictures in light with his friend the cameraman in light gained from strength and beauty which points beyond them surpasses them. However it is given to them to walk the road of the beautiful light passing its stages of sensual pleasure and spiritual pain both of which appear in the pictures because a picture is able to organize and interpret the phenomena of life in a cognitive motion. It compares what is comparable and directs what is the different in the same direction. The happiness of the awakening consciousness is nothing but finding the ultimate identity.
