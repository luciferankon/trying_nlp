One woman wants to be accepted by her friends. Another wants the love and acceptance of her mother. One woman hates herself so much that she begins loving crack cocaine. Another woman longs for the love of a husband and lastly one woman finds out that the love she's committed to is not truly love. Each woman has one thing in common: they all want to be loved. Nevertheless each woman's path while different leads her to the same place: back in the presence of Jesus.
