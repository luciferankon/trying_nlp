61: Highway to Hell tells the story of an LA rock band (Richter Scale) made up more of dreamers than musicians. The band members in their early 30's and still working at menial jobs are getting desperate. They are no closer to becoming the next Rolling Stones now than they were five years ago when they first formed. And time and talent are not on their side. Their manager in a last ditch effort to keep the band from breaking up convinces the guys that it's time to follow in the footsteps of the rock gods that have gone before. He convinces them that the only thing standing between them and super-stardom is a deal with the Devil. So borrowing an RV from one of their uncles Richter Scale hits the road on an epic cross-country journey in search of a sacrificial black cat groupies and a date with the Prince of Darkness whom they hope awaits them at the mythical Crossroads of Mississippi.
