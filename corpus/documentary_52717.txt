Once An Immigrant follows Canadian actor Peter Keleghan as he embarks on a journey of discovery - brandishing his playful sense of humour and irony to track the history of the Irish diaspora in Canada. He starts his journey in Canada before moving on to Ireland looking for what his family left behind. Using baggage as a metaphor for the inherited weight carried by an immigrant's ethnic legacy it uses spiky discussion personal encounters and clever animation to simplify but never diminish the immigrant's task of establishing Canada as home. It starts in the now goes back and over there and comes back to Canada on the cusp of 2017.
