This documentary provides insight on the sexuality of Australians with a variety of disabilities. I have worked with Americans with disabilities for almost 40 years. I was pleasantly surprised at how progressive Australia was two decades ago when this film was released. Some of the interviewees who use wheelchairs spoke about how it would be most difficult to engage in sex with another wheelchair user because both of them have mobility disabilities. Several of the people who have severe disabilities mentioned how they would be unable to experience sex without assistance from people who do not have disabilities. Though some of those interviewed were heterosexual some preferred sexual interaction with people of the same gender. This film was enlightening way ahead of its time.
