"Who's going to cook the tea?" and "Pay for sex?" While Eric invites a goat into the living room to keep him company Harry calls a prostitute. Meanwhile mum is spinning in her grave then she rises from the dead and begins walking toward the house where her lads a goat and a strumpet unknowingly await her verdict.
