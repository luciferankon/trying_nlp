Made for "about the cost of the average funeral" comes an all new batch of supernatural revenge stories and cont√© cruels in the tradition of the original "Tales From The Crypt" and "Creepshow". Bestselling horror novelist Claire Huston (Dawn Duvurger) has a sure way of producing creepy story after story - she steals them from a dead master of the macabre using a spirit board. What follows are four stories of suspense and terror... though not without consequence. Alice (Mona Duvera) encounters an all-too familiar ventriloquist doll; Bobby (Amber Peach) knows something is watching her from within the walls of her home; a crazed sniper (Eric Spudic) uses geocaching as a lure for his victim (Krystal Stevenson Akin); and a man (J.C. Pennylegion) attempts to resurrect his dead wife brought to him by two grave robbers (Denman Powers Kirk Jordan).
