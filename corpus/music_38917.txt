Anywhere but Home is the first live album and DVD by the rock band Evanescence released in 2004. It includes all four of their Fallen music videos an hour of behind the scenes features and a recording of a concert at Le ZÃ©nith in Paris. It also includes a previously unreleased song on the CD titled "Missing" (which also plays during the DVD credits); while placed at the end of the disc the CD insert shows it as track eight however it is actually track 14 and incorrectly labeled "Whisper".
