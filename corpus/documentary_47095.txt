In July of 1991 two school buses filled with drag queens and social outcasts were charted by the infamous Ryan Landry in order to take a trip to the Barnstable County Fair. The buses left from the tip of Cape Cod from the Provincetown Inn. Along the way the majority of passengers took psychedelic drugs and consumed copious amounts of alcohol. Upon arriving the group of merry-men and merry-women descended upon the unsuspecting suburbanite fair goers of early 1990's Cape Cod. The documentary is laced with sideways glances from patrons and near-arrests by the local law enforcement. Everyone did make it safely back on board both buses but not without incident.
