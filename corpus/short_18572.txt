When best friends Gavin and Milo quit their jobs and impulsively head out onto the road they begin a road trip that quickly turns surreal. Guided by a ghostly DJ they wander through to desert eventually finding themselves at the abandoned Detour Diner. Here they meet another wandering soul Rebecca. She's travelling in the opposite direction but is similarly lost. When all three collide their destinies (and destinations) change forever.
