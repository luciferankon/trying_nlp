Francis has just changed his new fish's water and the fish is freaking out. Francis calls a pal who tells him the fish needs salt water not fresh water and hasn't long to live; so Francis sets out fish in fresh water in a plastic bag to save it. He must first find his car deal with an unsympathetic vet tape a leaky bag get to a pet store where he confronts the manager and the manager's bouncer stare into the eyes of a helpful clerk who offers ocean salt and then hightail it for the beach. Luckily Francis lives in L.A. Will the fish drown before Francis gets it to the sea? Wave good-by.
