A sitcom about a widower who is trying his best to bring up his three teenage daughters with the help of his sister from Bilaspur. While traditional Bilaspur values propagated that girls should oil their hair and wear shapeless clothes modern cosmopolitan values demanded parties boys and fun. The tussle between the two was treated in a funny manner but with an underlying thread of caring and warmth touched the hearts of young and old.
