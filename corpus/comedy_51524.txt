Vance Gordon is a director making a mafia movie despite setbacks like quitting actors a cinematographer who has not read the script and a crew member thinking he would be better in the director's chair. Oh did we mention that the craft services dude Chicago ends up playing the lead? But his role is perhaps short-lived unless he can save the film crew who has been taken hostage by Hollywood superstar Richard Lynch. Can Chicago save the day? Perhaps if he does what any good actor does. He must improvise. Silicon Valley-based director Shawn Flanagan stars in this comedy about a San Jose Calif. filmmaker's hapless attempts to make a mob movie amid escalating chaos. With no money to speak of and the most famous cast member (Richard Lynch) holding the rest of the crew hostage director Vance Gordon is determined to make his movie -- even if that means putting the craft services guy in the leading role.
