Each day 60000 people are served a free meal at the historic Sikh site of the 'Golden Temple' in Amritsar India using the community itself to create the meal which is shared by all. What motivates people of diverse backgrounds to do such service? How is so much food prepared each day? Where does the food come from? Take a look behind the scenes to examine the intimate details of this fascinating place that has been providing free meals barrier-free for over 400 years. The crew (Teresa and Jasprit Singh from Santa Barbara) was granted unprecedented access to this historic and holy site to document the Sikh practice of Langar Free Community Kitchen in ways it has not been examined before filming events all through the night and day providing a view of the remarkable practices used to build and direct energy and passion in the volunteers. For the past 5 years Teresa and Jasprit have been bringing research groups in sustainability nutrition public policy and related fields documenting this practice and bringing American students for month-long study tours to fully participate: making the food serving the meals cleaning up and enjoying the meals themselves. The participation and examination all leads to the question: What best practices can modern world absorb from this traditional practice of sustainable nourishment and community building? The issues addressed in this inspiring place meet not only our hunger for food but also our hunger to belong.
