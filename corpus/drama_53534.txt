The film transports us to the time of White Terror of 1923-1925 when the fascist regime of Alexander Tzankov assassinated thousands of progressive people in Bulgaria. The list of those who 'disappeared without trace' includes members of the Communist Party but also liberal intellectuals such as the journalist Yossif Herbst the member of Parliament Todor Strashimirov brother of the famous writer Anton Strashimirov the poets Geo Milev and Hristo Yasenov and many teachers and artists. The film opens with the following inscription:" The resemblance to real people is not coincidental. The names and events are not imaginary.' This is a documentary evidence presented in artistic terms about the heinous crimes in Bulgaria during the 1920s. In 1953 the remains were discovered of several people who had been killed without charge or trial. The assassins were brought to trial. Each crime is associated with a separate retrospective line. The individual case histories fit into a larger picture of a period in Bulgarian history that has been branded with infamy.
