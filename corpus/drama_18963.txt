Some people were born to change the world. Others should just stay home. Such is the premise of UN33DHELP an independent dramatic comedy set in Richmond VA in the summer of 2006. Meet James a loner with mixed-up values who takes it upon himself to even the score with the dreaded frat boys whom he feels are responsible for every misery experienced in the world. A serial killer who is trying to quit James has to make the choice: Do I stay anonymous and never evolve into a better human being? Or do I instead turn myself in and try to improve the world in another way? Watch as James sees a psychiatrist and winds up helping her more than she helps himself. And finally meet Lee Singer the front man for his headlining band "Lee Singer and the Imaginary Band." Lee hopes that his dreams will help inspire others to achieve theirs. He has one major problem though. The band doesn't really exist and he can't even headline for open stage. His fans don't exist either. They are all figments of Lee's imagination. In a tragic struggle of dreams vs. reality Lee must face up to his limitations. But not before one last stab at stardom for a producer who also may not even exist. Does he need help? Why don't you ask his imaginary girlfriend who is cheating on him with the imaginary drummer the imaginary bassist AND the imaginary background vocalist! Lee is the perfect example of someone who helps others when he should pay better attention to himself.
