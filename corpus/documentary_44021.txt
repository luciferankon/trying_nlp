Our generation has gained a bad reputation as couch sitting video game playing lazy kids. We want to be trail blazers for our peers: going where our elders have gone before us in a similar way that they did. Over a span of 28 days Dan Alden and Mike will be traveling over 8500 miles across America. While trying to be as cost efficient as possible and seeing all the national parks on the way we will be driving from Pittsburgh PA to the Pacific Ocean and back to Dallas Texas. While visiting the natural beauties of the United States we will be conducting a two-fold experiment; how cheaply can one see the sights of America and do people still have it in their hearts to help a few adventurers out?
