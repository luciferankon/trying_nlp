Laya (Che Ramos) is a young professional photographer who has drifted away from her family. Her father has fallen ill but she hasn't once come to visit him at the hospital -though she paid for hospital. Her mother who left their family when Laya was a child returns to urge Laya to make amends with her father but Laya's pain goes deeper than her mother suspects. Laya is sent to the provinces to document a ritual of a disappearing indigenous tribe and there she inadvertently comes face to face with her own demons as she observes the relationships of the last remaining members of this dying culture.
