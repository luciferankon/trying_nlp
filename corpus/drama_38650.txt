The world of organized crime is far from dead in 21st-century America yet one young daredevil known only as the Scarlet Pimpernel is slowly but surely infiltrating the darkest depths of inner-city drug rings to rescue victims and addicts. Caught up in hero-worship of a man brave enough to stand up against immorality and injustice yet still dogged by the choking influences of her late father's illegal dealings all Margot James wants is to get away from her past and start a new life for her sister. But when romance starts to blossom in an unlikely place and a regrettable decision earns her the pursuit of her biggest dream Margot's fairy-tale ending seems a little too good to be true. And when an old friend of her father's approaches her with an unavoidable decision carrying terrifying implications Margot is caught between an "either" and an "or" that challenges everything she's tried to stand for and the people she loves most in the world.
