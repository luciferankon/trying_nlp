The project is a critique of the social media phenomenon. It aims to touch on the issues of isolation and narcissism but with a humerous tone. A man walking through the streets head down. Those he passes will have their faces severely distorted. He speaks to nobody. He makes eye contact with none. Arriving at a bus stop he sits on the bench and pulls out his cell phone. At this point a series of video social media avatars appear above him. Each is a "friend" in the world of social media but really acts as a reflection of himself. All the clips are avatar cliches. So there is the hipster the mirror poser the hillbilly the cool guy the shy guy etc. No words are heard though several of the avatars can be seen talking.
