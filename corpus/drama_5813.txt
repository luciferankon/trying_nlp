At the turn of the 21st century a series of top-secret privately funded experiments took place at an international space station. The experiments known as Operation Atom were an effort to split the atom and harness what is known as the "God Particle." The experiments were a success but in turn released an energy shock wave so powerful that it awoke a black hole which had been dormant for thousands of years. This black hole was the closest to Earth that science had ever discovered and had such a strong gravitational force that it realigned Earth's orbit. This left half the planet stuck in darkness while the other half remained directly underneath the sun causing a 7 year span of catastrophic activity on Earth. 75% of the all living things would die during this time period. This is where our story begins.
