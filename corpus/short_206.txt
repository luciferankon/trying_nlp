The artistes of the bid ball become leading dancers at the penalty mark. Slow motion animation modification or restriction of color further lend emphasis to the close interaction with the musical movements achieving a positive unity regardless weather attention is focussed on the goalkeeper on team play on vigorous tackling or on goalmouth excitement which are all synchronized in sequence form with the musical sections.
