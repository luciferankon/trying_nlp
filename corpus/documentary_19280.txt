Making Big Plans: The Story of Chicago's Olympic Dream encapsulates the city's four-year attempt to host sports' biggest event. While Chicago didn't attain its desired goal to host the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games the city and its people benefited immeasurably. The documentary offers never before seen behind-the-scenes footage and exclusive interviews of the Bid's leaders. Not so much a retrospective as a celebration of the effort "Making Big Plans" offers a look at the legacies left by Team 2016 and what the future might hold for another Chicago Bid.
