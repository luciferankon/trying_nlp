This short video is built around several short loops of home video that are cross-faded and run through various sound responsive luminosity keys and colorizers. A zone out film. A reflection on my son's growth. This is the fourth part of a series of yearly videos made with my son. This video was produced at the Experimental Video Center in Owego New York.
