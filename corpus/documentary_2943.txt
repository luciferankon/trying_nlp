California is a microcosm of a planet-wide quest for a nuclear-free and carbon-free energy future. The story behind the historic shutdown of the San Onofre nuclear generating station located in tsunami and earthquake zones between densely populated Los Angeles and San Diego is an instructive and empowering one for other 'reactor communities' around the country and the world. The end of the 'nuclear age' from an overdose of market and public opposition forces has begun (four U.S. shutdowns have been announced since June 2013). A movement for a nuclear free future is resurgent. But it has deep roots in the past.
