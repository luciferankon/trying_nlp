In America's Deep South the men of a small farming town live in fear of a mythical 7ft tall wood-cutter who lives in the woods. 'Big Ryker' terrifies the townsfolk but most of the local guys are pre-occupied with having hot sex in the open air. It is only when pretty but stupid farm-boy Christian Fox gets lost in the wood that he learns the truth about Ryker and his gigantic chopper!
