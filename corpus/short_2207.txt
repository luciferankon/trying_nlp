A girl finds herself lost in London unaware of her own identity; mysterious signs slowly emerge linking her to her hidden past. Ignored by her surroundings too afraid to attempt interpersonal engagement and left only with these signs she slowly wanders towards the truth of her existence. 1896 is a dark mythologized expression of how our inner thoughts in partnership with the universe guide us and enable us to discover who and what we are -- and where we belong.
