Pa doesn't mind a little dirt and disorder but ever since Ma died the Walkers have lived like pigs and Pa's tired of it. He decides his "young 'uns" need a new Ma so he goes calling on Daisy a widow from Butterfly Gap. Pa is afraid Daisy will refuse to mother such a filthy brood so Pa dresses the kids up like little darlings and tells Daisy the kids are just big for their ages. The trick is on Pa when Daisy plays the same game.
