FAT CAMP follows fitness buff Hutch Daily (Chris Redd) a foul-mouthed 27 year-old with the maturity of a pre-teen. After refusing to find employment or his own apartment his mom (Vivica A. Fox) gives him two choices: homelessness or work at his uncle's (Mel Rodriguez) fat camp. Though he thinks fatties are disgusting Hutch finds himself supervising an irreverent group of chunky boys who ultimately help him grow up.
