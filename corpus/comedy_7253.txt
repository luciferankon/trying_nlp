However begrudging the creditors so large a share in the money they come up with an elaborate scheme which involves faking the indebted Aubrey's death in favour of the next heir named in the will his cousin George Maitland. Unfortunately Maitland turns out to have a wife to claim him while their butler decides to get in on the act on his own behalf... not to mention the awkward fact that the real George is also on his way!
