This is the Story of the Making of Clarissa's World. Catch 22-Clarissa's World the Movie goes behind the scenes in front of the camera and to times when things happened when there was no camera in sight. This has been a long time in the making and we are not in Post-Production of this project. It features some amazingly talented young people. The gifted Actors who participated in this project did a wonderful job and brought to life the Characters that I created. Though there were many good times during the filming of this project there were also times that were not so good. Death Threats the main Character being attacked and more....off camera. - This project was slated for the original Ark Music Factory then it was slated for a couple of TV stations...now it is going to be a movie. - The Tag Line was and is: " Fame and glamour may be golden but they come with a price. What price will have to be paid and who will be willing to pay it." Watch for more Info on "CATCH 22-CLARISSA'S WORLD the Movie"
