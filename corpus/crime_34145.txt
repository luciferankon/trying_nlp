Woman who vanished 5 years after escaping probation on manslaughter charge turns up at her family's estate on the eve of her sister's wedding-to her ex husband (who divorced her in absentia) and is found strangled floating in a pond next morning. A former colleague of Magellan husband of woman killed 5 years earlier is assigned to the case. The groom to be is hospitalized and is the logical suspect-until he reveals seeing her rekindled his love and now has lost her again. Many subplots and red herrings.
