Palestinian testimonies collected after the second Intifada revealed a harsh daily life reality that for Israelis had always belonged to the "others" - the Palestinians - and hence was denied. A few years later trespassing what had been taboo until then Israeli officers who served during the Intifada told of their memories. Memories of violence of suffering of humiliation. The stories from both sides matched. Against the backdrop of local empty landscapes an Israeli officer remembers... a Palestinian civilian remembers as well. A journey into the collective memory of Palestine and Israel takes place.
