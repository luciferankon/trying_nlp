Life is series of mundane events. Excitement in our lives often comes as 'bad news'or arguments. FEETS! focuses on the small pleasures of life. It often appears as if 'something is going to happen' in the next frame but it doesn't. There is no plot development in FEETS! because each moment is the plot each moment is 'whats next'.
