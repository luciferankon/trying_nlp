When war correspondents move on to their next conflict a more personal struggle is just beginning for those left behind. Poverty PTSD and political corruption continue to stifle recovery nearly 20 years after the brutal civil war in Bosnia Herzegovina. Luckily for some in the small mountain town of Livno an unorthodox leader has emerged giving struggling veterans and their community an unlikely path to healing. A paramilitary leader at the young age of 20 Lija led the successful defense of his town while neighbors fell to the invading forces. Today he heads the Wolves a motorcycle club that resembles the stereotype in rough image only. Under his leadership this wild crew has become a positive force for good with a self-defined humanitarian focus. One mission captures their spirit more than any other. In the mountains where they once fought they now defend a herd of wild horses that society has similarly deemed expendable. A harsh environment poachers and urbanization continually threaten the herd. Stirred by their strength the Wolves are determined to control their own fate and finally emerge from the shadows of war.
