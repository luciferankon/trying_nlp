McAllister ('Ole Olsen (II)' (qv) and Hamilton ('Chic Johnson' (qv))are a couple of con-men who travel about the country selling worthless stock to small town citizens. THey come to Chesterville where they see a potential sucker list in the local war-veteran's home. They sell shares to the vets in a local worthless oil-field. McAllister falls in love with the widowed-owner of their hotel Louise Heath ('Lila Lee (I)' (qv))who persuades him to give up his shady dealings. But before he can convince his partner the townspeople catch on to their scheme and decide jail is the place for them. After being run out of town after town for trying to sell worthless stock two con artists breeze into the small town of Chesterville where they find themselves accused of kidnapping a young boy to whom they offered a ride. When that misunderstanding is cleared up the two conmen hatch a plot to unload all their worthless paper on the gullible citizens of Chesterville.
