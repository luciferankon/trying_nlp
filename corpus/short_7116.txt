A poli-com-dram - a political comedy with a lot of drama as well. This is the story of a 50-year-old white man who has decided to go back to school at an urban community college Isaac Delgado Community College - not just to go to school but to pursue an Associate's Degree in Television and Video Production as a precursor for film school where liberalism and political correctness may be even worse than on most college campuses. This short film teaser will highlight a couple of the many encounters that this returning student has had with some of his college professors instructors and fellow students. It all ends well with the student getting his Associates Degree but things may get even worse as the student prepares to move on to a traditional four-year college in New Orleans to complete his film school degree.
