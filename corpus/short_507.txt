Starting where _The Sid Saga Part 1 (1985)_ (qv) leaves off 'Sid Laverents' (qv) continues to tell his life story. It's now 1927 Sid is nineteen years old and is trying to make a career in vaudeville with his twenty-four year old girlfriend Sue in a novelty act which on his side is his one-man band. Although they would get married a year later they billed their act as a brother/sister one. They wanted to make it big in New York but hit the theaters there in their hometown of Jacksonville Florida and everywhere else in-between. They realized they had to travel to make a living since their act was a novelty one that would wear thin in one place. A natural disaster during one stint in Elba Alabama not only threatened to wipe out their act but to wipe them out literally. The advent of the talkies and the Great Depression would kibosh their vaudeville career. Taking odd jobs both on and off the stage over the next ten years would take its toll and lead in part to the end of the marriage. His single life would not last long as he quickly married a woman named Stella a waitress in a club where he was performing. That marriage would have its continual problems. The advent of WWII would lead to a military stint and being shipped overseas into the Pacific theater. However he got out of it a technical education in sheet metal work a 'round the world trip and knowledge of the fact that he had a genius IQ. Part two of his story ends with the end of the war with the story continuing in _The Sid Saga Part 3 (1989)_ (qv).
