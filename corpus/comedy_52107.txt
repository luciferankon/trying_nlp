A comedy entertainment series exploiting the delights of spoofing blagging and hoaxing. In each show presenters Patrick Stockhausen Lorna Watson and Guy de Beaujeu are given a mission: first to set up a hoax and then to persuade people that it's true. The first half of the programme follows them as they try to obtain information to carry out their mission; the second half shows their success or failure in completing it. The two series fooled millions into believing that a musical was being made about the life of John Major and that Henley was to host the British Lap-Dancing Championships.
