This film about contemporary life in Lisbon concerns an Irish woman Cathy who dearly loves her Portugese lawyer husband Pedro. Though unbeknownst to her he engages in one tryst after another. Cathy soon finds herself trying to help a young delinquent get off heroin while the youth's desperate mother joins a weird religious cult. In other segments an elderly man is nearly driven mad with grief at the loss of his granddaughter in a train station while a down-and-out jeweller ushers the young girl to a hotel room.
