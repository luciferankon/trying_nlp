Bulldog in the Whitehouse takes political satire to obscene new heights: portraying the Bush administration as a cabal of lustful and traitorous gay men who are too busy having sex to notice the empire crumbling down around them. An explosive and darkly comic adaptation of Choderlos de Laclos' novel Dangerous Liaisons the film's web of sex and deceit centers on Bulldog a hustler who seduces his way into the Washington press corps to gain access to the halls of the political elite. At the bidding of his puppet master a corpulent and power mad Karl Rove Bulldog engages in manipulative trysts with Whitehouse hotties like the demure press secretary the religious leader and the confused imbecilic good ol' boy president himself.
