A humorous brief look at the lives of a few men some of whom have grown prematurely old others of whom have yet to grow up. The characters are real they live among us. It's just that they no longer seem as enthusiastic about their favorite activity - soccer hooliganism - as they used to be. Beanpole ('Vladimír Dlouhý (I)' (qv)) a middle-aged loner finds himself in crisis one Sunday afternoon. His own fans threaten to assault him before a game. Beefy ('David Novotný (I)' (qv)) the unwritten leader of a sizable group of fans comes to his aid. Thanks to him Beanpole finds himself in new surroundings and he observes with detachment the group of aging soccer hooligans who have accepted him among them.
