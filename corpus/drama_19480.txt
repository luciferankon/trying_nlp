A meditative journey through the shifting landscape of emotion and the hypnotic quality of our desires. Set to music by Roma 79 and filmed entirely unscripted Bird in Hand is an exploration of a young man's struggle to let go of unfulfilled dreams to make way for life's possibilities. Stunning sequences from the streets of San Francisco to the lush greenery of Louisiana give way to artful portrayals from an ensemble cast.
