Glenn Towery (an African American) and Linus Michael Leting (An African from Kenya) two film students decide to attend the Million Man March called for by the honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan in 1995. They sign up in Los Angeles. Seek spiritual guidance then embark on an adventure to Washington DC to attend the Million Man March in search of the meaning of the event to themselves and other attendees. The year was 1995. A call went out. A desperate plea to Black men everywhere. It was a message that seemed to carry grave consequences if not answered. The call emanated from Minister Louis Farrakhan much maligned by the press for his comments as it regards the state of the Black man in America. The message was clear and unmistakable God had called for a Million Man March. It was as though the march itself would be all that could possibly stave off the very threat of real genocide young Black men seemed to be facing everyday. A million Black men were called to Washington DC on October 16th 1995. Their mission was to pray for strength and guidance from Our Father God and to publicly atone for their past transgressions and to pledge together to become better men in the future. Make no mistake it was an historic day as nearly two million men converged communed atoned and prayed together in Washington DC. Millions more who did not attend also celebrated prayed and atoned from home from around the world. It was under this backdrop that Glenn Towery (Los Angeles) & Linus Michael Leting (Kenya Africa) two film students decided to attend the Million Man March together and to document events leading up to that historic and biblical day in search of the true meaning of the "Million Man March".
