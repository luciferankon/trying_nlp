Walter Duts lives a quite existence in a rural Flemish neighborhood. Since the recent death of his mother he has to take care of himself and the house. He'd never hurt a fly although his strange and peculiar appearance (sporting a wild beard and two enormous looking glasses) might suggest otherwise. His peaceful life gets interrupted by a troubled relationship with the rest of the world who look at Walter nervously irritated and prejudiced. Yet Walter never becomes a victim of all that aggression. Eventually it always will be the 'others' who take the wrong direction. Walter is not the only one who is at peace with his life. He maintains a steady relationship with his neighbor Annie and the seventeen year old girl next door Mieke. Annie's daughter Conny also has sympathy for Walter but her husband Danny who is a police officer hates the 'eccentric' Walter. These are the main characters in the world of Duts an uncomplicated microcosm on which a hectic modern society with its rules and restrictions unsuccessfully tries to get a hold on.
