Katrin (Leena Hiltonen) - a young erotic and primitive teenager - spends her summertime at a little island in the Stockholm archipelago. She spends most of her time sitting up in a tree "peeping" at the islands inmates as they're having sex. Sometimes she climbs down her tree to participate in some of the really sleazy love acts.
