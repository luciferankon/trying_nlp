Ayane and Hayate are after Kasumi clones 'Alpha 152' and 'Phase 4'. In the meantime Kasumi is unaware of this. In the middle of this there's a "Dead or Alive tournament" going on so everyone fights some of characters and come across Alpha 152. Later Kasumi finds out that she has a clone of herself and she's on a search. Can Kasumi help her half-sister Ayane and her brother Hayate find the clone and put a stop to project Alpha? Who can Hayate and Ayane really trust?
