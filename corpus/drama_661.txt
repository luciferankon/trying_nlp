This drama centers on a love story between an Iranian-Palestinian Muslim man and a French Jewish woman. Over the course of the 22 episodes the hero saves his love from Nazi detention camps and Iranian diplomats in France forge passports for the woman and her family to sneak on to airplanes carrying Iranian Jews to their homeland. Based upon a true story of Abdol Hussein Sardari who worked at the Iranian embassy in Paris and apparently saved the lives of thousands of European Jews by forging Iranian passports for them.
