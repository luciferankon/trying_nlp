Fourteen-year-old Colm Bell and his 11-year-old sister Lydia wake to the smell of smoke and the sound of gunfire - raiders are attacking their home. They grab their backpacks - prepacked for such an emergency - and head to the tunnel and the hills following the escape route they have practised every day for their young lives. They don't look back. This is a futuristic movie set in Australia when the earth has been plundered and natural resources depleted. Society has broken down completely and small groups of people live in suspicion desperately hording their meagre supplies. Based on the best selling book by Joss Hedley
