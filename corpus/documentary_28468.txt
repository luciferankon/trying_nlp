Jos van Pinxteren has been a smuggler all his life. When he is caught in 1941 by the Nazi's for the illegal slaughter of a pig he ends up in the Ukraine. Now Jos has Alzheimer and Korsakoff disease. History literally fades makes way for a bare insight in Jos' character. At the same time we see Ukraine's more recent history: the accident with the Chernobyl Nuclear Power-plant where radiation-particles have disappeared but the radiation is not gone and people of an Ukrainian mountain-village. They do not talk about what has happened amidst them. Or does someone still know about Pieter Menten a well-known Dutch war-criminal?
