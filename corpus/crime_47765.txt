Few weeks have passed since the successful heist was pulled off by the three individuals (one of which is keeping the loot safe for the other two till the heat dies). When the other two turn up to collect their share the main protagonist claims he can't recall anything about the heist as he's suffering from first stage of dementia. Is he really suffering from memory loss or is it all an elaborate plan to keep the loot for himself.
