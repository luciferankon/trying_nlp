Why do we fight? Are we able to live past our experiences? 'Anamnesis' explores two boxers' traumatic childhood's as they fight each other in the ring. A curious dissection into the psychology of boxing as well as a metaphor for cognitive behavioural theory 'Anamnesis' asks unflinching questions about who why and how we are and explores how traumatic experiences shape us and motivate our actions in the present. Who will win this physical and cognitive battle? 'Anamnesis' represents the human conundrum-the impossible question- one we have to answer for ourselves.
