At the age of eighteen free-spirited and pregnant Kara Bradford ran away from home with her faithful sister Guin by her side. For the next ten years Guin found enjoyment in caring for both Kara and her son Dru. However when Dru was diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) everything started to change. Dru's disease rang as the wake-up call Kara never wanted to receive but felt forced to answer and she immediately assumed the role of Dru's primary caregiver. During the course of the film Kara slowly alienates Guin further and further from the family until Guin finds herself without a place within the family structure. Dru holds tight to his friendship with childhood buddy Brian Hand as he watches the beautiful person he once admired in his aunt Guin slowly fall apart before his eyes. In the end Dru can only hope that compassion honesty and perseverance will be enough to repair the bonds of family and remind the Bradford sisters of what it truly means to love.
