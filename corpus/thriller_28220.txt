Dhawan is the Principal of a science college in Bombay. He has a questionable past as his actions had led to the sudden suicide of a young woman who was the victim of a raging by senior students. As a result Dhawan is not thrilled when he gets reports that a group of students calling themselves the "mobile group" were involved in raging a new but brilliant student Alok. He punishes them but this results in the disfigurement and death of Alok. Not wanting to create another scandal and tarnish his record Dhawan informs the police that Alok's death was an accident. Folliowing this members from the mobile group start getting brutally killed one by one. Evidence gathered by Inspector Choudhry leads him to conclude that the killer could be Ravi Suman members of the Rampuri group or the Principal himself. Then Dhawan himself gets killed. Given the evidence he arrests the son of MLA Malhotra and holds him for trial. He also manages to get a confession. Then the next day three more of the mobile group members are killed - and no one is sure anymore who the killer actually is.
