Prior to the arrival of Professors Ori Kritz and Lea Reches Hebrew was taught under the Classics department by professors of History. Originally only two levels of biblical Hebrew existed at the University. The Judaic Studies program increased that to three levels of Modern Hebrew. In 2003 professor Ori Kritz arrived bringing with her the unique dedication needed to launch the study of the language into a full-fledged program. Together with Lea Reches and some very dedicated students the program expanded and continues to grow. The original students developed a companionship with their professor and a great love for the language and history surrounding it. This is their story.
