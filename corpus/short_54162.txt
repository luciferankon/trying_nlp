The story revolves around three women and a transvestite working in a beauty salon whose interaction with one another engenders facets of personality and suppressed desires in each one hitherto unknown to them. Four different episodes show how various women assert their suppressed desires through the emotional and physical masks forced upon them. Some episodes capture the subtle tensions of the disintegration of friendship between two women caused by their conflicting sexual preferences and the gloomy discrete life of a disabled eunuch drag queen. Other episodes rhythmically show women's confusion and frustration between desire and taboo fantasy and reality. Another episode shows a woman about to enter married life and another woman who has rejected the marital system.
