Save Our Male Voice Choirs follows the story of Blaenavon Male Voice Choirs as they look to adapt to the 21st Century and embrace social media in an attempt to rejuvenate their choir and engage with younger audiences. As the average age of the choir has risen the fear that their numbers may fall has also increased. With some members being in their 90's and only 2 choristers under the age of 30 - they realise that they need new blood if they are to not only continue their tradition but to remain competitive.
