Meet Malcolm (Alonzo Herran Jr.). Young Black and Living in America. Born into the rough streets of Newark NJ he had 3 strikes against him when he made his mark in the world. Growing up in the projects taught him at a young age how to be a survivor. And a survivor he was. Hustling was an art for Malcolm and a hustler he was. Getting money was his thing but with more money comes more problems. Roll with Malcolm and his crew Ibn (Usman Sharif) Mark (Hassan Oliver) LQ (Malik Barrett) and Fredro (Raheem Ali) as they show you valuable life lessons and how you can never play the game because the game always plays you.
