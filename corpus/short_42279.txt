GUN is the story of a gun. A gun that has the power to move from place to place on its own volition. The Gun gives a street punk the power to climb the ladder of criminality from shoplifter to killer; then it leads a frightened fisherman down the trail of thoughtless action. With each incident the gun grows stronger in power until ultimately in the final scene it pulls its' own trigger.
