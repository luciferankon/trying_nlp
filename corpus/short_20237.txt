Short film "If I Can Drive I Can Dive" directed by Slovenian author Peter Lombar is presenting a large group of SCI (Spinal Cord Injury) divers in a swimming pool during their practice. Divers are members of IAHD Adriatic (International Association for Handicapped Divers Adriatic) from Slovenia which is member of C.M.A.S. (Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques). The film has been rewarded with Prix Expression Libre at 37th Festival Mondial de l'image Sous-marine in Marseille and with Special Jury Award at 14th Belgrade International Underwater Film Festival. The rewards are payment for almost ten years of discovery work on a field of diving for people with disabilities which would not be possible without significant support from C.M.A.S.
