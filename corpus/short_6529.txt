Unbeknownst to Pee-Wee and crew the Playhouse is surrounded by a SWAT team. And just as Conki delivers the day's secret word- Justice -all hell breaks loose. When the smoke clears Pee-Wee finds himself under arrest- For manufacture and distribution of 'Yo'. Taken downtown and booked the facts of the case are slowly revealed to him- he's been set up by Playhouse mean guy Randy. Pee-Wee is abandoned by his big-time TV handlers. His public defendant recommends he cop a plea and take the 10 years but Pee-Wee innocent of the mechanics of drug law sentencing goes to trial where he faces a life sentence. Pee-Wee's defense is no match for Randy's lies-he's found guilty and sent to prison where he narrowly escapes the worst of horrors. Meanwhile on the outside Miss Yvonne Cowboy Curtis and the gang mount a campaign to free Pee-Wee. Presidential candidate Jesse Ventura is persuaded to make Pee-Wee's release a part of his platform and when later Jesse is elected president not only does he free Pee-Wee but all the non-violent 'Yo' offenders across the land. Back at the Playhouse Cowboy Curtis wrangles a face to face meeting with Randy and Pee-Wee. But Pee-Wee isn't bitter- He's proud to have played a part in the release of all the prisoners who didn't even have a campaign.
