Twelve ill and injured soldiers from the Canadian forces journey half way around the world to the Himalayas where in the shadow of the world's highest peak Mount Everest they are pushed to their limits as they attempt to climb the 20305 ft. giant known as Island Peak. Their mission is to raise awareness and funds for other battle-injured soldiers with the hope that the expedition will help heal their emotional mental and physical wounds.
