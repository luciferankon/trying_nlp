An Avon lady a mason who couldn't become a football player a helicopter pilot barely 60 years old a young mother... these are very diverse characters that have something in common: they suffer from Alzheimer's. This is the story of a Choir made up of people with Alzheimer's: from it's initial stages through difficult months of practice to the final performance at a huge auditorium. The documentary demonstrates the therapeutic objectives of forming the choir; to recover the identity and emotion that is ebbing away for the choir participants but that somehow survives attached in some way to musical memory and which can return again through music. It is a cross-media project which includes a 54' film as well as an web-documentary music videogames a YouTube channel and other applications. The non-linear version places the viewer at the heart of the story. The viewer can take control of what he sees at any given moment sieze the narrative route and change direction when appropriate. The personal stories of the characters are supported by multimedia resources such as interactive music therapy videogames and expert testimonies all of which facilitate the immersion into the story and and the understanding of it - The project is open to participation and content amplification via social networks.
