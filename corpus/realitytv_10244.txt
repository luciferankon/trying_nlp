There's a general obsession nowadays with what pop culture was like in the past few decades. New TV show "REBOBINA" ("Rewind") combines this worldwide phenomenon with the unbeatable Brazilian knack for debating the highs and lows of their national pop culture - and even international stuff that washed up on those shores. The series is presented by DJ Zé Pedro known for his remixes of Brazilian pop music classics. In each episode comedians musicians actors and celebrities in general dig into the highlights - and lowest points! - of pop culture in the recent past. Among its first guests "REBOBINA" has Betty Lago Fafá de Belém Preta Gil Ana Carolina Marcius Mellem e Letícia Spiller.
