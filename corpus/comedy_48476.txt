Johnny's the new kid in town -- and if that's not bad enough -- he's caught in the middle of a vicious gang war between 'The Rats' and 'The Ponies.' But when he hits it off with a gang leader's old flame things really take a turn for the worse. In this town being the new guy is tough. Being in love is a battlefield. A Rock and Roll Action Comedy from Philadelphia's Catch-22.
