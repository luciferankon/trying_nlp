I Am Hunger is currently in production. The film is an insight into UK Food Poverty and features the amazing and vital work some of the self-funded self-financed charities carry out on a daily basis caring for and feeding the most vulnerable in society.

The work these charities carry out is a lifeline to some folk in our society. Written and Directed by Anthony Tombling Jr for Unit 3 Films the film is due for completion Spring / Summer 2017.
