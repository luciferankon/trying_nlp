Sobering tale about the small-time loser Santiago who roams the streets of a Spanish town after leaving his wife and children looking for ground under his feet. There only seems to be one way out for him. Surprising Dardennesque debut by producer Serrano. Somewhere in a Spanish city Santiago (in his 30s and played by the Mexican painter Bosco Sodi) roams aimlessly and lonely through the streets. His wife has thrown him out and the judge has decided that he cannot see his children for now. Santiago tries to put his life back together again from this unfortunate situation. He has a job in a friend's bar but is given the sack. Little by little his life falls apart. The camera (impressive work by David Valdeperez) follows him roaming the streets looking for work and for an aim in life. His only way out seems to be the highest bridge in the city... Scriptwriter and novice director Carlos Serrano Azcona (1969) previously worked on "Japon" by Carlos Reygadas who is co-producer this time as is the Spaniard Jaime Rosales director of e.g. "Bullet in the Head". The form and style of "The Tree" were partly inspired by the work of the Dardenne Brothers but Serrano Azcona was also influenced by the possibilities of modern video cameras as previously revealed by Albert Serra ("Honour of the Knights") and Rafa Cortes ("Yo"). The result is a dynamic yet restrained and contemplative film. The Tree opens the eyes of the viewer to everyday despair and existential hope culminating in a climax that has to be seen to be 'believed'. (ID/GT)
