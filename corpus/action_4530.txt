A priest was killed. The finger of suspicion pointed at Miguel who had been asked by the church to vacate the land where a chapel was going to be built. The only one who could save Miguel was the old man Mang Domeng. It was not likely though. Miguel wanted to marry his daughter Estrella but Mang Domeng believed that she was destined for a rich and powerful man. He would be very happy to see Miguel put away.
