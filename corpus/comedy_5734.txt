In this shot-for-shot spoof remake of Brando's The Last Tango in Paris American in fictional city of Burbank France called Paul is grieving over the suicide of his drag queen wife who may or may not have actually been his gay lover. Paul meets beautiful Frenchwoman named Maria (in-joke reference to Maria Schneider the female star of The Last Tango in Paris) and pretends to be a god's gift to women in an attempt to seduce her. However she proves to be much less impressed with him than Schneider was with Brando a fact that even Paul points out in a throwaway meta-jokey line. There were two versions of this sex comedy one with and one without the hardcore insert shots. The movie is considered lost and both director Charles Band and editor-turned-director John Carpenter disassociated themselves from it.
