USA vs AL-ARIAN is a close portrait of an Arab-American family facing terrorism charges leveled by the U.S. Government. The film shows a personal story of a family living in a society where fear of terrorism has resulted in increasing stigmatization and discrimination against Muslims. "USA vs AL-ARIAN" is an intimate family portrait that documents the American-Muslim family Al-Arian's desperate attempt to fight terrorism charges leveled by the US Government. In February 2003 university professor and pro-Palestinian civil rights activist Sami Al-Arian was arrested in Tampa Florida charged with providing material support to a terror organization. For two-and-a-half years he was held in solitary confinement denied basic privileges and given limited access to his attorneys. While the Bush administration considered this a landmark case in its campaign against international terrorism Sami Al-Arian claims he was targeted in an attempt to silence his political views.
