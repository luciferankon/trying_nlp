A woman falls in love with a married Belgian man. She finds out that he's married too late... although it's the second thing he says. The rest of the film is about the struggle of the man between his two loves and of the woman not able to finish the hopeless and dangerous relationship. The title "tot ziens" (au revoir a farewell greeting that implicates that one will see eachother again) is the ironic description of the film which is about going away for good and then coming back again because something is always stronger than your ratio.
