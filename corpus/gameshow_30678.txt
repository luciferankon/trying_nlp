Anybody can have a great idea for a Film TV or VR project but very few have the connections to get those ideas made. The Pitch Elevator is here to change that. In October of 2016 Legion M built a full-size elevator set on the floor of Stan Lee's Los Angeles Comic Con. Guests were invited to step inside and give a 2 minute pitch for their film TV or VR idea. After collecting over 200 pitches at the show (and other 200 during an online submission period) we've turned to our Legion to rate and review these projects. Over multiple rounds of competition we're narrowing the field down to the top 10 finalists who will receive a chance to pitch their idea LIVE to a panel of Hollywood insiders and win prize packages that could include a development deal with Legion M. Legion M is using the Pitch Elevator as the basis for a next generation unscripted TV or Web Series.
