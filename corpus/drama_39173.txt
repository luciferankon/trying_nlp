During the time of the anti-fascist resistance in Bulgaria a wounded partisan Velkov swims across the border into Turkey when he finds refuge with the poor peasant Dzhelal. Eight years later Velkov returns to these parts as a captain commanding the border post. A low-flying aircraft strafes the village. The border troops shoot it down but a young boy Toshko has been wounded. A cooperative farm is being created in the village. Vasil tries to persuade Tosko's father to stay out but the honest man tells Velkov. Vasil and two other saboteurs cut off the electricity supply; kill the guard and set fire to farming machines. The bandits are apprehended. An incident on the border with Turkey is intended to divert attention from planned foray from the Greek side of the border. The Turkish officer forces Dzhelal to appear before the International Commission convened by Turkish side and accuse The Bulgarians of having started the trouble. Captain Velkov provides that he incident was deliberately instigated. Dzhelal decides to risk telling the truth.
