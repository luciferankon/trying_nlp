Life is hard when you're young dumb and hungry...poolside in Palm Springs California. Somewhere In Palm Springs is the harrowing tale of 4 friends forced to wait a normal amount of time for their lunch to arrive to their lounge chairs - they share hopes dreams neuroses and the sordid details of their various one night stands. They may be vapid but hey at least they're vapid.
