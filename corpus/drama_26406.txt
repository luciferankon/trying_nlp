After his mother died 12 year old Seth goes to live with his grandparents on their farm. Grouchy old Murdock is not very happy with the presence of his grandson and is rather hard on him. He was strongly opposed to the mixed marriage of his daughter and doesn't want to hear anything about Seth's Indian father who died a hero in Vietnam when Seth was still a baby. His grandmother on the other hand was very fond of Seth but after a while she passes away. So Seth and his grandfather are on their own now...
