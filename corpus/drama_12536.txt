After her husband dies Ella and her two children Lena and Fletcher must move from their plush life in Malibu to the family farm of a somewhat distant relative Vincent. Ella tries to make the best of it for her kids but they all struggle with their new environment and the loss of their Dad. Ella's growing fear of the hereditary effects of suicide causes new problems. The Uniform Motion of Folly refers to the inability of some people to deviate from a course they have so much invested in even if that course is not in their best interest. On the surface the story appears to be about the reversal of the family's fortunes when the father dies but beneath the coping with a move from the privilege of Malibu to the hard-scrabble farm in Northern California there lurks the question of suicide. In particular the mother is gripped by the fear of the hereditary effects of suicide. She wants to protect her teenage daughter from the disappointment inherent in chasing her dream of being an actor. Their relationship is further eroded by the mom's inability to discuss the even the possibility of the father's suicide. Add the friction with her late husband's brother and concern about her young son and you have a woman desperately trying to hold things together.
