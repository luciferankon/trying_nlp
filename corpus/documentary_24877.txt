World Yoga Champion Esak Garcia and his guru Bikram Choudhury want yoga accepted into the Olympics. Bikram the 'Bad Boy of Yoga' has also copyrighted his yoga style demanding teachers play by his rules or stop teaching. Now yoga chains ('McYoga'?) are popping up everywhere putting smaller studios out of business. Can yoga survive with its good karma intact? Yoga has known to exist since at least 1400 BC with its ultimate goal for each follower to reach self-awareness to the point of liberation. However yoga in the late 20th and early 21st centuries especially in the United States has transformed itself into something entirely different. For some it's become a panacea for all one's ills. For others it has become solely a physical pursuit and not a spiritual one. Regardless the popularity of yoga has led it to become big business which some see as being counter-intuitive to yoga's core beliefs. Many see Yogi 'Bikram Choudhury' (qv) as leading this new wave. For good or bad Bikram the founder of Bikram Yoga has copyrighted his style of yoga and is holding yoga competitions with the hopes of it getting into the Olympic movement. With the former issue some question his right to copyright something they see as having been public domain for centuries. Many call what Bikram does - standardizing the experience of yoga from one yogi to the next - as McYoga. Because of these transformations to what is called yoga some are calling for a code of morals and ethics to be struck to oversee the practice of yoga.
