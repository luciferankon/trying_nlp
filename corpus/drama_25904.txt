Lovers with a promise. Coleagues with nothing in common. In-laws with a deep secret. Parents facing death for the first time. Friends without a past. Sons of the wrong person. Brothers not really related. The most intimate stories may take place in public in a day. A summer afternoon in the park will be peaceful only if you don't meet the right person.
