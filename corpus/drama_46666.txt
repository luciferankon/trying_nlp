Two brothers return to Pinamar off-season to scatter the ashes of their mother and sell the family apartment. There they are received by Laura a beautiful young local who was Miguel's childhood friend. Among music drinks and games she awakens the desire of the brothers and turns what seemed like a trip that revolves around death into an adventure that connects them to the memory of those summers. A story as melancholy as it is luminous that builds itself almost imperceptibly and in which feelings aren't transmitted rapidly-it may take the entire running-time for that latent chemistry to manifest itself. Pinamar expresses itself exclusively in cinematic terms and gives a feeling of pleasure that floats around the story from the first minute and is worthy of cherishing as one of the great moments in film.
