In 1994 a deadly virus struck in suburban Brisbane killing a horse trainer and fourteen of his horses. The outbreak bamboozled everyone and there was a scramble to uncover the cause. Initially thought to be foul play in the racing scene rumors and accusations were rampant. In a dark room at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong scientists looked at the image in front of them and knew it was dangerous. Outbreaks of Hendra are recurring and although the disease is slow to move it is lethal. The next big virus is around the corner it might be just as lethal but able to move faster; a devastating combination. The Hendra story has told us we need to be ready.
