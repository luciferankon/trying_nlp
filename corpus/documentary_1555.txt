Autistic-Like: Graham's Story is an intimate family portrait showing one dad's determined quest to find the right therapies the right doctors and even the right words to describe his son. This short subject documentary is a startling report from the edge of the autism epidemic and illuminates the medical social and public health issues faced by families whose autistic-like children have no clear diagnosis and are offered no specific treatment.
