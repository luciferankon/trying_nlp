A boring Monday turns to terror when a pretty secretary is abducted by an assailant and then securely gagged and bound. In the next story two roommates are captured trussed and muzzled by a hired killer so they won't interfere with his plans to kill a man living in their apartment building. In the third story a wealthy young woman is kidnapped by a nasty villain and can only hope the ransom will be paid quickly so she can be released from the tight ropes and tighter gag that restrain her.
