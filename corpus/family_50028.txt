NBC Saturday morning TV show. Fast paced combining animations and live action much like a "Laugh-In" for kids. Lots of splashy graphics quick jokes with some educational elements too. Some of the "Laugh-In" cast were regulars as well. "Hot Dog" was a series about "stuff". Each week the program showed where four or five common everyday items come from and answered kids' questions about them - "Is that really lead in a lead pencil?" "how do they make baseballs?" "What makes popcorn pop?" "Who invented the hot dog?". etc. The "hosts" - Woody Allen Jonathan Winters and JoAnne Worley would attempt to answer these questions in their own comedic way and then through imaginative cinematography editing and music the actual answer was shown. Winters portrayed many of his characters as "experts" Worley worked hard to give correct answers and Woody Allen (who's only TV series this is) gave bizarre responses as expected.
