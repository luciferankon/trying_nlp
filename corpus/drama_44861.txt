Thought provoking shades of humanity instead of punchlines are the main focus in this new short form scripted series ALONG FOR THE RIDE that re-enacts the edgy funny interesting life lesson conversations between driver Roberta (Rubie) and the 'passengers' who climb into her car. Rubie loves people and driving so to supplement her income she takes a job with one of the new ride share platforms. With medium length reddish-brown hair and a radiant smile at 56 she looks more like 48 courtesy of Youtube workout videos nightly glasses of red wine (with dinner) and a quarterly injection of Botox. Her slightly quirky but positive nature is evident in both her demeanor and the daily affirmations that she is known to quote. When in driver mode she makes it clear to her 'passengers' that her car is a "no judgment zone". The reverse of the old adage 'seen but not heard' is in play as Rubie places the focal point of each episode on her 'passenger' not herself. The stories and conversations she is privy to cover moral ethical and cultural lifestyles and attitudes. Outwardly Rubie's humor and compassion is truly genuine but it is her own thoughts and opinions (heard as voice over) that add depth and reflection not just towards her 'passengers' but towards herself as she too comes along for the ride.
