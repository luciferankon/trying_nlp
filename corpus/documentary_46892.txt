In a delicate border between 'fiction' and 'reality' the surprising character of "UnheardÂ­-of" Lanny Gordin projects himself between China his birthplace and Brazil where he lives and developed his career as a guitar player since the Tropicalia movement. We are invited to share his world where the border between 'unreason' and 'sanity' acquires new shades. The urban landscapes of Shanghai and Sao Paulo laden with symbols of a decadent and contradictory modernity are the landscape for us to get closer to his reflections. Lanny presents us another perspective free from recurring social and cultural patterns. With Lanny Gordin we can travel through the archetypes of contemporary society and we are led to reflect about them. Delicate polilinguistic meetings are experienced throughout the film while we can establish a connection with this entrancing character and to notice how his 'unreason' is a power for possibilities of new forms of unheard-of.
