The Scottish band Mogwai performs an incandescent show in front of a stunned crowd. As if time stood still the audience is transported along by musical waves both poetic and violent. 'Burning' dives into this wild sensual flow. Directors Vincent Moon and NathanaÃ«l Le Scouarnec guide us into a dream where there is no tomorrow. This is a black and white experience of the senses carved by the raw emotion of this pioneering band that doesn't need any words to touch the heart of its listeners. Layered and innovative the movie has its finger firmly on their pulse a sonic adventure between hope and rebellion. A lifetime of feelings in just one night.
