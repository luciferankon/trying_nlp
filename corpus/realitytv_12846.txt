Krista Simmons is a young food reporter that's always on the move. Her career has her out interviewing celeb chefs and traveling the globe searching for the best eats around which means its increasingly important to find balance in her daily diet. Every time someone asks her what she does for a living people ask how she's not one giant walking blob of bacon. She has practiced yoga for 10 years swam at NCAA levels and is currently training for her first triathlon. So when she's at home it's important that she creates healthful nutritious meals that give her energy but don't neglect her culinary prowess and worldly tastes. In this fresh new show she'll cover everything from juice cleanses to Meatless Mondays and transforming international street food into approachable healthful meals for active eaters with busy lives. Think of a young fit Rachel Ray or Daphne Oz with the culinary savvy of the "Hungry Girl." Each episode will cover a specific ingredient: how to make almond milk and use the pulp to make almond flour; how to open a coconut and what to do with the water; gluten-free flour alternatives; one pot-paleo meals etc.
