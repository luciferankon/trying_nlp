This is the story about Hagir Elsheikh a woman originally from the Sudan now living in the United States who took life's blows from those who were supposed to protect her and love her overcame it and continued to fight for others. She is a prime example of why you should live life and not allow it to live you. As well as we should not allow negative forces to dictate who we are who we are to become.
