After the events of Half Life 2 the Earth sent out it's collective police forces to amalgamate into one solid Space Corp. A Trigger happy mercenary with the handle; 'Reptile' is hellbent on getting revenge on the Corps for sending him off for holding a gun to the General's Head. At this time 3 idiots are fired off coincidentally to the same Planet. In their frayed attempt to get back they stumble upon and ruin Reptile's plans. So he now sees them as an obstacle and an enemy. It's up to 3 misfits; Doyle Vex and Gall to save the universe.. I guess.
