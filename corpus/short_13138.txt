Every mother feels stretched by the challenges of raising children. At one moment you are overwhelmed by the love you have for them and the next they are driving you insane. This film is a collaboration of three women artists -a dancer a writer and a filmmaker-each of whom knows intimately the joys and frustrations of nurturing kids. Performed by a lone woman on a dark stage the dance begins at pregnancy and reveals the often humorous situations we face trying to maintain some sense of equilibrium as the baby grows to child then adolescent and ultimately adult. Accompanied by the avant garde string quartet ETHEL and featuring the work of award-winning cinematographer Andrew Young the film is a moving dance and spoken word performance about one of life's most essential roles.
