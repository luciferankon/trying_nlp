The first of six episides looking at aspects of vanishing Britain. Terence Carroll visited Norfolk to travel on the doomed railway from King's Lynn to Dereham just before it closed. This was a line which Doctor Beeching omitted from his cull of branch lines but British Rail closed it anyway. Carroll found a mix of views amongst the many passengers on the train - some sad to see the line go and others who would "get the bus instead". The 28 miles of line closed in September 1968.
