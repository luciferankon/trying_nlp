Is there a real Shangri-La? American explorers Ted Vaill and Peter Klika researched the 1933 James Hilton book "Lost Horizon" and the 1937 Frank Capra film by the same name and uncovered clues as to Shangri-La's actual location deep in the mountains of Eastern Tibet. They located the source material Hilton used in writing the book and then journeyed to Tibet with a camera crew to present to the world this beautiful serene place and its remarkable people who have lived here mining gold since the days of Kublai Khan 800 years ago.
