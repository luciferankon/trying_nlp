Recently released home movies shot by the controversial Edward VIII reveal the untold story of his extravagant safaris with the real life cast of "Out of Africa" in the late 1920s complete with adultery champagne and specially built airstrips. At the height of the Great White Hunter era Edward turned his back on big game hunting and championed conservation instead. Inspired by his safari guide Denys Finch-Hatton - played by Robert Redford in the Oscar winning film - he put down his rifle and picked up a movie camera pioneering the photographic safaris we all know today. This is an enchanting real-life Out of Africa. There is great footage of 1920s hunting parties in east Africa - all pith helmets and charging elephants in juddery black and white. But there is also a terrific story about how the future Edward VIII went on safari and had the time of his life before coming to realise that the scale of casual slaughter was out of hand. One infamous American hunting party killed 11000 animals. The prince soon made himself a figurehead in conservation efforts and became a pioneering wildlife cameraman: the shot where he is charged by an angry rhino is extraordinary. Newly released footage filmed in 1928 and 1930 by Edward VIII himself shows the much-maligned monarch in a new light revealing the untold story of his safaris in Africa and his role in changing the future of the continent's wildlife. He was shocked by the scale of the slaughter he encountered with elephants rhinos lions and leopards being killed in their thousands and led a conservation campaign to protect the lives of these animals.
