A Maori man lies vegetative on life-support; his grief-stricken pakeha wife prohibits his blood family from entering their hospital room. A young girl hates her strict Chinese parents preferring the company of an old woman's rotting corpse or running about Auckland city jacking cars and robbing stores with an older Tokolau boy. A young heroin addicts heavily pregnant girlfriend goes into labor and a little girl is born in the room next to the dying man. The plot may be disorganized but is connected profoundly by the romantic message that with effort and hope we can overcome our grief at loss and by accepting responsibility we can balance the forces of sadness and exhilaration.
