This is the most remarkable record of a supernatural event I have ever witnessed.  - Wayne Darwen Director. On January 3rd 2001 documentary writer/producer Wayne Darwen brought a professional TV news crew into the Temple of the O. T. A. to visually record a remarkable event: the summoning of the ancient spirit Vassago. On February 1st the Los Angeles affiliate of a National TV Network broadcast an edited version of Vassago's Prophecy confirming that the Spirit had predicted a major news event. Only 13 days after the ritual was visually recorded President Laurent Kabila of the Congo was assassinated! In this video version we show you the entire operation in sequence exactly as it happened with no rehearsals and no retakes. Wayne Darwen also interviews the Magister Thabion (Poke Runyon) and the mystic seer Frater Solomon. Their unrehearsed answers to his probing questions leave no doubt as to the philosophical depth and spiritual power of Solomon's ancient Magick even in this modern age. In "The Magick of Solomon" video we dramatically reenacted magical rituals for instructive purposes whereas "Dark Mirror of Magick" is the record of an actual magical operation of historical significance. We believe that this remarkable documentary will be studied and commented on for years to come. This 2011 edition has ten more minutes of new footage added with commentary on the Vassago Prophecy as subsequently revealed in the following two years plus a new prophecy from Vassago himself. Viewer discretion is advised do not engage in these practices without the supervision of an experienced adept. CAUTION; This DVD shows actual Spirit Summoning not recommended for immature viewers
