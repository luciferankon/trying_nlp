Kasey is down on his luck. He has a crappy daytime job (with an evil boss who's ready to fire him) and a creepy annoying landlord who is knocking at the door if the rent is one day late. He has no family or friends except an obnoxious overbearing female (Beth) who always seems to show up at the wrong time (is it love?). To make ends meet Kasey does "incall" massage from his apartment. Unfortunately some of his married middle-aged male clients are more interested in things OTHER than massage. Enter Marco a sexy drifter in the country under mysterious circumstances. After the accidental death of one of his massage clients (that looks like a murder) and through a bizarre set of circumstances Kasey enlists the help of Marco to dispose of the body. What started as an accident soon becomes intentional as the duo lure unsuspecting men to their deaths. Its a race against time to get enough cash together to leave the country before they're caught by the police the landlord or the obnoxious Beth! How will this sex charged thriller end? Wouldn't you like to know?
