Journalist Moritz Nestler is working on an article about the neat madness and the way it's danger is played down by the politicians. A bullock's head which is infected with the disease is played into his hands and makes him realize that Germany is now affected by BSE too. In unofficial interviews with scientists he learns that BSE possibly could infect humans too - but before he can publish anything he's found dead. His girlfriend and colleague Ute Boehning doesn't believe in an accident and wants to continue his investigation - although her father who owns a slaughter-house asks her not to.
