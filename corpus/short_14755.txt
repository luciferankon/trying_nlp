This is an advertisement for the boutique travel agency RASK Travel. The aesthetic of the video was to play with ubiquitous stress sounds and juxtapose them with a time-lapse of floral rebirth. The advertisement aims for a universal message about hard working professionals who travel as a way to blossom again or become reborn.
