Philosophical parable "Eastern Corridor" was created during the decline of the "thaw" when Soviet artists were though metered and censored but still "a breath of freedom." As the film industry (as indeed and other production) in 1960s is entirely owned by the state the question of commercial profit from the rental of films although on the agenda but was not completely dominant. There was a so-called state orders on important topics of state ideology such as a revolutionary military historical biographical etc. It is logical that within the framework of military subjects were allowed not only action-picture type of spy ware detective but also films that were not originally designed for a mass audience but significant for the annual "plan." Thus there is no doubt that the "Eastern Corridor" was in the thematic focus of the studio "Belarus-film" based on usual partisan drum section telling about the heroism of Soviet people during the occupation. Eventually the film was not the way it was waiting to see the boss and was greeted with hostility not only to party officials but quite liberal critics. So it is only surprising that after spending two years on the shelf the film "Eastern Corridor" still left in the so-called "limited release" in 1968 ... This film could be the hit for any Western Festival of the late 1960s (as much a triumph as "The Cranes Are Flying" and "Ivan's Childhood.") but alas ... After the "Eastern Corridor" creative life of Valentin Vinogradov obviously did not work. Outstanding directorial talent is not given to open and he was forced to go to the "ordinary cinema"...
