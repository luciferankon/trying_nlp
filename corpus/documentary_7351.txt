Adolfo Perez Esquivel: RIVERS OF HOPE is the story of Latin America over the past eighty years as seen through the eyes of one man -- world famous artist human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo Perez Esquivel.

With extensive archival footage family photos and never before seen interviews this very personal film captures one man's journey upon the currents of hope that are now running across the Latin American continent and it chronicles the genuine progress being made in the struggle for human rights and social justice for all.
