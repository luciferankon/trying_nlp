The title is a direct play on Rene Magritte's 1928-29 series aptly known as "The Treachery of Images." Coincidentally that series was created at a time when most were beginning to suffer the effects of the Great Depression. Originally filmed as part of a project called '140' Kotek attempts to capture his environment in 140 seconds (a construct held in reference to Twitter's 140 characters) using both old media and new media and to film the results side by side using the appropriate slide show "technology."
