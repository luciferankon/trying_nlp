A series comprised entirely of short (several per episode) comedy sketches. Recurring bits included "Kentucky Boys" a pair of stereotypical hicks discussing life; "Ivan Tellalie" Soviet newscaster (and Hero of Soviet Union 23rd Class) and animated sequences involving the turkey that created TV. The show also included clips from Monty Python and other classic comedy.
