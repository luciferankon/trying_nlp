A documentary about the deconstruction of the Berlin Wall which makes no use of vocal commentary but instead focuses on visual elements. From the Potsdamer Platz to the Brandenburg Gate the camera captures the historic events from all sides and different angles: on the one hand there are news reporters and tourists from all over the world taking pictures children selling pieces of the wall to passers-by and people celebrating New Year's Eve on the other we see abandoned subway stations and officials with blank looks on their faces.
