The advertising slogans of Jimmy Hanagan and the lab reports reveal that the patented prepared pudding invented by Lemuel P. Twine has a treasure of Vitamin Z and is full of Zumph. Lemuel's daughter Helen is in love with Jimmy but her mother wants her to marry Lester Cadwalader Jr. son of Cadwalader Sr. political boss of the city and mentor and whip of the present mayor Moe Carson. Cadwalader is backing Twine for mayor even though he knows he can't win as he wants to keep a stronger candidate out of the running. But after the discovery of Zumph in Twine's pudding Cadwalader realizes that Twine will win the election. He has Twine's pudding branded as a fake and Twine as a fraud. But Lemuel comes from a long line of fighting Twines and as he dozes his ancestors appear before him telling him to fight to the end.
