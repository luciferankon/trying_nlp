A woman exits dreams and enters a world in crisis. Shrouded by drapes and surrounded by the sound of mysterious voices in strange concert with a raging storm she slowly realizes she is not alone. Beyond her curtain a man both distraught and desperate forces her into a dialogue illuminating their individual horror and the violence at the root of the unspoken. Maggie Gale wakes up in a ward unaware of her surroundings unaware of that she's pregnant. Looking down discovering the bump that she acutely remembers not having she panics. As the agitation subsides all she can think of is escape but the fear of what lays beyond the four fabric walls surrounding holds her captive. Outside a violent storm rages on. She tries her hand at manipulation but the nurses and warders won't have it she tries singing but is silenced by a neighboring patient's whistling finally she overcomes her fear enough to stick her head out of the drapes but is startled by a face a face she'll come to know as Carroll. Shortly after he'll ask her when she thinks the doctor is coming he will ask her that throughout the night and he will not find out the answer to that question. Carroll is an out of work sailor who owns a deck of cards and thinks he's a bit of a poker player. Maggie is better and he loses hand after hand. They get to talking he has a panic attack she has nightmares the ward is struck by lightning they make fun of the nurses and Carroll wants a smoke. He tells anecdotes spinning yarn after yarn and she doesn't believe him finding him increasingly annoying. This culminates when he pressures her to tell him why she's there. When she breaks she wants nothing other than to break him to. Then comes her admission an admission she didn't even want to admit to herself the reason to why she's there at all.
