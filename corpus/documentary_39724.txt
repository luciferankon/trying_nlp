The Final Solution is a 2003 documentary directed by Rakesh Sharma about the 2002 communal Gujarat Riots that arose as a response to the Godhra Train Burning incident on February 27 2002 where 58 Hindus were burnt alive on a train carriage. An official estimate states that 254 Hindus and 790 Muslims were killed during the riots with 223 more missing. The documentary consists mostly of interviews with both Muslims and Hindus of multiple generations and both sexes with different views regarding the causes justifications and the actual events of the violence that occurred as well as their prospects for the future. The government of Gujurat at the time led by Chief Minister Narendra Modi was highly criticised throughout the documentary and was accused of inciting much of the rioting and not doing enough to halt it.
