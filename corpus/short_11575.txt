What seems to be a set of ancient armor is seen hanging on the wall when suddenly it takes the form of a living knight who hops to the floor and with one pass of his sword is transformed into a lady in medieval costume. She now begins to execute a series of magic tricks the first of which consists of the sudden bursting of a wheel of girls and swords on the blank wall background. These girls form many pretty tableaux after which they come to ground and disappear again. The lady magician now places a board across on two pedestals and with passes from her sword causes eight miniature girls in armor to appear on the board and go through a little military maneuver after which they too disappear. The manipulator now places her sword on the ground in several places; on each spot touched another sword springs up and then apparently she takes living girls' heads which fit on the handle of each sword. This done they too disappear. Another lady now comes on the scene and both carry a huge shield toward the spectators for close inspection the design on which is seen to consist of a living clown's head which makes comical grimaces. They take the shield back again and it disappears after which the girls too vanish in a burst of fire.
