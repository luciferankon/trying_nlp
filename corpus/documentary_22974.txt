The media's portrayal of Guadeloupe is alarming and seems to be summed up in few words: delinquency violence unemployment prostitution and addiction. This is not without consequences because in 2013 Guadeloupe held the sad title of the deadliest French department. 40 intentional homicides were committed in 2013. To deal with this issue the government policies have too often brought security solutions without necessarily wondering about the causes of this growing delinquency. What are they? What is the daily life of Guadeloupeans? Those are the questions that Karukera will set out to answer by showing a much more complex reality than the one showed by the media. This movie is a journey that will make you discover Guadeloupe from the so-called sensitive neighbourhoods to the most remote places of the island by giving the voice to those who are directly and indirectly affected by the social and economic crisis in that territory. This movie is above all a wake-up call and a way to be concerned about Guadeloupeans from another perspective.
