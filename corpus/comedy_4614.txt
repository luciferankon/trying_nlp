Roberto Condoro and Papitas are three childhood best friends separated by time and brought back together by the dying wish of Papitas the developmentally disabled wheelchair bound heir to a multi-million dollar fortune. His wish to have his friend's help him fulfill his bucket list a list that includes seeing a leprechaun and traveling through time. So Roberto and Condoro set out to create elaborate stings to trick their less than intelligent friend into believing he is actually living his dream. All too quickly they discover that this is going to be far more complicated than they thought when Papitas decides that seeing a leprechaun isn't enough and decides he is going to bring him home as his very own pet. A fact which is only less appealing to the dwarf actor hired to play the leprechaun than to the friends themselves. As the plans fall apart around them the friends are forced to improvise so not to expose the truth. A task all too complicated for the Best Worst Friends.
