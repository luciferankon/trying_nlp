A couple of out of work songwriters try to persuade a wealthy stockbroker to back them. But he turns out to be broke as they are. A series of mistaken identities misunderstandings and general confusion as our heroes attempt to make a living as songwriters in 1930s Britain. Well paced acting with some quite amusing lines together with some reasonably good song and dance make this amusing Ealing Studio production worth a viewing.
