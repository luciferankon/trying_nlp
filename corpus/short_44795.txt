I am a classical photographer but a novice in the video world. It is not the newness of technology that fascinated me (I have a headful of gray hair) but rather the opportunity to express my sense of reality by looking beyond the traditional photograph. My current work is focused on Coney Island a real place which has a particularly surreal quality to it. Bubbles By The Sea is the first work of the series. In it I explored elements of multiple genres by placing a performer within a documentary setting.
