Hayat was born in Mogadishu (Somalia) in 1989 but had to flee from the country before she was even two years old to avoid the armed conflict that is still going on today. More than 20 years later Hayat prepares herself to travel to a northern region of ancient Somalia of which her mother had always told her family stories: Somaliland. Although it is not recognized throughout the international community as a sovereign country Somaliland declared independence from the rest of Somalia in 1991 at the beginning of the war. From then on it has resurged from the ashes to construct a state with its own political institutions a democratically elected president and its own currency. The documentary tells the story of Hayat's exciting and at the same time emotional journey. From the moment she boards the plane and travels into the unknown Hayat will be thinking about her life in Spain and how it would have been different had she grown up in Africa. This huge culture shock - the status of women the veil that she does not know how to wear correctly or the Somali language that is completely unknown to her despite the fact that ethnically speaking she belongs to this community - will make her journey a way to better understand where she comes from.
