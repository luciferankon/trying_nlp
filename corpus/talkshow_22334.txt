When Bradley Voorhees created the Oh-My-Gleed! series it was after having just watched the entire Glee series the first season of The Glee Project and what had been aired of TGP season 2 up to that point all within 1 month. Following the first 2 aired episodes of The Glee Project's second season Voorhees immediately began producing episodes of Oh-My-Gleed! that would become available to the public the day after The Glee Project episodes would air on Oxygen. Then one day in late July Voorhees' gal-pal Rose Stahl confesses that she's a huge fan of OMG! claiming that she looked forward to watching Voorhees deliver humorous commentary on The Glee Project episodes. Voorhees jokes with Stahl telling her to get her "Hunky-hubby Nick" to do the shows opening with her and he would sign them both on as the shows official announcers. Little more than a week later they made their debut on OMG! as the shows announcers on the episode entitled "The Glee Project: Actability - Recap" which was OMG!'s eighth episode airing on August 8 2012.
