Iran midfielder Niloufar Ardalan is known in her country as "Lady Goal" but the biggest goal she scored last year wasn't in a game. She needed her husband to approve the renewal of her passport to compete in international competitions but he refused citing her responsibilities to their son. With justice on her side she appealed to the courts and won not only her freedom to travel but progress for the women of Iran.
