China in Ethiopia is a documentary that tells the stories of two employees from a Chinese manufacturing company in Ethiopia which produces plastic products; the first subject is an Ethiopian employee called Seifu who is an interpreter of Chinese. A Chinese employee Lei Zhang is my second subject who is the sole resources purchaser for that company. With Chinese investment becoming a major feature Ethiopia's economy has been growing rapidly in recent years and Chinese manufacturing companies are the optimal work places for most Ethiopians as Chinese companies always offer a good salary and working environment; they also attract large numbers of Chinese people to come all the way from China to work there for a higher salary. Seifu and Zhang were two characters who had completely different backgrounds and personalities but they were living and working in the same place and fighting for the same goal which was to earn more money for their family. The film recorded the reality of their daily work after-work activities and revolved around how the value of 'family' influenced both subjects. The film is directed by myself I am currently a postgraduate student studying MA Documentary and Ethnographic Film Practice in University College London. China in Ethiopia is my graduation film which was shot independently in Ethiopia and editing alone in the United Kingdom.
