This film tells the story of a group of young women living on the street casualties of heroin and prostitution. Robbed of their childhood they now find themselves trapped in a spiral of addiction that too often leads to death. These stories offer answers to questions about my own past as a child who was taken from her drug-addled mother a prostitute but more than that just a girl.
