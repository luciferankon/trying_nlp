Kyle is the art director at the High Museum in Atlanta Georgia. He wants two things in life a male child and a van Gogh painting valued at 275000. His wife Brandy cannot conceive so he plans a camping trip where he will have her killed and hung to make it look like a racially motivated killing so he can collect the 50000 insurance policy which will enable him to get what he wants. Of course things don't go as planned.
