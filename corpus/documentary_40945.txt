This documentary interviews a number of Central Americans who tell their stories of their first hand journeys through Mexico's "Vertical Border" to get to the United States. The four thousand kilometers that the migrants must travel through Mexico is where they risk their money lives and health in order to reach the United States. These are sad tales from those at the bottom of globalism's human barrel; these migrants have truly been reduced to "de nadie" "no one."
