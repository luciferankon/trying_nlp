Based on Schiller's play of the same name Don Carlos was written for the Paris Op√©ra in 1865-66 in the tradition of a French grand opera. Repeatedly revised and performed in Italian as Don Carlo the opera is seen here in the version that Verdi prepared for Modena in 1886. In many respects this is Verdi's most ambitious and most forward-looking work.
