The view to the sea from the most easterly point on the North American continent is infinitely expansive and affords no stability of perception. The horizon there changes quickly dramatically and so completely that worlds appear and disappear in minutes. Shifting integrity the long space condenses and thins retreats and advances reveals and obscures materializes and dematerializes brightens and dulls. Fermeuse is the registration of a magical yet unnerving phenomenon visible from Pouch Cove Newfoundland - it occurs in a largely untraveled pristine harsh and remote landscape. Occasional glimpses and photographs constitute "attention" yet fail to communicate the immensity of the drama where the threshold of the axis mundi is suspended. The video is a timepiece that tracks individual moments of time while presenting as a rhythmic whole. It regulates horizontal unpredicability yet does not keep pace with the time it takes the earth to make a complete revolution around the sun nor the time it takes the earth to complete one rotation on its axis. Fermeuse requires in making and viewing an enduring slow and specific focus that is atypical in a society prone to split attention simultaneous activity instant connectivity and multiple distractions.
