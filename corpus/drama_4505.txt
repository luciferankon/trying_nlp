Aston (Robert Shaw) a quiet reserved man lives alone in a top-floor cluttered room of a small abandoned house in a poor London district. He befriends and takes in Mac Davies (Donald Pleasence) an old derelict who has been fired from a menial job in a caf√©. In time Aston offers him a job as caretaker of the house. Aston's brother Mick (Alan Bates) - a taunting quasi-sadist - harasses the derelict when his brother is away countermanding his orders. Eventually Aston himself irritated by the cantankerous old man puts him out.
