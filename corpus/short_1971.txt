On his way to deliver a new Farmall F-20 tractor to a customer a local McCormick-Deering dealer pays a sales visit to another nearby farmer who owns a similar but 10-years-older model. To overcome the farmer's belief that his tractor is just as good as the new one the dealer points out the many mechanical improvements and increase in power and reliability of the new F-20. The dealer also reminds the farmer that all of his implements will still fit the new model and that the resale or trade-in value of his old tractor is high.
