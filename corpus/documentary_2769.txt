When Idaho Legislator Curtis Bowers wrote a "letter to the editor" about the drastic changes in America's culture it became the feature story on the evening news people protested at the Capitol and for weeks the local newspapers were filled with responses. He realized then... he'd hit on something. Ask almost anyone and you'll hear "Communism is dead! The Berlin Wall came down." Thought the word communism isn't used anymore this film will show the ideas behind it are alive and well. Join Bowers for a fascinating look at the people and groups that have successfully targeted America's morality and freedom in their effort to grind America down. It's a well documented AGENDA.
