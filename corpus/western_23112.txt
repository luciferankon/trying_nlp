Jimmy and partner Dusty have bought a ghost town in the Cherokee strip. When they arrive they find their other partner Lasses has sold 51% to four crooks. The four then fake a gold rush to bring in people. Jimmy's plan is to have the strip annexed to Texas but when election day arrives the outlaws control the ballot box and also seal off the town to keep others away.
