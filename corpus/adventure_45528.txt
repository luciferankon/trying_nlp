As the film fades in from black you are in a first-person view of a tropical jungle with a river running in front of you. As you stand up there are bodies and boat wreckage strewn about. Picking up a journal you learn that you are ALEC REDSON the man leading a rescue mission to find his brother ERIC who is missing in the Bermuda Triangle. Your boat crashed into an uncharted island that seemed to appear out of nowhere. Journeying outward you find another journal farther off written by another crew member F. GOSTLING who writes that he went on ahead and to catch up with him further up in the forest. There are strange sounds and creatures watching you from the trees and you find evidence of a native Indian civilization on the island. As you journey through the forest you are always one step behind Gostling who has recorded his find of an underground compound and will meet you there. Arriving at the compound you find that it is overrun by the strange and hostile creatures who are persecuting the local native inhabitants of the island. You find the last journal left by Gostling who has written that he's been wounded and cannot go on. Subsequent journals by the native inhabitants hint that your arrival is viewed by them as the coming of their messiah and savior. You meet a native of the island who leads you through the forest doing battle with the hostile creatures. The native leads you to another compound where you find Eric who is being held by the hostile creatures. After rescuing Eric you both fight off the mother creature and kill it saving the natives from persecution as you both escape on the only remaining boat.
