This is an omnibus consisting of three stories all of which deal with deviations of the human psyche. In the story "Waltz" we learn about the first sexual experiences of a man who attends a dancing school in Split. In the story "Ave Maria" a cruel crime destroys a pastoral idyll and in the story "Seas" we meet a family living on an isolated island that goes through an existential crisis ending in murder.
