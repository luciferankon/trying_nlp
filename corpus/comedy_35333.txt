Adolf "Dolfy" Hitler is trapped in his bunker in Berlin with his minions. Hitler goes on several misadventures in what seems to take place in multiple parallel universes from relatively serious ones such as "The Enemy Within" to the more lighthearted one where Hitler leads Germany in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Hitler is joined by Otto Gunsche who informs him on everything even the obvious and pointless Hans Krebs who has a fetish for maps and fish Alfred Jodl who objects to every Hitler's plans Wilhelm Burgdorf who loves to booze Hermann Goering the ever-hungry who likes to devour everything Joseph "Skeletor" Goebbels the ever-loyal but ugly henchman of Hitler among others. Another faction exists within the bunker which was led by Antics master Hermann Fegelein who likes to cause mischief within the bunker. Hitler longs to kill the seemingly-immortal Fegelein but just can't. If not busy dealing with Fegelein Hitler rants on various mundane stuffs.
