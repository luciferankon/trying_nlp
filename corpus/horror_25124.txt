Fifty years ago two innocent souls from opposing families fell in love - and paid for their forbidden love with their lives. Because of the curse placed upon them these two lost souls can only be together on the 30th of November the Night of the Wolves - and on this night these two creatures will do anything to be together again. Three friends George Daniel and Bogdan find themselves in the middle of this supernatural love story. Unwittingly they will become the bridge between the material and the spectral as they track down a mysterious medallion in an old abandoned house. The three friends will face their darkest fears that night hunted down by the forces that they have disturbed. Love is eternal as the saying goes. Unless it kills you.
