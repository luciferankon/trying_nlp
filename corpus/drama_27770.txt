Ang√©lique is sixty. But she is not old. The best proof is that she is still working as a taxi girl in a cabaret by the French-German border. And that her love for men is intact. And that she keeps loving partying. And that there is nothing for her like night life... Of course clients are becoming rarer and rarer. Sure a few of them are offensive to her and treat her like meat... But what a surprise when Michel a friendly retired miner asks her to marry him! Will she be able to become a respected married lady? Will she manage to make it up with her family? Can she really say farewell to her present lifestyle?
