'Aarhus Stories' is the result of an unconventional partnership between film directors and song writers. The song writers' songs replace the traditional manuscript and challenge the director in an entirely new way. The films have all been shot in Aarhus in 24 hours and they all last three to ten minutes. At a small bar in NÅ™rregade singer/songwriter Peter Sommer and film director Nikolaj Bendix Skyum Larsen invite the audience to a small talk about life.
