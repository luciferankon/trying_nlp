1. "Primer Santa Ana" is a creative documentary from the heart of the emerging Downtown Artist Village. It consists of eleven vignettes intimately told through the eyes of the people featured along with a score from many local musicians. "Primer" sets the table for the individuals to give heartfelt accounts of their lives the history of Santa Ana and insights into the youthful artistic businesses now calling Downtown Santa Ana home. We feature luminaries as diverse as MacArthur Foundation Fellow Rueben Martinez Janice Lowry whose life journals will be archived in the Smithsonian Archives of American Artists local historian Tim Rush who gives a history of architecture as he cooks a meal fit for a king. Although each story is independent of one another the common thread of hope drive and future are all tied one way or another to Santa Ana.
