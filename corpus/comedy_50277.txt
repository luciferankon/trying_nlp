Lori runs a support group for guys who lack...guyness. The men gather weekly(and weakly)to compare experiences listen to advice and try to find their balls through "Test-icles" and exercises like the "Stim Sim" a green screen Stimulation Simulation custom-designed to their specific issues. As is common with support groups the guys have joined with the hopes of improving what's lacking in this area of their lives but in the process find friends and create bonds with other struggling ball-less men. This series profiles their adventures friendships and journey into manliness.
