Leanne Darren Joshua Sierra Michelle and Roxie meet at a New Years Eve party that none of them particularly wanted to attend. After spending a few hours exchanging small talk with the other guest looking busy on their phones and numbing their anxiety/boredom with a few drinks these six strangers eventually find themselves bonding exceptionally well in a quiet corner. They part ways after the ball drops and exchange contact info. There is an unspoken understanding between the six that they won't actually reconnect. Party goers never usually do. But over the next couple of months each of them realizes that they desperately want to recapture the ease fun and newness of that night. Part one looks at each character's life in the time in between the New Years Eve party and the reunion lunch they have two months later.
