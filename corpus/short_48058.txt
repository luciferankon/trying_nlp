To record the work he built a special device containing a stack of wooden picture frames. Attached to a tall industrial crane the frames were released from a height of fifteen meters. The camera was placed right in the center of the frames and captured the frames' movement while they fell down. The slow motion recording of 240 still frames per second allows us to experience the movement in detail. While the frames become smaller and smaller in perspective as they move further away from our view they are immediately followed by the next frame and the next one until they've all reached the floor and found a place to rest.
