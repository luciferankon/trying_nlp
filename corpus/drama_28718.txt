Zee and Robert Blakeley are members of swinging London's upper crust whose unique love-hate marriage heads towards destruction when Robert falls in love with a beautiful young widow named Stella and Zee goes through a series of scheming adventures to break Robert and Stella up. Approaching middle age the Blakeleys - architect Robert and his brash overbearing wife Zee - are Londoners who are able to indulge in their collective and individual narcissistic wants because of their financial standing and the fact that they have no children. They have a passionate love/hate relationship based largely on those individual wants. At a party they meet widowed Stella a couturier. Robert is immediately attracted to her. Robert and Stella openly embark on an affair which for Robert is merely the latest dalliance in his life. However the two fall in love as for Robert Stella fulfills those parts of his life that Zee can't or won't since Stella is the antithesis of Zee: understanding with an air of serenity. Zee does whatever she can to disrupt what seems to be the idyllic life that Robert and Stella have set up for themselves moving from one measure to another as each successive one doesn't achieve what Zee wants. Through it all Robert and Zee continue on with their love/hate relationship one where Stella may merely become a pawn for them to play with especially as Zee discovers something from Stella's past.
