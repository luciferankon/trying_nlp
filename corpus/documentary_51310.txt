Thos autobiography by Corinne Cantrill traces an eventful life in a quest for self. Through photographs recollection and introspection it also becomes a reflection by a practicing filmmaker on the process of translating photographic traces into a film and the way photographs from snapshots to studio portraits can be the means of appraising one's self-image.
