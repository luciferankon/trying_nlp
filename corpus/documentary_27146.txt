A documentary about the life of an ex-transvestite: from his miserable childhood marked by his semi-slavery work and begging to prostitution in the streets of the capital of Para√≠ba until his transformation into a protestant pastor. With the construction of his own church he does a social work in the poor community where he lives. Besides he dedicates himself to what he considers his greatest mission: to bring gays lesbians and transvestites to the Lord and into heterosexuality.
