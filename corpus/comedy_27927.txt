Open letter to audience: I was recently convinced by a childhood friend (Francis Enwright) to shoot a documentary which chronicled the making of his most current theatre production. Out of respect for him and due to his persistent insistence I put other projects aside to undertake this objective documentation. "Specific Conceptualism" is not only his contribution to avant garde theatre but best sums up the tangled cobweb of circuits gears and tubes that make up his neural network. -Art Ferguson (documentrist)
