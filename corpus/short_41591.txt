Crashing HOLLYWOOD is my story of going to HOLLYWOOD and trying to pitch an idea for a kids show to the major studios. Needless to say the road was long arduous and full of hardship. When I started this journey I had no idea that it was not possible unless you had an agent a lawyer or at least some vague clue of how the business of show actually works. It wasn't easy but it was fun.
