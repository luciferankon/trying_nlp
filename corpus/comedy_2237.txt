The female employees of the poultry-processing factory find relief from their monotonous work in chatting about weddings and marriages. The very young Zdena ('Marta Vancurov√°' (qv)) too dreams about a white veil and an entourage of bridesmaids. On her return home from work she runs into a peculiar man on an abandoned road who pertinaciously offers to read her palm for a few crowns to buy soup. His augury is rather usual - wealth and poverty suffering and happiness. Then however he declares that Zdena must marry exactly on 3 November of that year otherwise she will be unhappy.
