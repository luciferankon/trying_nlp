Two men meet in the middle of a bleak infinitely flat desert. Clinging to the last shreds of their existence neither character can remember how they got there or the last time they saw anything-a person a town any sign of life. The film's layers of metaphor and meaning unfold as the characters warily assess each other. They possess conflicting and complementary characteristics revealing the film's underlying paradox: they both rely upon and threaten each other's survival. The tense symbolic narrative is further complicated with the revelation that one character is carrying a piece of the other's soul though neither person knows it. This visually stunning short examines the intricacies and contradictions of the human condition
