VÃ­ctor Maytland is getting close to the dawn of his career. After years of work together his producer decides to stop financing his porn movies which are as rich in excesses as they are in narrative ideas and social content. His curious craft seems to be coming to an end. Devastated and relying on the scarce resources he can gather he embarks on one last challenge: making a movie based on his memoirs as a young activist. Aided by his son and a few actors that he rescues from a weird porn reality show he goes deep into the delta region of Tigre in order to shape his dream. Although he knows that the ghost of an old lost love stalks there.
