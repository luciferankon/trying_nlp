The one-hour pilot "Geezers" celebrates family values rediscovered by four retired men from vastly different cultures and backgrounds who are united in their fear of growing old alone and the identity crises triggered by retirement. This drama-comedy reveals in flashbacks how the four men meet and end up forming their new "family unit." Through laughter and tears the four geezers face estrangement issues with their real families while grappling with aging problems of health mortality and loss of sexual prowess. Embracing both a homeless runaway teenager who has escaped an abusive family situation and a young neighbor rich in material possessions but poor in family support and love this unusual household learns lessons in forgiveness and acceptance that help them start the healing processes in their own lives. This video emphasizes the need all of us have for love acceptance and understanding. "Geezers" presents in a compassionate humorous depiction how unrelated individuals from all walks of life can find the support and love of a family in the most unexpected places. As today's families are increasingly described as "dysfunctional" and are frequently separated by miles and disagreements this story illustrates that blood relationships are not a necessary ingredient for a loving family.
