A girl takes drugs we will not know why we hardly can guess. We feel that she is there for others those whose daily lives became so opaque and so obsessive. The film operates a statement between intimate expression and collective experience. Thus the body of the girl tells the story that she will not say : the intact mystery that binds in her flesh the fragments of a common pain.
