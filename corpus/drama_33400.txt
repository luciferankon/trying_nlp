In an English retirement home all is not as it seems for newly retired couple Winston and Cathy Skeet. Adjusting to their retirement life is complicated by Winston's failing memory and the mysterious Dimitri a Russian resident who went to the same boy's private school as Winston. At first Dimitri seems willing to help Winston unlock his lost memories though a word association game called 'If I Say' but as Winston's recollections begin to take a darker turn Cathy begins to question Dimitri's motives. Perhaps some memories are best forgotten.
