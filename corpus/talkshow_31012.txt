From the official website: Bill Gates is the most successful entrepreneur in American history. Every day the products his company has created are used by more than a billion people especially young people who probably have no idea the role Mr. Gates and Microsoft play in their everyday life. But who is he? How did he rise to become the youngest multi-billionaire ever in the U.S.? What is his vision for the future - the world of work school and leisure - that awaits young people who increasingly lead a new digital lifestyle where they can on demand get what they want when they want and how they want? "The Notorious B.G." is a special that features the first MTV forum with Microsoft founder Bill Gates and MTV News correspondent Gideon Yago discussing the road ahead with a diverse group of approximately 80 tech-savvy 16- to 24-year-olds.
