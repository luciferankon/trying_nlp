Since the October 17 revelation that the Columbus Crew - a founder member of Major League Soccer and a previous league champion - were under threat of relocation to Austin Texas for the 2019 MLS season by their owner Anthony Precourt the fans in Columbus have rallied around its team with its grassroots #SaveTheCrew campaign. Columbus was an essential part of the creation of MLS and later became the first team in the US to construct a soccer-specific stadium. Crew fans have shown themselves to be true soccer fans by sticking by their team no matter what as will be seen in this film. The film also shows how Mr Precourt's purchase of the team in 2013 led to an improvement in the team's form and how his past willingness to engage with the local fan base was warmly received. Given the ongoing developments about a possible move to Austin we have made sure to fairly present his arguments as publicly stated.
