The Mormon Tabernacle Choir hosts their annual Christmas concert. Each year they invite celebrity guests to sing along with the choir and to host the immensely popular concert. Brian Stokes Mitchell sings his memorable 'Through Heavens's Eyes' from the Prince of Egypt soundtrack. He jokes ' I have this amazing song I sang for this movie but I don't get to sing it because I need a large choir to accompany me..' (looks around) 'ah! Look what we have here!' The piece is phenomenal. Mitchell brings gaiety and fun to the beloved concert.
