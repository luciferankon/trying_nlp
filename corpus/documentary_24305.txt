According to most Palestinians "Israeli Occupation" means Tel Aviv Ber Sheva and Haifa and for their leaders Palestine should be built "From the River to the Sea". Meaning should replace Israel from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. In this disturbing film "From the River to the Sea" a revised version of "Hostages of Hatred" acclaimed director Pierre Rehov sets out to tell us the real story of those men women and children who have been shamefully used as mere pawns for over 50 years by Arab leaders at first by Palestinian leaders later on and until this very day but also by the United Nations' body that was specially created to supposedly take care of them: the United Nations Relief and Works Agency UNWRA.
