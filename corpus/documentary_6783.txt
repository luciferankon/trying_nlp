HANGMAN's GRAVEYARD follows a team of archaeologists as they unearth a forgotten graveyard behind the infamous Old Don Jail in downtown Toronto. Buried beneath what is now a parking lot are the skeletal remains of 15 men who went to the gallows between 1880 and 1932. Who were these men? What were their crimes? Hangman's Graveyard is a dark and haunting tale of rogues rakes and villains and a modern day investigation to uncover and identify the remains of inmates executed at Toronto's notorious Don Jail. Inmates who were unceremoniously buried in the Murderer's Graveyard directly behind the jail in some cases buried mere feet from where they met their maker at the end of the hangman's noose. Who were these men? What were their crimes?
