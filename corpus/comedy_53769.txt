With a young daughter two baby mamas and his own mama breathing down his neck Ronald "R.C." Carr (Travis Winfrey) has got more ladies in his life than he can handle! He's one hit song away from fame and fortune as a music producer but he can't seem to find the rhythm that makes him a good reliable father. Between his love interests (Caryn Ward and Chyna Layne) scheming to get him to settle down and his unresolved issues with his own father R.C. has got some growing up to do. It'll take finding the right harmony of love and forgiveness to be a real man and a true father.
