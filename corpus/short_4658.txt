In this work Tim White-Sobieski explores his own split personality. He observes his "encaged" desires and lets them take over his rational side for a moment. He places his face in the center of the vertical screen. He bars it from the viewer by the horizontal intermingling bands. The stripes move like sliding doors creating an illusion of dual reality. The artist concentrates on a human ability to live two realms - physical and spiritual - at one time. In his book Theater and its Double Antonin Artaud advocated for a unique language made up between thought and action. Tim White-Sobieski develops the visual language between his juxtaposed personalities to interpret differences between action and thought. Main theme of Desire departs from erotic fantasy. The artist pictures himself as a two-faced Janus - capable of both innocence and harm. His face is shown shattered into many pieces - "circles of desire". The artist created perforated fragments of body parts that overlap in his imagination. These "confetti" multiply and grow until they cover his face completely. Eroticism serves as a further environment in which White-Sobieski examines his identity. He divides his face on the screen in two halves that co-exist in different emotional mediums. Like Shakespearean Iago the artist says: "I am not what I am". This reference to duality signifies his deceptiveness but also marks him as an observer of his own behavior. Dual personality is usually a person who has dramatically alternating type of behavior thoughts and feelings. These personalities often are direct opposites and dominate at different times. These types of individuals strive to solve their identity crisis. They actually have a great struggle maintaining the integrity of a single self.
