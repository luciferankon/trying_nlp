Tada Keisuke and Gyoten Haruhiko are two friends who work as "Benri-ya" (Handymen Jack of all trades) in a fictional city called Mahoro in Japan. The story is different between each episode ( Not counting episodes 9-10 and 11-12) So each episode has a different thing going on. The two protagonists find themselves doing strange tasks meeting strange people and constantly struggling for cash.
