Russell Walker a charismatic rogue who poaches animals for sale on the black market is caught in the act by an Aboriginal shaman. To teach him a lesson the shaman casts a Dreamtime spell trapping Russell in the body of a koala. Unless he makes amends he will stay a koala forever. He is shipped off to a New York zoo where he is befriended by Sophie a feisty wise-cracking ten-year old girl unable to come to terms with the recent death of her father. An extraordinary friendship develops between them and each helps the other to cope and deal with life's challenges. With Russell's cunning and Sophie's ingenuity this unlikely duo set out in a race against the clock to get back to Australia and have the spell reversed before it's too late. A delightfully witty blend of heart and humor RUSSELL is an emotionally compelling story about earning a second chance in life.
