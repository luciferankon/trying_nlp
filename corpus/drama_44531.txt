The father of fourteen-year old Natasa is the chairman of the housing department at the Municipal National Committee. His position is probably the cause of the high living standard of his family. Natasa has everything even a box in the local theatre but despite all this she is still unhappy. Her parents are never able to find time for her and the group of four of her girl-classmates to which Natasa would like to belong envy her and misuse her. Natasa meets a boy named Petr and is going to have her first date with him. But the girls aware of her date lock her in the school cloakroom and hypocritically offer themselves to carry a letter of explanation to Petr. But instead of Natasa's apologies they write and deliver another letter in which the girl is shamelessly offering herself to him.
