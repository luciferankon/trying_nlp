Rockwell has been dealt a challenging hand; he's black gay and hood born and raised. Rockwell is the son of a brutish cop the pride and joy of a social media savvy mother-in-charge and the younger brother of the brawny and brainy James. The brother's bond is the epicenter of each other's lives; no secrets between them. But all families have secrets right? Out in the streets we meet a fresh out of jail Sinclair whose mystery is just as luring as his obsession with Rockwell. Sinclair takes us on a trip that will have us questioning reality all while doing his best to show Rockwell why two boys who barely made it out of remedial math are made for each other.
