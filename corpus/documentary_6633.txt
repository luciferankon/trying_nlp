In the Fever of Love is the first in a trilogy by post-modern dance pioneer Anna Halprin in memory of her late husband landscape architect Lawrence Halprin celebrating their 70-years of marriage and collaboration. Remembering Lawrence a film for Anna Halprin invites the viewer to share in the process and performance of this provocative dance. Halprin draws on powerful sources: a live participatory audience; sacred text from the Biblical "Song of Songs;" the treasured outdoor dance deck designed for her by Lawrence nestled in a redwood grove adjacent to their home; intensely affectionate energy danced by Dana and Shinichi Iova-Koga; the mystical presence and vocalizations of Dohee Lee; the sharing of Lawrence's wartime love letters read by Jim Cave; and most importantly a gallery of erotic drawings sketched by Lawrence for Anna some 60 years previous found only after his death.
