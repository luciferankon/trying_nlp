Badass TV was a late night cult British television show aimed squarely at fans of Eurotrash. Ice-T and Andrea Oliver presented a contemporary look at blacksploitation in modern entertainment mediums - Movies music and television. Badass TV was part satire and part social commentary with Ice-T dressed head to toe as a stereotypical cartoon pimp playing mischief-maker against Oliver's more contained persona. A short lived show airing for only four episodes.
