(1959) Robert Hossein Marina Vlady Robert Le Beal. A brilliant "little" spy film. Hossein and Vlady play mysterious characters who meet up one night in a lonely cabin in the wilds of Normandy. They are both spies but whom do they work for-the Allies or the Nazis. Vlady is a real stunner. A stylish underrated film. From 16mm.
