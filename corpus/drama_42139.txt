In these days both South and North Korea are more sensitive to North Korea's nuclear issue. In this perspective we try to go back and talk about 2000's Korean summit meeting and intend to look back the peace on Korea territory in the past. The family members in this film do not know even each member's life and death. They cannot meet each other too. We intend to show the real love through their mournful and caring situations.
