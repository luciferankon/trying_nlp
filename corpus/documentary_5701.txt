Shunka is a vision of the material and spiritual worlds and their coalescence; and of finding stark poetry in the haze of the every day in a small community in the Badlands. Through Donna a psychic medium contacting the ghosts of a family's past we witness life interacting and sometimes conflicting with the mystical. Through Ed an old soldier and cowboy whose detailed memories evoke a love for and connection with the things that have passed. Shunka patiently and beautifully broadens its focus. From insects devouring plants; to humans sharing old experiences and taking part in new ones; to ghosts unwittingly haunting the living; to animals quick to inhabit the material present and to depart. This film of vivid images is eager to explore the quick and the dead; and the spaces between.
