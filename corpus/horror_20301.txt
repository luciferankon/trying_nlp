When a group of unsuspecting teenagers get together for a party at a secluded lakeside cabin things don't turn out quite as they'd hoped. What begins as a wholesome weekend getaway quickly goes from bad to worse. Little do they know that amidst their tomfoolery a bloodthirsty cult of territorial creatures has arisen from the shadows surrounding the cabin. It's up to Mike (Cole Stevenson) to save his girlfriend Jamie (Laura Reinertson) his brother Jeff (Nick Koscik) and his rag-tag team of friends from certain doom. The question is can he rise to the challenge? It's a vacation straight from the depths of hell. And in order to find salvation they'll have no choice but to go beyond the darkness.
