A newspaper reporter and a bunch of scientists fly a rocket to Mars just to find out that Martians look exactly like us. Mars is running low on one of their natural resources (Corium) and plan to steal the Earth astronauts' rocket and conquer Earth. The Martian underground helps the Earthmen stop the insidious plan. A space ship carrying four scientists and a wisecracking news reporter lands on the planet Mars and discovers signs of an underground civilization. They are greeted by its apparently friendly population and made to feel welcome while they repair their ship for the voyage home. Dr. Jim Barker the expedition's leader falls in love with the beautiful Alita daughter of Tillamar an influential member of the Martian governing council and learns that Ikron the council's militant leader plans on using the repaired ship to invade the Earth. Natural resources on Mars are dwindling and unless the Martians can recolonize on Earth their civilization is doomed. Barker hides his knowledge of the council's plans tries to complete the repair work ahead of schedule so their party along with Alia can return to Earth without betraying their plans to Ikron.
