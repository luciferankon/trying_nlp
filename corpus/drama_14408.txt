Based on Franz Kafka's The Castle. A certain K. appears in a snow-covered godforsaken village as if out of nowhere. All the power in the village belongs to the mysterious Castle that strangers are barred from accessing. K. presents himself to the locals as the Land Surveyor "summoned by the Governor himself." But he is denied work and a place to stay. The only person that doesn't turn her back on him is barmaid Frieda lover of the powerful official Klamm. K. seeks a meeting with Klamm thinking that is the only way to get something out of the soulless bureaucratic machine. But without realizing it he soon begins to play by its rules setting himself up for inevitable defeat.
