Between Space and Silence is a feature-length documentary on composer and pianist Ludovico Einaudi. Several years in the making and featuring footage shot on five continents the film is an in-depth look at Ludovico's life and career exploring his roots inspirations and influences. This colourful journey takes us from a packed Royal Albert Hall in London to a riverboat in Bangkok via a bomb-scarred Beirut among many other locations. Running as a thread throughout is an intimate solo performance captured at London's Cadogan Hall. Offering exclusive footage from Ludovico's personal archives the film explores the man behind the music through his own words and those of his friends and colleagues including some of the biggest names in world music. This openness to different musical cultures and traditions is powerfully evidenced by the spellbinding throb of Puglia's Taranta Festival his sensitive collaboration with Mali's Ballak√© Sissoko or with the deeply spiritual alchemy of the sound of Turkey's Mercan Dede. Made with the full co-operation of Ludovico and his management the film features never-before-seen performances gained from unprecedented access to this understated artist who has captured the imagination of audiences around the world.
