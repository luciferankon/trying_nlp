Monster Auditions are short animated monologues of monsters who are visiting a life-coach. Each episode starts on the couch as the monster talks candidly about their problems in a human way. Across the series we meet a vampire with a crush a zombie battling an addiction a blob monster who feels typecast and a human fly coming to terms with his conception. All are facing an audition or life-moment of some kind - an event which will change their lives or possibly just their afternoon.
