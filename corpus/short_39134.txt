A young visiting couple from out-of-town is led on a guided tour of Los Angeles and its environs by a familiar resident (Stanley Livingston) and his wife (Paula Drake) all captured by the panoramic triple-lensed Cinerama camera. Some popular and some not so well known sights of the city shine in this urban travelogue lark including the Griffith Observatory Angel's Flight funicular railway and a sailboat cruise from San Pedro culminating in the evening's highlight a visit to the Cinerama Dome Theater in Hollywood. This was the first film shot in 3-panel Cinerama in 50 years.
