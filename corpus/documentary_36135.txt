'A Disconnected Rhythm' is an arts documentary created at the point where two disciplines intersect: the medical and the artistic. It follows composer Ian Wilson's collaboration with the National Centre for Arts & Health as he creates a work of art inspired by Parkinson's Disease. The film charts Ian's 5-week stint as 'Composer in Residence' at Tallaght Hospital. We follow the project's progress primarily through Ian's eyes as he attends consultations and treatments meets patients and their families and observes the doctors who are passionate about the therapeutic value of art.
