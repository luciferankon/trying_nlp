Every day in our lives we never take the time to appreciate the two great blue beauties of the world; the sky and the ocean. Why do we do this? Why do we ignore these two amazing wonders of the world? Is it because we are so used to seeing them every day that they just come off as unimportant in our hectic lives? Or is it that most of us have a fear of letting go even if it's just for a short time? When was the last time you dived into the ocean and mingled with the gill-clad creatures of the deep or even looked up at the sky to appreciate its beauty and splendor? I'll bet none of you have even considered even diving from the sky and experiencing one of the great rushes of life. Well this short is for you. Come away from the land you once knew and take the plunge into the "Equilibrium of Diving." Here in this short film you will see and experience a combination of sky and undersea diving footage that is graced with a beautiful poem which speaks of the freedom present within the two great blue wonders of the world. This is a film about letting go of the monotony of the mainland and becoming one with two vast frontiers of excitement along with sampling a taste of the ultimate rushes in life. Dive from the sky free-falling just past the chaos and mayhem of the world and then enter the serene sea for encounters with creatures that welcome you into their world with open fins.
