Dramatists Guild of America member Michael Justin Lee brings a modern transgressive reimagining of Henrik Ibsen's greatest work to the screen. Featuring an Asian-American lead and an all-female principal cast its portrayal of Nora as an Asian-American plays first into and subsequently against the archetype of the submissive Asian woman. Its transformation of Dr. Rank Helmer and Krogstad into female characters elevates the conventionally understood male/female conflict into a more encompassing humanist dynamic which Henrik Ibsen himself claimed to have been his intent.
