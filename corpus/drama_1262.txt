Lidia grows pigeons and lives a mundane existence with a husband and two children. Denisa has a boyfriend that needs new sneakers. Vanesa dreams of finding a boyfriend with green eyes. Three different women share a workplace and voice their daily concerns to each other in conversations. You might think they are secretaries who enjoy chatting about the banalities of life and have their daily coffee break together. Just a normal life only that they are prostitutes in order to survive. The daily routine ends in a humiliating confrontation with the police and some ice-cream.
