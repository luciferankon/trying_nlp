A mother and her daughter are waiting for her English tutor to arrive at their house. The mother has only just heard that today's lesson will be taught by a substitute. For "Robert-sensei" this is his first time visiting and teaching at a Japanese family home. This short film is loosely based on the story of Ranald MacDonald who was the very first Westerner to teach English to the Japanese in the 1800's. Using the expression "a deer in headlights" it is a depiction of how a foreign English teacher may have been received back in the day. This is the second installment of "Japanese History".
