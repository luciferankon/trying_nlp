Three decades later Nathan Forrest Winters is a child sex abuse survivor best known for his role as Casey in the 1987 horror film 'Clownhouse' written and directed by Victor Salva. Known for his films 'Powder' and the 'Jeepers Creepers' series Salva was also the man who sexually abused Nathan for six years of his childhood and was convicted and sentenced to three years of which he served a mere eighteen months at a treatment center in Napa valley California. At the age of 12 Nathan's journey and search for healing began. At 20 he found his voice as a survivor. He remains intent on raising awareness to educate and to shed light onto these darkest of crimes while being a living proof there is healing found in the wake of abuse. Nathan is currently in production of a documentary entitled 'Pure Eternus: The Babysitter' directed by Connar Frazier. 'Babysitter' tells the story of Nathan's journey from victim to survivor. Nathan is also fulfilling a dream by writing all the music for the film. Nathan is also in the early stages of starting a non-profit organization called 'we R their voice' and booking venues for his 'Raised Awareness' speaking tour that should launch by spring of next year.
