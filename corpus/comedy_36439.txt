To further the aims of the St Trinian's Marriage Bureau run by Flash Harry the school contrives to win a competition with a European "Goodwill" trip as prize to the horror of the Ministry of Education. Joe Mangan father of a sixth former and hiding out at the school after a Hatton Garden diamond robbery is persuaded to travel with the girls as their new headmistress leaving the real one trussed up in the belfry. At least her arrival had allowed the remains of the Army unit sent in to keep order to evacuate. The headmistress of St Trinian's is jailed and to try and keep order the army and the police are called in they don't stand a chance. This time the hellcats of St. Trinian's want to get to Italy where a rich playboy wants to select one of them as his wife (little does he know what he's letting himself in for). To get to Italy in term time they have to win an essay writing competition it's easy when you know how. In Europe they run amok and become involved in jewel theft and their normal brand of chaos.
