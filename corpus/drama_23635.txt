As the music is at the heart of LOST SOUL project for the first time Quebec Anik Jean and her musicians will play the soundtrack 'LIVE' during the projection of the film somewhat like the silent film era. This project was first conceived in projection - concert format but it will also be available in a traditional version with integrated soundtrack to the film directly.
