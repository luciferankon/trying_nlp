Set in fictional Denison Maryland this daytime serial focused the on the father-and-son team of doctors Jerry and David Malone who practiced at Valley Hospital. "Young Dr. Malone" was notable for its use of actual medical crises and lighthearted humor both of which were generally absent in late-50's serials.
