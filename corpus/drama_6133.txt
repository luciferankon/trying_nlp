This documentary-feature contains scenes of an adult nature coarse language; male and female nudity and violence. 'Grabbed' from selected scenes from three of Virtual Alien/Nick Peterson Psychological Thrillers "In and Out of Planet Earth" "The Complete Map of the Universe" "Speed of Light" and the black comedy: "Writing on the Wall". What transpires in the stories is the sheer dementia of all the characters.
