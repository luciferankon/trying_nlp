A senior citizen - driven by the only wish to live his life peacefully - becomes very inventive in killing every trouble-maker in his neighbourhood and letting it look like accidents. Only a retired superintendent suspects murder but neither of his former colleagues believes him. So he starts to investigate the cases on his own commencing a grotesque but nevertheless deadly duel (German "Zweikampf") between both pensioners.
