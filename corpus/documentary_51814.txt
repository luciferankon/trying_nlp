Diane Schuur performs live 15 tunes with Big Bop Nouveau (including fan favorite Carl Fischer) in this film. The final two songs (Just Friends and It Don't Mean A Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing) are performed with Maynard. It's a delight to hear Diane and Maynard trade riffs with Diane occasionally mimicking Maynard's exuberant sound.
