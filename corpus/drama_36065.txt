We do not think twice before killing a sick animal but we will stop a human from killing themselves who is sick an. Why? What make it wrong for a human to decide to end their life when all they have to look forward to is pain and suffering into a slow death. Last Breath is about a young woman's journey to choose her death. Diagnosed with a terminal disease and treatments that leave her unable to care for herself. She has chosen to stop treatments that are spd dyeing her death and live her life until her death birthday. She starts planning her death to land on her birthday six months from the day she ends her treatment. But she soon learns that others that do not even know here decide that she should not have this right. They take her to court to force the courts to admit her to a hospital until she dies or natural cause or from the treatments. A week before her birthday the court orders her to house arrest until a decision can be made. She is informed that she has 24 hours to report to the Probations Monitoring department to have an ankle monitor placed on her to confirm her locations. Two days before her death birthday she planned on leaving the state because they do not honor suicide. The courts knew this when they made the plans. Instead of reporting to the Monitoring Department she flees on the run she makes several videos telling the world of her wishes. Several people along the way help her. Somehow the police are three minutes too late to arrest her and shop her from killing herself.
