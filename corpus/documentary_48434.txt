These kids are no stars. Not yet. These extremely tall teenagers come into the US from Haiti using basketball as means to get an education. Although some of them will become top players we tell the story of the kids' quest to come back home - as much more capable persons. These kids are no stars. Not yet. Set mainly in present day Dallas TX and Port-au-Prince Haiti this vérité documentary features three main characters at three different stages of the same process. Supported by a nonprofit these extremely tall teenagers come to the United States from Haiti using basketball as means to get an education and help their own country change. We get close to Schnider 17 as he copes with his new quite exhausting and scheduled life in his guardian's apartment completely different from his way of living as a street kid in Haiti. We see him getting better at basketball and learning to tame his somewhat rebellious nature for the greater good. Experts already compare him to LeBron James when he was the same age. We meet Pierre 15 living with his mother in a makeshift house in the outskirts of Port-Au-Prince walking for hours every day to the amateur basketball court too poor to afford public transit. He is excited to study in the U.S. waiting for the nearest opportunity. We follow another Pierre 32 a retired pro basketball player operating the organization connecting kids to the colleges helping them with paperwork and genuinely caring for them as they retrace the steps he made years ago. Although some of them will become top basketball players this is not a sports documentary this film is about the kids' quest to come back home - as new much more capable persons.
