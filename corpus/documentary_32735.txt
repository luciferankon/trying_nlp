'Resettled: New Haven's Refugee Community' is a year-long documentary project produced by members of The Yale Politic. It explores New Haven's refugee community and advocates in a shifting political landscape. It features the voices of resettlement coordinators community activists and young refugees from Syria the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iraq all of whom live in New Haven. The Politic is proud to present its first-ever documentary Resettled: New Haven's Refugee Community. In September 2016 members of The Politic sought to investigate a New Haven-centered topic through film. We chose to focus on New Haven's refugee community and resettlement program because they exemplify the city's multiculturalism tolerance and activism. Given the growing politicization of refugee status we attempted to offer a localized alternative to the massive visual production surrounding refugees in international media. The 2016 election and subsequent Trump policies inevitably influenced the film's trajectory but it still centers around refugee experiences and the continuing efforts of resettlement and support services in New Haven. We hope you learn about the incredible work of people in this city and draw inspiration for future engagement.
