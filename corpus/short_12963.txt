An overweight man is dragged to a yard sale by his overbearing wife. At the yard sale a strange old man gives him an exercise tape called REDUCO. The old man claims the tape is perfect for getting rid of dead weight. The overweight man reluctantly takes the tape. That night he plops the tape into his VCR. Although not expecting much the man is gradually convinced by the trainer on the tape that in order to lose weight he must eliminate anyone who could possibly tempt him away from his diet - starting with his domineering wife.
