What would you do if you suddenly won a real live cow? This is what happens to Kajsa when she and her dad one day visit a local fair. All her life Kajsa has wanted an animal of her own and suddenly she wins PÃ¤rlan a cow in a raffle! But cows like Pearl need a lot of attention and work. For one they have to be milked twice a day and milking cows isn't all that easy if you're not used to it. When it's raining the cow has to be somewhere but if you live in an ordinary terraced house finding a place for the cow to live can be a bit of a problem. And of course cows need to eat too. Cows eat a lot. There is no way the grass in Kajsa's garden will be enough for a hungry cow. So no matter how hard Kajsa tries Pearl just doesn't enjoy living with Kajsa. In fact Pearl misses the country life and all of her cow friends.
