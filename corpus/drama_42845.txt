Doctor EMILIO MARTINEZ once a highly respected surgeon who gave up his lucrative practice to return to his roots and help those less fortunate. With him is Father HENRY CHOY an Asian Catholic priest. Father Choy then shows him a highly successful African-American educator ELMA CARTER who had just retired. Father Choy then suggested they contact Ms Carter and see if she would be interested in joining them to help form this special school. They could also get their old friend Officer CLARENCE O'DELL an Irish cop to point the worst kids their way. This is a fast-paced intense drama that follows this group as they struggle to put their plan into action.
