Today's Panama. Alma dreams she is getting married but the groom never shows up. Juana wants the white dress the ring. Malena is free...perhaps too much. Miguel is almost normal: he wants to make a Skydive. Loving. Get married. Be faithful. Decisions to make going for the new and unknown. Stories with a touch of irony and to think about it; in a hotel club and the door of a plane that opens into the void.
