Invisible Revolution a web documentary on Doug Engelbart the man who invented much of the information environment we live in today - the computer mouse word processing email hypertext and so on. In short: Interactive computing. This is his story and the story of his fellow dreamers thinkers doers - revolutionaries - who changed our lives forever. Doug's basic vision is to augment our ability to collectively solve urgent complex problems such as those listed by the UN's Millennium Development Goals. We hope you find Doug's story as important and inspirational as we do and that you will take the time to look beyond the tools he invented and reflect on the reason he invented them.
