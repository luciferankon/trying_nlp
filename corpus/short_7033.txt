Manu is a small time television actor who is craving for a break to make it into films. He encounters a stranger on his way to the shoot location. The ominous behavior of the stranger annoys Manu and he gets into an untoward duel on the road leading to the crash of the former. Next day morning he comes to know that the stranger on bike had then succumbed to the injuries. The film ends with a closer look on an unfortunate coincidence where the guilt conscious actor is having to deal with another death or rather a different death the very same day.
