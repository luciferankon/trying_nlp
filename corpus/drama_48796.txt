Documentary taking a fresh look at the murder of the medieval bishop and suggesting that established historical treatments of the killing fall short of explaining why Becket was murdered and on whose orders. Featuring powerful dramatisations and contributions from eminent scholars the film tells a compelling story of the battle between State and Church.
