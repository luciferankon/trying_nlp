All across America thousands of people who have been charged with a crime are out on the street. They're all waiting for their day in court but some aren't planning to show up. These fugitives are known as skips and more than 45000 skips are arrested every year. The men who track them down are called Skip Tracers. But most of us know them by another name - BOUNTY HUNTERS.
