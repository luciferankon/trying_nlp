He runs away from home at a young age and studies horticulture. After World War II he starts a nursery in a village in the province of Gelderland. At first he and Margje enjoy a happy family life and boundless love for one another. They also experience problems however with keeping the business going. One day Hans meets Jozef Mieras (Marcel Hensema) who talks to him about God. After Hans hears God's voice in a vision he becomes drawn ever deeper into his faith - a faith that will now determine the course of his life and that of his family. The rifts between the different family members become greater and greater until Hans is completely in the grip of the religious sect. Yet Margje's unconditional love for him survives in spite of all.
