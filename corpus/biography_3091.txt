Elmyr de Hory was called "The Myth of our Century" when he was revealed as a master forger in 1968. Born in 1905 he made an estimated 1000 fake paintings primarily in the style of the post-impressionists before he died - or disappeared - in 1976. In addition to faking paintings Elmyr de Hory often faked his own identity and traveled easily throughout Europe's high society.
