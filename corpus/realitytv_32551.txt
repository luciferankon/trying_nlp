Hosted by chefs 'Aarón Sánchez (II)' (qv) and 'Roger Mooking' (qv) Heat Seekers takes viewers on a tongue-testing odyssey to discover the most delicious and dangerous spicy food in the country and figure out why the smoking hot dishes are still so much fun to eat. Aarón and Roger travel to Miami Philadelphia New Orleans Santa Fe Chicago Seattle Charleston and Los Angeles in search of outrageously mouth-watering creations. In each city they discover the spicy secrets of everything from broiled crawfish and buffalo frog legs to fiery ribs and seafood ceviche and then subject themselves to a test of who can handle the heat.
