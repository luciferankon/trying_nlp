This film is a 1949 compilation from two films in the "McGuerin" streamliners series made by Hal Roach in 1942; "The McGuerins from Brooklyn" and "Taxi Mister" which accounts for players Lew Kelly Clyde Fillmore and Tyler Brooke being in a 1949 movie. The film opens with a clip from "The McGuerins From Brooklyn" in which Tim McGuerin and Eddie Corbett are being honored for growing their cab fleet from one in 1928 to a current 300. Lucy Gibbs asks Corbett how they got to this point and his explanation is a flashback to an edited version of "Taxi Mister" where Tim is romancing his future wife burlesque performer Sadie O'Brien whose obvious charms have also caught the eye of gangster Louis Glorio who is not too thrilled at the attention Tim is paying Sadie. Tim's romantic problems are solved when the police discover that Glorio is also the long-wanted and mysterious figure known as the Frisco Ghost. Fade back with a lot better editing than found in most compilations to "The McGuerins From Brooklyn" which has Sadie listening on the intercom suspecting that Tim and newly-hired secretary Lucy Gibbs are indulging in some hanky-panky in one of the most verbal-risque and double-entendre scenes ever to slip past the heavy-handed censors of that day. Corbett also has his own problems with a gold-digging Marcia Morrison that leads to all hands ending up at a health-spa resort ran by Mr. Samson whose attentions and intents toward Sadie in no way reflect those of some modern-day weight-reduction gurus.
