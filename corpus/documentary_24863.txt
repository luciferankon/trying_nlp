Writer and film maker Stuart Cresswell should be an advocate for wind energy. He has run countless marketing campaigns for wind energy products represented a former company at BWEA and UKWind Association events and to top it all his late father built a wind turbine at his home in 1949 - long before it was 'trendy'. Wind energy is in his blood. So why does the modern push for wind power leave a nasty taste in his mouth? Why does the almost overnight development of wind farms in Nova Scotia make him feel so uneasy? Stuart takes us on a journey of discovery as he struggles to find answers that satisfy him - but finds only more questions and issues in a fight that is increasingly polarized. Using interviews with experts on both sides supporters of wind farms and opponents he takes us across both sides of the Atlantic to trace the history of wind energy and takes us up close and personal with an offshore wind farm and flies over new wind farms in Nova Scotia. But this is an emotional and personal story - he uncovers some startling evidence about his recently deceased father and his early wind turbine.
