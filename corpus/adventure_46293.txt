On May 17th 2010 47 Teams of 4 set out on one of the most grueling journey's of a lifetime. This journey was to take them over 700 non-stop Kilometres comprising Mountain Biking Treking Cayaking White water Rafting and Orienteering. The teams get little or no sleep and have to take with them everything they need to eat and use along the way as there are no support crews.
