This short film takes viewers to the shores of Sable Island a small strip of land less than a mile-wide whose only full-time inhabitants are wild horses; no human attempts at colonization have ever succeeded. Director and Photographer Drew Doggett examines Sable through its never-ending cycles of birth and rebirth with a narrator who is anonymously-enmeshed within the island as its pervasive voice. Drew partnered with Christopher Ward a multi-platinum Oscar and Grammy-winning composer to create an original score for the film as well as Director of Photography Benny Nicks whose celebrated work has been shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. This short film takes viewers to Sable's shores through a narrator mysteriously enmeshed within the island to explore the never-ending cycles that make this strip of land a self-sustaining system where only wild horses have managed to thrive.
