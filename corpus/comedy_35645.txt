Sweety lives with her mom maternal grandpa and grandma. She is very rebelious emotional and high-strung and does not get along well with her classmates in school. The reason for this is that she does not know who her father is. All she knows is that she is not permitted to talk about him at home. She finds out that her dad is in Seychelles Nairobi South Africa and runs away there. When she gets to Nairobi she comes to know that her dad who she has been so anxious to meet is living with another woman Swati Sinha who is married to another male and her dad is not at all thrilled to have a teenaged daughter come and interrupt his life and affairs.
