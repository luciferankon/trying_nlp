Our American Days tells the story of life in Trieste during the Allied Military Government (1945-1954). The faces and stories of those who at the time were kids playing baseball in the outskirts of town of young women who found jobs mumbling a few words of English all drenched in the backdrop of the stars and stripes and Studebakers that cruised around the city. They are the voices of the protagonists of that era in a Trieste seen in black and white that suddenly after the war found itself catapulted among the colors of America and Swing.
