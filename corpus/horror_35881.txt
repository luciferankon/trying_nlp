A taste of immortality in "Beautiful Evil" as the Hollywood Hills are littered with the bodies of Sunset Strip prostitutes. The ladies of the night are found decapitated no remnants or traces of blood remain in their lifeless bodies. The LAPD are perplexed and Steve "Flash" Turner a down and out paparazzi photographer is hoping his luck is about to change when he captures Beverly Hills socialite Baroness Von Siepold at a star studded event. Flash gets the shot but the image of the Baroness does not transfer to the digital picture. No one will believe this sure shot photographer missed a photo-op as the body count continues to rise when the sun sets.
