Using a hot-air balloon to film sequences for _The Year of the Wildebeest (1975)_ (qv) Alan and Joan Root further explored its usefulness to film animals on the mountains and plains of East Africa in Balloon Safari. Highlight of the journey was the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Kilimanjaro. In the mid-1970s Alan Root brought the first hot-air balloon to Africa for filming purposes recognizing that airplanes were too fast to film animals adequately while the noise of the slower helicopters frightened them away. A visually-stunning and amusing film is Root's Balloon Safari made with his wife Joan they chronicle the arrival of the balloons as well as the tribulations of learning to fly them.
