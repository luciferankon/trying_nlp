Coming of age attempts to give a voice to those who make up the school to those who render it alive and who at times may suffer from it: the children. They are the main actors in this microcosm alongside the adult teachers who support them. The film gives the school back to the children. It places the camera at their level scrutinizing the looks gestures movements the dreams and desires of a class in a small school in Florence Pestalozzi City-School. It offers no comments judgments or interpretation from adults.
