As the MTV cable network shocked the TV world with it's success as a 24-hour music video channel the major broadcast networks soon tried to jump on the bandwagon to get their own share. ABC's entry in the fight was this program which ran late on Friday nights and featured such popular cotemporary artists as Prince John Cougar The Cars Huey Lewis and Cyndi Lauper. The program was not able to match MTV's success however and it lasted for only about a year.
