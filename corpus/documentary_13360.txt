The 'North Korea Freedom Week' events have been held every year since 2004 but have not garnered that much interest or awareness. There is much talk of the defectors doing a lot of work for reunification but in reality many do not how or what work the defector are doing. The purpose is to show through the documentary what effect the 12th North Korea Freedom Week has had both here and abroad. There was a desire to show what could be accomplished by the defectors who have been training and learning and preparing. There was a desire to show what we as a society must do first for reunification.
