A young woman heavily injured in a car accident is dying in Strakonice's maternal hospital. Her new born son is given by three Fates a faithful girlfriend and a talent for singing as a compensation for his life without parents. After years Jirka Svanda ('Karel Gott' (qv)) makes his living as a decorator he dates a loving Dorotka ('Jitka Molavcová' (qv)) but he sings only in the local wine bar U Dudáka. The Fates give him a worn out embroidered tail-coat for good luck. A photographer from a fashion magazine Kalenda ('Jirí Sovák' (qv)) invites Svanda who told him about his desire to sing professionally to Prague. Still before leaving Svanda substitutes a non-operating equipment and he sings for guests at a unique fivefold wedding which is covered by TV. Then he goes to Kalenda but first he is taken care of a by a cheater and a shark Vocílka ('Josef Somr' (qv)) who imposes himself on the naive Svanda as a manager.
