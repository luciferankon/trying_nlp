This documentary tackles the sensitive subject of Gipsy crime and the prejudice against the Roma minority and their limited presence in the Hungarian police force. We present three people all of Roma origins: SÃ¡ndor the young cop working in the crimeridden 8th district of Budapest; Misi a former police officer forced into early retirement; and Bea a young aspiring girl from the countryside who appeals to the Police Academy.
