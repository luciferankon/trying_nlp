One day people will realize that he was right and that he saw far ahead of everybody else. With these words Jacques Derridda described Gerardo Marotta modern Neapolitan Maecenas and President of the Istituto Italiano Studi Filosofici.The Avvocato Marotta is the protagonist of this portrait. He is a contemporary humanist that for over half a century struggles to disseminate Culture and education as a mean to achieve social justice.The idea of life as Resistance accompanied Gerardo Marotta throughout his life and induced him to sacrifice his private life and his wealth in the name of the Public Spirit in particular for the future generations.Today Gerardo Marotta the "Avvocato" is 85 years old and has a dream: to donate to the city and to the his collection of three hundred thousand books collected in his lifetime but that has not yet found an appropriate location in a public library. The film tells the story of a life full of passion of a forceful character that conducted many struggles and of his philosophical historical and political views as well of the City where all this takes place. He is a true fascinating storyteller with an innate sense for acting art practiced to perfection during his years as lawyer.
