Armani is the one born with the blood curse. She's remained hidden on earth since her birth. When her Guardian Karhl and BaSatai Warrior Rafael arrive to return her home where she can be better protected she is reminded of what she represents to them - death and sacrifice. The strong attraction Armani feels for Rafael complicates her rebellion against them and with her arch enemy determined to go after Rafael Armani finds herself jealous despite wanting nothing to do with him. She can continue to pretend to be human or acknowledge the BaSatai within her but is she accepts her identity everything will change. As supernaturals break down protective barriers on the hunt for her. She wants to remain with her adoptive father and pursue a safe human life while her animalistic BaSatai instincts need to be unleashed. An attack on Armani releases the scent of her spilled blood as an identifier and the threat deepens. When she is almost killed and Karhl becomes a fugitive that Armani snaps out of what she wants most and does what she needs to do - acknowledge her heritage. She races against time to save Karhl from judgment but how she finds him will change everything around.
