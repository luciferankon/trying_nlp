MAINSTREAM traces Hollywood's origins from the early art-driven movie moguls to the profit-driven corporations of today. With the government-decreed divestiture of movie theaters in 1948 the Golden Age of Hollywood was destroyed. Along with this destruction of the "studio system" movies became increasingly formulaic exploitative violent and produced by a small "control group" of insiders. Then with the advent of TV and various influences from Europe Hollywood movies descended into a morass of cultural Marxist-infested political correctness that gave birth to what we now know as the MAINSTREAM MEDIA. Governed by just 6 huge conglomerates Hollywood movies and the New York-based media have become involved with hundreds of predatory unethical and often times illegal business practices that result in discrimination against talents crews executives and whole populations. Worse the movies and network news have become a tool of the Globalist Agenda an agenda to outsource the U.S. manufacturing base in the name of "free trade" and destroy the American Middle Class in the name of "stockholder value." Liberal Hollywood has become one of the "big bad" corporations it endlessly dramatizes in its movies. And all this started as a consequence of government intervention into the right of the movie moguls to market their own movies in their own theaters.
