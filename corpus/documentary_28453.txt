January 19 2017 at midnight fifty-seven women met on a ranch outside Austin Texas for a thirty-hour bus ride to the Women's March on Washington. They returned to Texas at midnight on January 22. An unlikely group they were age 13 to 70; white Latina and black; CIS gendered and off the binary; rural and urban. Four were undocumented - one had spent 10 months in detention. They brought pillows blankets food and clothing for 3 days. Several crocheted pink hats on the way. Most had never been to a mass demonstration.
