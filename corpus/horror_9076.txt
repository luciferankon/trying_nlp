Insane asylums shallow graves and magick of the blackest kind. Maelstrom Productions' newest project is an updated but faithful adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's "The Thing on the Doorstep". Stephen King describes Lovecraft as "The 20th century horror story's dark and baroque prince". Shot entirely on Digital Video the film promises to satisfy fans of Lovecraft and the genre itself.
