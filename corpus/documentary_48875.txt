November 7th 2001. After a seventy years absence the Ecuadorian national soccer team is close to qualifying for the first time to a Soccer World Cup. This documentary follows the events that took place during that historic date when a whole country lived under the shadow of a soccer game. From a psychiatric hospital to a public jail from the soccer field at the stadium to a beach on the Pacific Ocean and from the streets of New York to the freeways of Miami Ecuador versus the rest of the world gathers the show and the emotion of a country willing to change all its frustrations by one single illusion: the goal.
