Handwritten notes from the filmmaker are superimposed over home movies. The narration describes the filmmaker's meditations on sexuality - at 20 when his mother asks him about his sexual orientation and at 13 when his father describes sex. The home movies are a mix of dogs cavorting at the beach his family on vacations and a muscular nude man jumping on a trampoline and diving into a pool.
