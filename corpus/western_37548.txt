Deacon Merrill (Ned Norton) a reformed bank robber owns a dude ranch in Arizona. He was left in charge of the loot from a robbery in which the rest of the gang was caught and jailed. Two members of the old gang Slim Griffith (Edward Biby) and Jimmy 'Gabby' Boggs (Eddie Davis) show up to claim the money. Slim kills Merrill and the blame is placed on ranch foreman Steve Madison (Edmund Cobb) fiancee of Merrill's daughter June (Edna Aslin). Gang leader Butch (Jack Cheatham) and his moll Trixie (Lois Glaze) also show up as ranch guests. Slim kidnaps June and heads for the border followed by Steve on "Black King" (the Horse With the Human Brain) followed by a posse after him. A rancher's daughter returns from college to marry her fiance the ranch foreman. However the foreman has gotten involved with gangsters who are now after him because he hid their stolen money and can't remember where.
