Written by Kathy Burke the premis of this shown is the inner thoughts and tribulations of a young teenage girl. With her best friend she kicks about the town idolising rock bands and chatting. The cameo by Kathy Burke as the nun is hilarious and the dialogue between the girls genius. Another gold star for the little cracker series on sky 1. Brilliant stuff
