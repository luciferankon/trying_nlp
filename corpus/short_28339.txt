ORA is a stunning meeting between the artistic worlds of choreographer Jos√© Navas and filmmaker Philippe Baylaucq. It is the first film to use 3D thermal imaging producing visuals like none that have ever been seen before: the luminous variations of body heat seen on skin bodies emitting a multitude of colours a space filled with movement that transforms itself.
