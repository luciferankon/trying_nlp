The problems that confront the remote communities on the Tiwi Islands of the Torres Strait are similar to those that confront young people everywhere - but isolation and a lack of things to do make the young people of these communities particularly vulnerable to crime and substance abuse. The "strong men" of the community is a group determined to solve the problem themselves by offering positive role models and beneficial activities to the young people. In this documentary we see these leaders take young people away from the township to experience traditional hunting and living and to hear the stories of their elders.
