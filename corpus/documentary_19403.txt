A documentary about the music and life since the beginnings in 1975 of the one and only Central European music group which has made an international career the favourite band of Iggy Pop and Henry Rollins: The Galloping Coroners (Die Rasenden Leichenbeschauer Vágtázó Halottkémek). The scandalous and "banned for more than 11 years" band is not only the most prominent of those Central European bands which revolted against the communist system but also a theatre which gained the attention of the audience with its unique body-art performances. Through the story of the favourite underground band of the Hungarian and international media we can see the aesthetic preferences of the late Central European socialist system and the altering system which followed it.
