Maddy shows an example of the hurt and blame that a person can put on themselves instead of finding healing and forgiveness from the Lord. The blame that the character Maddy has put on herself for the accidental death of her parents puts her on the street. Literally Maddy is burdened with guilt and feels that she does not deserve to have anything and decides to give it all away. On the streets she is loved by fellow homeless men and woman and is known to be the giver and the protector. Her grieving heart may be broken but it hadn't left her. Throughout this DVD you witness how different peoples lives can be. Some have an abundance and some have nothing. But one of the points taken away from this family DVD is that no matter where you are in life or what you have you always need Jesus. Several characters in this DVD exhibit the need and most of them encounter someone who wants to share the Gospel and the love of Jesus Christ. So it's through time and trial that several of the character's hearts begin to change toward Jesus. Maddy the most generous of all of the characters comes to have peace with God and receives His forgiveness and changes her life for Him. God also blesses her with more than just His love and grace He blesses her with someone whom she has had heartache for her entire life- a brother whom she thought had been dead the entire time!
