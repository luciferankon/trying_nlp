Daniel is different. Obsessed with comics he spends his time either pouring over their pages or fantasizing that he lives within one. It is there in his own mind that he fantasizes of saving the day getting the girl and reveling in the glory. But his reality is a far cry from heroic and after he is pushed too far he decides that it is time that he made his comic book fantasies... a reality.
