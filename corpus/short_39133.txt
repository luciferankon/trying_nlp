On September 11 2001 eight American children lost their lives because of an act of terrorism. Since that day approximately eight thousand children of Afghanistan and Iraq have lost their lives as a result of war. Dale Clark an 83 year old artist and activist from Bisbee Arizona respectfully remembers all of these children. With his Children's Memorial 'Have Coffin Will Travel' he hitchhikes with a coffin to bring attention to these children. While hitchhiking and pushing the coffin through town he makes himself vulnerable to stimulate dialog and inspire faith in humanity.
