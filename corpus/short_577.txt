Too Many Ghosts is a fictionalised commentary on the folly of war. It is set in Europe between the last five days of the Second World War and a few days after the end of hostilities. Joe Franklin a young corporal in Britain's illustrious 350-year-old East Yorkshire Regiment is reminiscing about the horrors of war and the mental scars it inflicts on the physically and mentally injured. He is filled with remorse at the memories of those very close to his heart who have perished. Many are missing but some have been returned home to be buried in towns and villages up and down the British Isles. Joe's story is told against the musical backdrop of England's great national composer Sir Edward Elgar (1857-1934) Master of the King's Musick with poetry by some of the country's great war poets including Rupert Brooke and Laurence Binyon and specially-composed verse by the film-maker.
