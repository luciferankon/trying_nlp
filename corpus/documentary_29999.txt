Interviewing Chicagoans in Casablanca and Casablancans in Chicago filmmaker Richard Martini digs into the differences between the cultures as well as the amazing similarities. Also interviews with a female judge a female member of Parliament in Morocco as well as a female soybean trader at The Chicago Board of Trade highlight the similarities we don't normally see or pay attention to. The hour long documentary is narrated by Sally Kellerman
