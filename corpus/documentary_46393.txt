These two female singers from New York City who also play piano and electric guitar full of reverb cross the Atlantic this time around with their own band. So it's very likely that their "urban folk" will be even more compact infectious and soulful than ever before. Their last album released on the Klangbad label got rave reviews around the globe - with NME giving it four points out of five. It could well be a foretaste of what we can expect live: heart-warming songs celebrating close harmony create a wonderful mood - only interrupted now and again by gruff punk-interludes that arrive just in time to rescue things from becoming too celebratory. The concert was filmed for the "play loud! (live) music series".
