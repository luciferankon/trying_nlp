Host of Hidden Heritage Paul LaRoche shares inspiring and uplifting stories that come from his personal journey into Native America. As founder of the award-winning contemporary Native American group Brul√© and AIRO (American Indian Rock Opera) Paul and his family have traveled across the heartland performing their unique blend of music for 12 years. Show topics for Hidden Heritage are gathered from their own experiences as they reconnected with Paul's blood family from the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and met indigenous people from all walks of life. The episodes cover a variety of themes - some with humor some with important historical elements and some with musical components - whether told from the simple setting of their backyard fire pit or the grandness of America's majestic Mount Rushmore National Monument.
