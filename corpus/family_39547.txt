In the village cemetery the funeral of a married couple - victims of a car crash - is ending. The relatives unscrupulously take away the facilities of the dead people's little cottage totally ignorant of the fate of eight-year old Ruda ('Josef Filip' (qv)) whom the childless couple took from a children's home and adopted. Fortunately an elderly lonesome uncle named Tony ('Ludovít Króner' (qv)) remains in the empty cottage and decides to take care of the boy nicknamed Münchie after Baron Münchhausen for his wild imagination.
