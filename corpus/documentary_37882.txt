This is a 4 pieces documentary that follow 4 different contemporary composers performing/creating/building theirs shows. Peter Greenaway lead us with a great sense of balance between the performances and the interviews through the creative process of 4 very different composers in style (sound and noise repetition and discipline vocal experimentation poetry and musical freedom) who are all framed under the same musical genre. Contemporary music. Great way to get introduce to this music and get to understand how much of it it's intelectual or playful.
