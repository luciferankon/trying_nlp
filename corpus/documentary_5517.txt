This is a story about a man who risked his life to save his culture his heritage his language. He is now grandfather to my children and like many immigrants whose children and grandchildren do not embrace or even learn their mother tongue he is heart broken that the sacrifices made to save his language are not appreciated or understood by the younger generation. This is a common story for many immigrants. We are lost in translation.
