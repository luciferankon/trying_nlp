Bradley Gibb had it all. A beautiful wife a palatial home in the suburbs and a great job hosting the most popular talk show on television - The Hot Seat with Bradley Gibb. Then one day all hell broke loose. His wife Boodle is suddenly possessed by a demon and it looks like he might lose her altogether. At the instructions of the archdiocese's exorcist Father Francis Flanagan he ties her to their bed and waits for his arrival. Ever the opportunist Bradley decides that this would be an excellent opportunity to film an actual exorcism for his show. Surely his wife the show's director would agree wouldn't she? Unfortunately he can't ask her in her current condition so he makes the decision for her. He calls in his main cameraman Pat Lor for the historic taping. At first outraged by this turn of events Father Flanagan reluctantly agrees to allow the cameraman into the bedroom to record the sacred rite of exorcism. But when Bradley and Pat encounter the demon in his lucid state for the first time a new opportunity emerges. An interview with a demon! As a negotiation to voluntarily leave the body of Boodle the Demon consents to the television interview but first he must enter the body of a new host. He explains that when a host is willing there is no danger and so convinces Pat to be his new body. What follows is a wild ride as the Demon explains demystifies and reveals the truth about life on the other side.
