Bobby Ray Summers is a 30-year-old unmarried janitor with more on his mind than mops. Sure he's a total loser who lives with his parents but he also makes the most of his ample spare time by kidnapping sexy young librarians and tying lonely housewives to trees. Oh he also likes Mozart art museums and torturing small birds and rodents. Through interviews with Ray's family his victims and delightfully cheesy re-enactments we're given the truth the whole truth and nothing but. In the end "Crime Scene: The Bobby Ray Summers Story" is a Python-esque view of American criminal justice at its most hilarious.
