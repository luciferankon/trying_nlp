This interesting picture shows a small guard of colored soldiers being put through a drill and the fine showing that they make is indeed commendable. One feature of their manoeuvres is the clever way in which they scale a high wall. It shows how easy and with what agility the men in time of trouble could conquer a fort or scale a high wall in escaping the enemy.
