We meet three men who build and play with RC-cars in their spare time on a abandoned field near the harbor. What unites these men is the joy of being a child again although not all men seem to agree on this entirely. On one thing they do agree on: their cars are a serious piece of engineering and definitely not a child's toy to them. Men of the Racetrack is a humorous documentary about the love pride and dedication that goes into the manly hobby called driving with radio controlled cars.
