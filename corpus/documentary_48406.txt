This is one of Palestine's earliest sound films and part of a larger campaign to encourage settlement and investment in "the Jewish homeland." Land of Promise emphasizes secular accomplishments and portrays Zionist settlers with considerable cinematographic and editorial skill. Punctuated by evocative close-ups this part-documentary part-travelogue part-message film shows Palestine as a land of opportunity the place for fulfilling an ancient dream. Preserved by and made available in cooperation with the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House.
