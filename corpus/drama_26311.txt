This is the story of Henning Becker (28) a Danish journalist who went to Vietnam in 1970 with nothing but a typewriter and his curiosity. When he left a few years later it was in the most dramatic way anybody could imagine on one of the last planes out of a burning Saigon. He was now a father of 45 children and a primary caretaker of another 159. All 204 was on board the plane with him on their way to safety in his native country Denmark where an entirely other battle started.
