The Commander Tom Show was a Buffalo New York market show--outside airings were very seldom. It consisted of interstitial segments with Tom Jolls--the host of the show and also a Buffalo New York weatherman--shown around episodes of the Adventures of Superman (TV Series 1952-1958). Dustmop the puppet (a dog) was introduced in 1967. An alligator puppet Matty the Mod followed along with the first female puppet Cecily Fripp modeled after American comedian Phyllis Diller. After its cancellation in 1991 the show essentially merged with another Buffalo market show Rocketship 7 (TV Series 1962-1993) until its own cancellation in 1993.
