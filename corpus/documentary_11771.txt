This feature documentary was produced over a period of 24 years from the war's first shots to the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Dayton Accords which ended the fighting. It is a cinematic essay told through the experiences of five people who survived death and horror and have struggled since then to rebuild their city and their lives.
