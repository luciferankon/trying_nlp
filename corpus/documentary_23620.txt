A Fragile Dream is an intimate first hand portrayal of Rio de Janeiro's volatile favelas and how football is used as a moral and educational tool to provide stability to the lives of hopeful adolescents. Often poignant and ultimately uplifting the film details the stories and motivations of those who represent each stage of this dream - from the children hoping to make the grade as professional footballers to former national team icons such as Jorginho and Josimar. Based around a series of interviews and with rare access to the favelas A Fragile Dream gives the viewer an opportunity to see behind the scenes of Brazil's most competitive industry. Narrated by award winning actor Peter Capaldi A Fragile Dream underlines how the beautiful game forms such a fundamental part of Rio's culture and identity. And while football cannot always provide a financial escape route for the thousands of young hopefuls attempting to become Brazil's next big star it can be used as a means to keep these children away from the temptations and everyday violence of the drug gangs.
