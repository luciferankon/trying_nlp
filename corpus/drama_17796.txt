WHATEVER is about the real lives of teens - the challenges the joys the conflict the heartbreak. For so long teen life has been portrayed as petty and unimportant or the world paints a smiley face on teen issues when we all know that there's so much more going on under the surface. There is incredible fun and fear happiness and sadness feeling like you belong and feeling like you are all alone. Add in drugs alcohol relationships parents teachers friends enemies and everything else we deal with EACH day - and you have WHATEVER.
