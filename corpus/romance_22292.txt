Elaine Rose Chalmers has the perfect organized life. The host of her own Austin Texas radio program the self-proclaimed "Queen of Planning" spends her days advising callers on how charts lists and graphs can insure a peaceful successful life and what results they can expect. But what she doesn't expect is the result of one very disorganized evening back home in the little town of McIntosh Florida. It seems that one recent "very hard to remember evening" with Billy Joe Crawley her high school sweetheart has changed a few things on Elaine's list. And now... she's unexpectedly expecting! A baby hadn't made her 2-year plan; she'd barely penciled it in at the bottom of the 5-yr goal sheet. And a one-night stand with a childhood friend hadn't exactly been on her to-do list either! Join Elaine Billy Joe and a host of city people and bunch of good ol√© southern folk as we watch how they deal with the one thing we all know is guaranteed in this life - change! Now it seems that for Elaine Rose Chalmers host of Austin's #1 radio show "Charmed with Chalmers" an unexpected pregnancy forces her to learn that sometimes the best plan is not having a plan at all.
