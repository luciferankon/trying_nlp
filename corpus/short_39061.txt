In a modern-day twist on the classic fable "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" Hillside Office Systems worker Shepherd finds himself utterly bored with his mundane job. When the current office manager Jenkins announces her imminent departure - and inaugurates a competition to replace her to be judged by her superior Darrow - Shepherd instead concocts a series of pranks designed to rankle his coworkers. His tales verge on the outlandish - an escaped Red Panda a police arrest of a Hollywood celebrity - but his trusting coworkers all go along with his entreaties - until the one time when he truly needs their trust.
