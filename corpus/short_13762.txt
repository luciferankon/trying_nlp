In this series of three short films Hobart Bell adapted three passages from the writings of contemporary American poet Kenneth Patchen for dramatic interpretation by three actors. Rather than enacted on a stage or set however each of the three passages as voice overlays merges with a visual exploration of three surreal lithographs collectively entitled Les Femmes by the German artist Paul Wunderlich. The visions of Patchen and Wunderlich are bridged by chamber music of the contemporary American composer Charles Eakin. Narrative poetry art and music converge and diverge by chance and by design and the viewer will know the one or the other more by his or her perceptive insights into the montage than by any statement the filmmaker overtly projects.
