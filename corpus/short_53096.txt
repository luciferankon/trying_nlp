This piece is divided into three segments: "Gun Training" (2:43) "Haitian Hotel Camera Blocking" (2:54) and "Mojo Race" (4:25). Each of these shows video footage from the various settings. In "Training" we watch the actors learn how to handle their weapons while "Blocking" offers shots of Mann as he works to figure out how he'll shoot a specific scene. Finally "Race" gives us remarks from Beebe supervising art director Seth Reed and key grip Scott Robinson. They discuss the camera boat used for that sequence and then we watch it be filmed. All three provide some nice glimpses at the various aspects of the shoot.
