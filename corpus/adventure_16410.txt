Two separate stories populate this bondage tale. In the first Lady Larceny a former crook gone straight attempts to one-up her heroic boyfriend by rescuing a bevy of supermodels from a sinister white-slaver. L.L. manages to rescue the captives but can't escape herself and is subjected to severe punishment before she is sold to the highest bidder. In the second yarn a buxom businesswoman is lured into a trap by a rival spirited to a remote hideout and trained for her new job as a bondage slave.
