Created by 3 young people an Australian radio station RAW FM provides a voice for a large and incredibly diverse group of teenagers often ignored by mainstream media. RAW FM not only offers them something totally different from anything they've ever heard on the airwaves before but also the chance to participate. And RAW FM lives up to its name. It's loud anarchic energetic spontaneous. It's totally raw. Or it is in the beginning. RAW takes off so much that it starts to take over. It gets BIG. And with this success comes the price. Can RAW be the hottest thing on the radio dial while still being the coolest?
