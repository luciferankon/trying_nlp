How far can you go when you fight for the right cause? Does the perspective of the greater good justify kidnapping violence or even murder? Four naive eco-activists are drawn into a cascade of increasing violence when trying to save the coast of Normandy from a nuclear pollution hazard. 4 young environmental activists campaign for ecological awareness. Pictures of their radical protest spread all over the news while the group's attention is already drawn to a new scandal: a sunken ship containing radioactive waste in a Normandy bay area home of activist In√©s. Her fight for the environment now becomes a fight for her family's lives. What the crew needs to salvage the ship are the exact coordinates and a great amount of money. The only way to get these: kidnapping the people in charge of sinking the ship. But can you succeed as a kidnapper without the right know-how? LOOK4THEM represents a young flexible generation ready to face the world's problems with -maybe- naive but courageous approaches.
