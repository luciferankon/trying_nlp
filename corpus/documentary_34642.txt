This film shows how a pile of earth dug out from the building site is turned into a small house called Eco- Dome (moon cocoon model) using the Superadobe technology. It documents how professionals and students from many countries training at Cal-Earth Institute built this structure. It is intended for use with materials and tools developed for instruction during the apprenticeship retreat at Cal-Earth. Superadobe technology was first presented by the architect to NASA for lunar habitats and can build single or clustered homes on earth which are resistant to fire floods wind storms and earthquakes.
