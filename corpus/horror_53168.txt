In the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere.. A group of party-hungry nursing students stumble upon a bloodied and battered woman named Sammi in an alley. Going against their better judgment they decide to take her back to their sorority house for medical attention. They soon realize however that this isn't a harmless stray. Sammi is on the run from a vampire cult led by the murderous Rachel. And tonight Rachel wants Sammi back...In a bloody way.
