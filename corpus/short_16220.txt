In 1951 James Baldwin pays a visit to a remote village in the Swiss Alps: Leukerbad / Loƒçche-les-Bains. Baldwin is the first black person who stumbles into this village and reflects on this situation in an essay called "Stranger in the Village". Excerpts from this essay and a film score composed by Nils Petter Molvaer make up the audio part while the visual part gathers footage entirely shot in 2013. The question that the audience should be asking is: Did the world really change that much in the last 60 years?
