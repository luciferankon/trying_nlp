OCCUPY THE FARM tells the story of a community's fight to save public land for urban farming. When 200 farmers march to the gates of the last farmland in the urban East Bay near Oakland they don't carry signs protesting University of California's plans to build a shopping center. Instead they carry tents tools and 15000 seedlings. They clip the padlock off the gate and march onto the fields. What happens next will change the fate of the land and introduce a new strategy for activism. From tilling soil and watering vegetables to police raids from lawsuits to overflowing harvests OCCUPY THE FARM reveals a resourceful creative and determined community responding with direct action to a serious social need: access to healthy food.
