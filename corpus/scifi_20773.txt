Fifteen years after the destruction of the USS Equinox (approximate star date 2393) Captain Rudy Ransom who was beamed from his doomed ship by the Krotownans is held prisoner in the Delta quadrant for crimes against the race including trespassing in Krowtownan space and the deaths of Krowtown Crew members. Captain Ransom has very few choices but one chance to return to the Alpha Quadrant some 30.000 light years away.
