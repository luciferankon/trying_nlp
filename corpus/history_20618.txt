Based on a true story a group of WWII veterans decide to sail their former ship an LST (Landing Ship Tank) home to America in order to turn it into a memorial. They get permission from the US Congress; however when they arrive in Greece where the ship has been kept all these years they find the LST in disrepair. The old men have to work through their personal differences in order to fix the ship and bring it home.
