In a lucid dream there is a pair of joined islands above the sea horizon. Ocean tide rises mildly when a sacred three-legged raven lands on the shore then there follows the man in kendo armor. The man wakes up with a heavy headache in an abandoned attic upon the city center. He wonders whether he was then dreaming of a raven by the shore or whether he is now the raven dreaming he is an obsolescent warrior trapped in a busy metropolis.
