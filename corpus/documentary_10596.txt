Set in New York City the epicenter of a phenomenon cropping up in communities across the United States "Nursery University" reveals the oddly competitive process of nursery school admissions. The film tells the story of five families - each with different backgrounds and economic circumstances - attempting to place their toddlers in preschool classrooms that have limited spaces and thus high price tags. "Nursery University" follows the families' journeys and the school directors who must determine which "applicants" to allow through their doors.
