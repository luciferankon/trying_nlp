A talented card player Chai Foon-Cheung (Bobby Au-yeung) entered a worldwide poker tournament when he was 18 years old and was regarded as a favorite. However due to the follies of youth Cheung was seduced by Lam Siu-Yan (Florence Kwok) who was his rival competitor Kiu Ching-Chor's (Michael Miu) girlfriend. Due to the distraction Cheung also became separated from his three-year-old younger brother. In the final tournament Cheung could not concentrate on his game and forfeited the competition.
