NARI brings us into the schools villages and homes of girls and women in modern India and invites us to hear their stories in their own words. The film travels from remote tribal hamlets without running water or electricity to affluent suburban neighborhoods and the crowded back alleys of metropolitan slums weaving together interviews with over forty women from different social strata. The piece is anchored by the filmmaker's own mother a journalist who focused on child labor and women's issues twenty years ago and grandmother and expands out to speak with farmers maids businesswomen students feminist writers and more.
