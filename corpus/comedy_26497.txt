Don't Look Now is an American national children's sketch comedy show produced for PBS by WGBH-TV in Boston Massachusetts and created by Roger Damon Price and Geoffrey Darby. It is a clone of their program for CJOHTV and Nickelodeon You Can't Do That on Television. The first episode aired on October 2 1983 and showed its final episode on October 30 1983. It was originally slated to be called Don't Tell Your Mother but was later changed to its current title Don't Look Now due to the PBS executives concern that the title may encourage children to keep secrets from their parents. It was created out of uncertainty that their top show You Can't Do That on Television would continue and was cancelled possibly due to the complaints of parents for its content and also Nickelodeon's concern that if had it not been cancelled it may have spelled the end of You Can't Do That on Television.
