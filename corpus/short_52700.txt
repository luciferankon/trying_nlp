His world is the confines of his small village and the gas station house where tends to his "only friend"; a precious orchid plant a "Palumbina". His life takes a twist when a group of big city hooligans goes out on a trip to shake up the countryside. As the gas station clerk falls for the leader of the pack's girl the twist takes a twist and it remains to be seen who's shaking up whom.
