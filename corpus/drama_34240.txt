In 1985 the Number 9 bus of the City Line Transportation System slammed into the North Highway Bus Stop killing six people. The stop was abandoned and the Number 9 was decommissioned.

Four strangers each dealing with a traumatic vent from their past meet on the bus after a long day. Their tired and ready for home. But sometimes the way home is the longest trip of all.
