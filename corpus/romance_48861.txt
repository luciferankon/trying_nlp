The story centers around a couple who announce their engagement and then find their relationship turning to shit within 24 hours. Meanwhile their family and friends - all of whom are engaged in far less conventional relationships - are doing just fine thank you. Eventually the couple finds a new way to sit next to one another - and perhaps to be together after all.
