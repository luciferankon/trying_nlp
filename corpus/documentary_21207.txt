In 2002 American photographer Tierney Gearon (1963- ) fresh from the disconcerting success of her 2001 exhibit at London's Saatchi Gallery goes to upstate New York to begin a project photographing her mother. Over the next few years two filmmakers record Gearon's visits accompanied by her two young children and later a baby. Gearon's mother can behave erratically and the presence of mother daughter and children brings up Gearon's own feelings about her childhood. Her children are philosophical about being photographed and on exhibition. Portraits of family discovery and healing may emerge.
