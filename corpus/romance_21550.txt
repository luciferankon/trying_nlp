Summer is a dark romance of a girl becoming a woman. Based on Edith Wharton's most erotic and lyrical novel the setting is a remote New England hilltown before the First World War. Summer is a story of sexual awakening and the journey from desire to love. It is told through the eyes of Charity Royall - an orphan "brought down from the mountain". Charity lives alone with Lawyer Royall - older alcoholic and obsessed with her beauty. Now she is twenty and hungry for what lies beyond her job in the dusty village library. Enter Lucius Harney a young architect from a different world. Charity's wary passage to adulthood unfolds in her ambiguous relationship with Royall and the blossoming dream she shares with Lucius. The turning point comes among the crowds and fireworks of a feverish 4th of July celebration. Encompassing all is the cycling backdrop of New England seasons - spring into summer fall into winter. Summer ends so that it will come again.
