This feature length silent film offers a fresh approach to film-making as a personal and philosophical discipline rendering images as insights and music as an auditory fountain bursting with meaning. Shut The Mouth is about a vow of silence elusive philosophical realities and the inner turmoil all of us will face as we find our way forward. It's also a contemplative film drawing the viewer into its depths while refusing easy answers.
