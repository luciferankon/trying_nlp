Michael Yusko a gambling addict with a drinking problem crowdsources funds to make a movie about a gambling addict with a drinking problem only to lose the money gambling. After a death threat from an ornery investor he is forced to make something with the miniscule funds he has left. It's difficult to say what comes next. We follow Michael everywhere changing modes from video-diarist to director to actor to something like a regular person. Are we watching a documentary about the making of the rump of his would-be film? Or is this that film? Is it both? Not even the characters (actors? subjects?) are sure. Frenetically edited and paced to the vicissitudes of Michael's temperamental and downright bizarre desires we are pulled deeper and deeper into a meta (non)narrative best described as a delightfully brutal portrait of artistic frustration.
