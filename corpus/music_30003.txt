Not until 1855 did Verdi have a chance to try his hand at the genre of French grand opera. A setting of a libretto by Eugčne Scribe Les Vępres siciliennes proved a success in Paris despite the problematical nature of its subject matter which deals with the Sicilian uprising against occupying French forces in Palermo in 1282. Today the opera is usually given in the Italian version of 1861 as I Vespri siciliani.
