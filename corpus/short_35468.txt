Luca is a lonely boy. He likes to go at night to swim in a pool when there is no one and only silence remains to keep him company. Everything goes quiet until a Monday an unknown swimmer named Mia breaks into his own little world. Without either of them being aware Monday become a regular event for these young lonely souls who look after look slowly begin to know each other. That place becomes their small but perfect world where the water and the night become silent spectators until such time as Mia as she arrived from nowhere suddenly disappears. Only at the end we realize that the place where the water is mixed with other water is a place that everyone at least once in our lives we visited.
