Zion is the history of the first sionist congress in Basle and Theodore Harzel's first suggestion of the foundation and form of an eventual Jewish State. It is also the story of Amos Gitai's mother who was born in Hiafa in 1909 and his father Munio Wenraub who left Berlin in 1993 via Basle. It's a journy from Basle to Jerusalem from Vienna to Haifa from 1897 to the present day.
