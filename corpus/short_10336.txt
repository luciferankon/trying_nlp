Spoken in 12 languages 'The Telephone Eulogies' is a living experiment on film that combines a children's game of broken telephone a self-penned eulogy and a trans-cultural cast of translators performers and language enthusiasts. The film follows the eulogic narrative as it snakes its way through 12 languages and 21 translations ultimately shedding layers of the original message as it is transformed by miscommunication misunderstanding mis-perception and misnomer. Ultimately the message suffers a slow death by interpretation while continually giving birth to new possible meanings.
