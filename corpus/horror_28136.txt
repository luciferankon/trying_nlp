After a number of children go missing in the small mountain town of Kiatshiobara Mei Kanemoto of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police is called in to assist in the case. Many of the locals believe that the children have been kidnapped by the mythical tengu a demonic bird of prey in preparation for a ritual performed at a passing comet. According to the older villagers a similar pattern of child abductions occurred almost thirty years ago - precisely when the comet last appeared in the sky. At first the detective dismisses these claims as nothing more than rural fairy tales. But after peeling back the layers on the surface of this seemingly innocent town it becomes clear that anything is possible in Kitashiobara.
