Have You Heard About The Ainu? Elders of Japan's Indigenous People Speak A documentary film by Dr. Kinko Ito Professor of Sociology University of Arkansas at Little Rock This film is based on my ethnographic research in Hokkaido Japan. The Ainu are an indigenous ethnic minority people of Japan who have their own language and unique culture. Their ancestors lived in northern part of Honshu Hokkaido Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. Since the establishment of the Hokkaido Colonization Board by the Japanese government in the late 19th century the Ainu's homeland (Ainu Moshir) became national land. They were exposed to various assimilation policies including ethnic cleansing. They have been prejudiced and discriminated against and they had to cope with "the problem" at school at work and in marriage. In 2014 I went to Hokkaido stayed with an Ainu family and videotaped several elderly Ainu men and women talk about their lives in their own words: their youth identity socialization poverty work marriage and family going to war prejudice discrimination and cultural heritage among other interesting topics. The Ainu elders shared with me their unique experiences as an ethnic minority of Japan. In spite of their hardships in the past all of them say that they are happy and content. They are the leading light for the young Japanese who are suffering from bullying depression anxiety and loss of hope in contemporary Japan.
