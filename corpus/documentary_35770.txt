Made entirely with a cell phone camera too close too far is an exploration of Brooklyn's 'boroughscapes' and a critique of urban renewal. Much of the movie was made secretly while searching for an apartment; the cell phone camera artifacts reflect a technologically-advanced but economically troubled society. An homage to dust displacement and transience the movie includes a soundtrack by Esmerine.
