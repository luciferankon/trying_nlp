The Result Achieved by Knowing God One day you'll feel the Creator's no more a riddle He's never been hidden never covered His face from you; He's not far from you at all; He's no longer the One you yearn for day and night but can't reach with your feelings. He is genuinely standing guard around your side supplying your life and controlling your fate. He's not on the distant horizon nor is He hidden in the clouds. He is right by your side reigning over your all. He's your everything and your only One. A God as such makes you adore Him admire Him cling to Him hold Him close whom you fear to lose no longer want to turn your back on and disobey or avoid and distance from; you just want to care for Him obey Him repay all He gives you submit to His dominion. You no longer refuse His guidance supply care and protection; you don't resist His sovereignty and arrangement any more. You just want to follow Him be with Him; you just want to accept Him as your one and only life as your one and only Lord and God. from Preface to Continuation of The Word Appears in the Flesh.
