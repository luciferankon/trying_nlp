Ted Darman is the construction foreman for the Continental Gold Dredging Co. and falls in love with Dora Wade the daughter of the leader of a farmers' group that opposes the dredging because they believe it is destroying their land. Ted and Dora come up with what they believe is a machine that can resoil the land as he dredge digs it and they convince the farmers to mortgage their farms in order to build it. However a company agent who has money invested in the dredging operation causes the new machine to be wrecked. Complications ensue.
