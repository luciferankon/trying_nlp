In their impressive mansion they start by sharing the luxurious bathroom and adjoining dressing room to try on different pieces of flimsy lingerie from their mother's wardrobe - without losing their high heels. Isabelle goes out and is followed by a foreign young man with whom she accepts a promenade through the park in his car. He stops in a secluded parking lot where he explores unashamedly all of her body. Despite her initial resistance Isabelle is overcome with lust and ends up by making oral sex to him. She sets a date for that night at her place and Nicolas ('PIOTR STANISLAS') is punctual. When Isabelle and Nicolas re-start their love making on the library's couch Marilyn suddenly interrupts them her red dress reflecting her feelings for her sister doing a man behind her back. An argument leads to a punching scratching biting stripping sisterly fight. Eventually their fighting lust will be calmed by Nicolas passion aroused by this pair of nice bad girls.
