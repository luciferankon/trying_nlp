Keyboard legend Keith Emerson emerged from the thriving rock scene of the sixties and seventiesFusing rock 'n' roll with classical jazz and world music to lay the foundations of progressive rocksetting the standard by which others are judged. With Greg Lake and Carl Palmer he formed the hugely successful Emerson Lake and Palmer who between 1970 and 1977 released six platinum albums. This is his official documentary of his extended autobiography with interviews featuring many of the characters from his published autobiography and more as he does what he loves most living his life through his music. Now in this insightful and irreverent memoirfrom his classmates to his music teacher to fellow band members and roadies we hear about the uproarious tales of life on the road tales of the high lifestyle that goes with being a rock star and of course tales of the outrageous barrier-shattering music he is still producing.This is the show that never ends as he re-kindles the past and adds to the future with his creative and groundbreaking music including the 40th ELP Re-union in London UK July 2010.
