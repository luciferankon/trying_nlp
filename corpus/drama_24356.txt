This is the story of Toribio Sosa a police officer doing everything at his reach to get the necessary money so that his wife survives a postpartum leukemia. With a monthly salary of 7000 pesos it's impossible to reach his goal and that's when he decides to use his only resources at hand: his regulation weapon and the underworld. Lack of education poverty absence of an adequate health system and the shameless way politicians rub on the face of millions of citizens like Toribio that they could steal public money and jokingly evade the highest judicial instances to get away with it had triggered in Toribio an irreversible process. The birth of a monster that like the Paleolitical men would leave his cave to fight a mammoth or a bison no matter how bigger or more powerful it was with the only purpose of survival and well-being of his people. Toribio is the "bad guy" of this story and with it we don't intend to justify or apologize crime - But heck the line's so thin.
