A buddy comedy about four best friends who plot and scheme mayhem with and against each other to make their lives fun and interesting. No one is safe from the other while no topic or property is either. These guys are relentless in their verbal and physical assaults to one up the next guy or hand out a little taste of revenge. Boys will be boys with a few ladies and trash talk in the mix.
