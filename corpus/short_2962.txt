A short film produced for the National Consumer Finance Association with the purpose of educating high school and college students on debt loans and how much additional debt should be taken on given net income less fixed expenses and other necessities. It centers on a conservative stuffy business-like character named "Mr. Money" and his explaining of debt to two students. Very campy and naive so much so that it is featured as comic relief in excerpts and in its entirety as a special feature in the DVD release of the 2006 documentary "Maxed Out" which deals with the predatory lending practices of credit card companies and their sponsorship of the recent anti-consumer changes in bankruptcy law.
