In this provocative and gritty  ensemble piece we explore the destroyed worlds of four lovers. The film starts in a tacky  Vegas chapel with Steven Bill Kerry and  Katie thinking about their failed relationships. They each reflect on their recent past and  how each came to be married in the chapel.  Their four marriages came about during  fragile moments of desperation and need. As  we reflect back on the four gut wrenching stories of love violence laughter and  heartache we are eventually brought to the  present day and the reality that each well  painted story is still unresolved.  Steven is the "wannabe" rocker. Bill is the  fragile X marine. Kerry is the struggling  mother with a handicapped son. Katie is the  hippie drifter nomading around the country.  The final resolution will leave them facing the  cold fact that love can be harsh and life  marches forward irrespective of their broken  lives. These four enticing stories leave us  moved by the stark emotions of their Indigo  Hearts.
