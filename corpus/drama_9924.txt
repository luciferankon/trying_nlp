The beginning of the 20th century. A village in the mountain. The young barrel maker Liyu is to be examined by the local craftsmen. They approve the barrel he has made blindfold. They give him "the craftsman's belt". At the beginning nobody considers him a master. One day Karata a mountain dweller from the neighboring Muslim village orders him a cheese barrel. Soon Liyu takes the barrel to the Karata's village. The latter likes it but one envious man says that the barrel is not good since its rings are made of wood. While Liyu explains that the wood rings are stronger than the metal ones if a true master makes them all the peasants gather. In the middle of a quarrel the Imam comes. He says that the rings will not hold. Liyu offers a bet - he will roll his barrel down a steep hill and if it does not break the Imam will let him shave off his beard. The clergyman agrees and Liyu rolls his barrel down the steep hill of a riverbed. To everyone's surprise the barrel does not break. Liyu shaves the Imam's beard disregarding the pleas of the others. He comes back home without money for the barrel. His father beats him with the craftsmen's belt. After few days some villagers from the Muslim village ask Liyu to take the barrel of the river. It is being smashed against the rocks and the noise drives the villagers mad. Liyu agrees and descends in the riverbed on a rope. Fighting the strong current and the Imam's desire to drown him Liyu manages to take out the barrel. Everybody wants to order him a new barrel. He goes home. His father hits him again with the belt as a punishment for his rash action. However the proud father acknowledges him as a real master.
