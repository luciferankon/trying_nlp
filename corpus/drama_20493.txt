Phineas Gage worked on the railroad in New England in the 1840's. One day a tamping iron passed through his skull totally destroying the left anterior lobe of his brain. Despite this he survived and was able to walk talk eat and carry on working for many years. But his character was subtly changed. His case is one of the most famous injuries ever survived and the most important in the history of neuro-science. It's a case known by anyone that has ever read a psychology text book. His story is very simple but raises profound issues around the nature of 'character' and what makes us who we are.
