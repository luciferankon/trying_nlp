He's philosophical loves poetry and lives with his mom and grandfather. Life gets complicated when he finds himself attracted to Abby one of the popular girls. When he starts hanging out with her even though he wants Wheels along in part to help him finish his sentences it causes friction between the two friends and gives Enoch pause about whether he should "leave town to make something of himself." Can he figure out what he wants without hurting anyone's feelings? Maybe not.
