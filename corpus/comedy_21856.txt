Danny Spencer is a voice artist who is recently bereaved and having a mid life crisis. As he continues to voice a kung fu bear he must also deal with his friends including a high school friend an old flame two lazy unemployed no hopers a 50 something who acts like a 20 year old and two dance music loving students who work with Danny at the voice studio. But none of this compares to the constant stress of turning 40 and remembering your youth.
