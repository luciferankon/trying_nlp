Diane Summers' mother died giving birth to her and Diane has been terrified of the same thing happening to her if she becomes pregnant. When her boyfriend Bruce Gordon proposes to her she agrees to marry him on one condition--that the marriage never be consummated so that she will never have children. Gordon agrees but soon finds the situation unbearable and leaves her. Diane seeing how happy other women are with their children finally changes her mind about not having children of her own and sets out to find her husband and inform him. However the train she's on is derailed and she is "rescued" by Phillip Darnton who has his own plans for Diane--and they don't include bringing her back to her husband.
