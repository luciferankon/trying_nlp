Alex has just bumped into his long lost high school sweetheart Audrey at mall. His Feelings for her never withered even after a long loss of contact. They kiss hug and catch up on old times. Then he has to take her number so they can keep in touch. He hands over his phone to her to punch in her number but then an ensuing confusion: her mum hurries out of a near-by store and frantically begins to pull her away not even paying noticing him as they were going to miss their flight out of town. In the confusion she hurriedly punches in the numbers... all but the last three digits. Alex doesn't notice this until after she's gone. Now he is anxious to meet the love of his life again but 3 digits stand between him and her. He must find her. This begins his sweet and sour random phone call adventure as he gradually falls into the habit of inputting the last three digits of her phone numbers and dialing a number each time changing the number combinations hoping that one of them would be Audrey on the other end of the call. This exercise introduces him to different characters from different parts of the country each with a different kind of adventure for the young man. The Last 3 digits is a gripping romantic comedy/adventure that showcases the diverse culture and character of Nigerians from different regions and different works of life and the key role a telecommunication network plays in finding a lost love.
