Tracie and Becca two girls from the suburbs are on a bumpy ride of dysfunctional shenanigans where the bond of old-school sisterhood is the raft that keeps them afloat in their small apartment in New York City. Dysfunctional Duo is like "Sex and the City" with Payless shoes. These girls are not driven by men but men are often driven by them. Although they are not your stereotypical girls they try their damnedest to fit into the social types...some acceptable and some unacceptable. Originally from the suburbs Becca and Tracie met in grade school and grew into two very different women. Becca moved to New York City to pursue her career as a cut-throat day trader on Wall Street. Tracie married her high school sweetheart to pursue her dream of having 2.5 kids with a white picket fence. But when the economy collapsed and Tracie caught her husband with another woman these two girls found their way to a rent-stabilized apartment in Harlem. As it turns out "Making it" is not what they thought and now they're forced to redefine happiness in the pressure cooker of New York City. Between dealing with a collapsing economy the tick-tock of biological clocks and the cramped style of their apartment these girls rely on their old-school sisterhood to get them through tough times.
