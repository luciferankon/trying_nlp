Recently two allegations of sexual abuse against women in the military have made the headlines in the USA. Both cases involve men in charge of units set up to prevent such assaults but their alleged crimes are not isolated incidents. Last year the number of reported cases of sexual violence against women in the US military went up from 19000 to 26000 but the Pentagon believes up to 80% of sexual assaults go unreported. It is now a fact that a female soldier in the US military is more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted by one of her own colleagues than injured in battle.
