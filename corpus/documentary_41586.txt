Gene Tierney's life story would perfectly lend itself to a screenplay for a successful Hollywood movie with herself starring in it. She grew up in a well-to-do middle class family and began to write poetry at an early age. On a trip to Los Angeles she was taken on a tour through the Warner Studios. When Anatole Litvak spotted her he said to her mother : she ought to be in pictures. This was the beginning of a long career with masterpieces as Laura The Ghost and Mrs Muir Leave Her to Heaven. For Martin Scorsese she is maybe the most underrated actress of our time.
