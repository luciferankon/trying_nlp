An idealistic Dutch colonial officer posted to Indonesia in the 19th century is cohvinced that he can make the kinds of changes that will actually help the local people he is in charge of but circumstances soon make him realize just how out of touch he really is and it doesn't take long for things to go from bad to worse. Just after assistant resident (colonial district chief) Slotering of Lebak on Java reproaches his dinner host the regent (native feudal ruler) to over-exert the local commoners he dies of poisoning. The post goes to naive idealist Max Havelaar who means his oath of officer to protect the locals. He hopes paying the native officials better even advances at his own expense will allow them to fulfill their family obligations. After Max finds the abuses continues even worse now than he imagined a test of force starts which ruins many lives mainly but not only native. Interwoven is the story of Saƒèdjah's farming family and their water buffaloes.
