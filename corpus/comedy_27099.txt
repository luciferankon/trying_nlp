Young parents Raj and Anna are from two totally different worlds. The diverse heritage of multicultural families like theirs can pose some interesting challenges. But they can definitely agree on one thing: their parents are totally off their rockers - especially when it comes to grandchildren. Anna and Raj envision raising their baby boy Clark together on their own terms. But reality has a way of intruding on even the best intentions - or in this case the baby's grandparents have a way of intruding. Anna's meddling conservative parents and much younger 'miracle' sister have come to help with the baby and show no signs of leaving. And now they've decided to raise some money for Clark's college by entering him in a beauty contest dressed as a girl. Raj's once-absent-but-now-devoted mother is building a nursery nicer than Anna and Raj's whole apartment - all part of her determination to give Clark the childhood that Raj never had. All Anna and Raj have to do is tell their parents to back off and do things their way. That shouldn't be too hard right? Anna and Raj's parents may be a little over-the-top but as Anna and Raj eventually realize it really does take a village to raise a child - even if the village is a little 'out there'.
