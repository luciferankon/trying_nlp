Why do we accept huge levels of inequality and social injustice? This is one of the central questions that The Price of Fairness sets out to answer beginning with a surprising set of social experiments in Norway which suggest that our willingness to support systems of inequality is far greater than we are often prepared to admit. In Atlanta we take a different look at fairness from the perspective of a group of capuchin monkeys. Behavioural scientist Sarah Bronson's work with the monkeys questions the idea that we have an evolutionary tendency towards selfish behaviour. Could it be that the outrage we feel towards systems of inequality have roots in our human need for cooperation? We visit Costa Rica and Iceland to see how whole economies have been engineered to function with greater 'fairness' and the US where systematic racial injustices have tested many of their citizens hopes for a fairer justice system. From the caste-biased villages of India to the race-sensitive streets of Ferguson Missouri this documentary explores our understanding of fairness and what it takes to change an unfair system. Touching on issues of economic political racial and gender inequality this film offers a thought-provoking and timely look at what fairness really means to us.
