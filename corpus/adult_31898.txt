Set somewhere off I-40 in the hot and dusty town of Weed New Mexico Hung Country for Young Men tells the tale of drifter who causes havoc for a small town gay sheriff when he steals and sleeps his way through the town. Along the way we meet the owner of the local Roadhouse Saloon who has a sizzling yet romantic scene with his beer delivery guy and three bar patrons who end up in a wild 3 way in the Saloon's men's room. The last scene features a climactic-in more ways than one!-encounter between the Sheriff and the Drifter that is as hot as it is surprising.
