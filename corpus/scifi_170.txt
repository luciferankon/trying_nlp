On near-future Earth dwindling fuel supplies have sparked worldwide strife. Major economies square off against third world terror groups. NCR 1236 a small off-world methane refinery on Titan (Saturn's moon) eases the demand and a small crew of hardy roughnecks and military personnel have stepped up to the job. Gideon Stark a man with a past tells lies to his daughter. She wants to know the real reason he won't come home. The truth is Gideon has much darker issues to work out. When the largest solar flare in human history strikes unexpectedly and all communications are knocked off line Gideon discovers that he and the station are cut off from Earth. Unaware of the event scope the crew looks forward to a temporary four day shut down. Their dreams of paid vacation evaporate when a scout ship crash lands and Major Harlee Jane a shadowy military liaison informs them that a massive terrorist attack has been launched under the disruption of the solar flare. She's been ordered to secure the refinery and take martial control but it's clear to Gideon that she has a hidden agenda. Soon people begin to act strange and disappear. Gideon concludes an alien terrorist posing as human has infiltrated the station with the goal of destroying everyone and everything on the base. No one knows "who's-who" as Gideon rallies the survivors for a last ditch stand to save not only their lives but the lives of every human being on Earth.
