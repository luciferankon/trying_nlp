'It is not one way' is an independent film by David Kenny about the rise of fear towards Muslims in Great Britain better known as Islamophobia. The film follows three people from different parts of Great Britain who all have exceptionally different takes on Islam. One is a member of the English Defence League a man who truly hates and fears Islam believing the growth of Islam in the UK will cause 'mass genocide'. On the other side of the coin is a man who in his own words is 'continuing the fight his grandad did against the Nazis'. He is a member of ANTIFA (Anti-Fascist Network). Our third character is a Muslim who is very passionate about community work and improving the lives for those living in the North East. He classes himself as a 'humanitarian'. We want to see what will happen when those three people are confronted with one another and forced to talk. Will they respect one another? Will any fears be removed?
