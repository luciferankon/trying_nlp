On Friday November 13 1982 the Beastie Boys consisting of band members John Berry Michael Diamond (Mike D) Adam Yauch (MCA) (a.k.a. Nathanial Hornblower) and Kate Schellenbach (later of Luscious Jackson) played Philip Pucci's birthday for the purposes of this short concert film of the Beastie Boys. Pucci held the concert in Bard College's Preston Drama Dance Department Theatre. This performance marked the Beastie Boys first on screen appearance in a published motion picture. Pucci's concept for Beastie was to distribute a mixture of half dozen 16mm Bell and Howell and Bolex cameras to audience members and ask that they capture the Beastie Boys performance from the audiences own point of view while a master sync sound camera filmed from the balcony of the abandoned theater where the performance was held. The opening band for that performance was The Young and the Useless which featured Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock) as their lead singer. A one minute clip of "Beastie" was subsequently excerpted and licensed by the Beastie Boys for use in the "Egg Raid on Mojo" segment of the "Skills to Pay the Bills" long form home video released by Capitol Records. Skills to Pay the Bills went on to earn the Recording Industry Association of Americas (R.I.A.A.) gold sales award for selling more than 500000 copies.
