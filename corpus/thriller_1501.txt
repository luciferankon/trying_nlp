Humans by day refugees by night finding any hole into which to crawl as the natural light diminishes holing up wherever they can to keep them from the outside. As the sun sets every window door and crack is sealed and any form of entertainment is utilized to keep the survivors' thoughts from what lies in the dark. An old shell of a pub is transformed into a refuge with people flocking from every corner of the ruined country. However... the survivors stop coming. For weeks the pub lies quiet until one day in the dead of night a sudden new arrival destroys the peaceful harmony and soon whatever danger lurks on the outside is as nothing compared to the creatures that lie within.
