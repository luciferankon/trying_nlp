A comedic parody of the golden age of television where episodes of "Bonanza" and "The Andy Griffith Show" have their original soundtracks wiped out (a la "What's Up Tiger Lily) and replaced with more "updated" story and dialog for today's depraved TV schedule. Hosted by "Insectavora" (AKA Angelica Velez).
