The S.S. Love & Happiness is the cruise ship known for making romantic dreams come true but the passengers on this voyage are a turbulent bunch. From the captain (Sam Logan) who is more concerned with stalking women than steering the ship to the couple (Carl Payne and Tammy Townsend) hoping to reignite their marriage and the divorced man (Khalil Kain) celebrating his new independence everyone on board is rocking the boat. Can this ship be righted and the relationships saved before the trip ends or is this dream vacation cruising to disaster?
