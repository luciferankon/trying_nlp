This is Zejd - he's a great student only he can't hear. In order for Zejd to be able to go to school like the other children and in order for him to not merely have this right in theory on paper his teacher Sanela and his parents get together with his classmates to make sure that the lessons are inclusive. In so doing not only Zejd and his fellow students make progress - everyone involved learns a great deal. In a still war-torn Sarajevo the collective efforts of a schoolteacher & parents to create a learning environment for a deaf boy without government aid becomes a success story that gives new life to the inclusionary education debate worldwide.
