The marriage of television director Ted Glover and television producer A.G. Bannister has gone on the rocks because she has permitted her career to take precedence over romance. The horror of it all! Complications also arise because of a romance between Ted's agent Steve Laughlin and a performer Billy-Joe Henley with a touring Hootenanny group. The resolvement comes when A.G. realizes that love is more important than a career - dang tootin' it was in a Sam Katzman movie in the 60's - but not before the likes of guest stars The Brothers Four Sheb Wooley Johnny Cash The Gateway Trio Judy Henske George Hamilton IV Joe & Eddie Cathie Taylor and (Bob's boy) Chris Crosby work up a sweatin' storm trying to create a craze for "Hootenanny".
