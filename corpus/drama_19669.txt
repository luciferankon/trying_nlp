Aber Bergen is an entertaining courtroom drama about the recently separated  but for the time being professional partners Erik Aber and Elea Bergen. They are two of the country's sharpest defense attorneys who together with an unorthodox team lawyers have built up a reputable law firm where they attempt to balance professional and private as they are thrown between moral political and legal dilemmas.
