After studying filmmaking I rediscovered a book written by my mom's uncle Miguel Contreras Torres The Black Book of Mexican Cinema. Through his investigations I found out about his memorable life and the situation he lived in how he witnessed a fresh successful film industry go down in the hands of the movie house monopoly owner William O. Jenkins. By looking and recycling his films and knowing the past perhaps we can avoid repeating the same mistakes in this the age of digital cinema.
