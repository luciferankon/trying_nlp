Yorkshire 1978. A mother father and their three year old son are brutally stabbed to death while they sleep. There is no motive. They were a model family. The nation is outraged by the senseless killings. Incredibly the British public are overwhelmingly in favour of bringing back the death penalty to see justice carried out. Even more incredibly the killer who is caught red-handed trying to drag the father's body out of the house manages to hide the three year old's body in a place where the investigators the police and even their dog teams would never find it. For months all the nation can talk about is the "Kid Killer" but and this is the most incredible fact of all not because he cold-bloodedly stabbed to death a three year old his mother and his father but because these innocent victims were also his family. The "Kid Killer" was their twelve year old son William. Malvern thirty years later. Ryan is thirty three. He dreams of being a journalist with a national voice. He has done all his life. However he's still working for the same small newspaper he started at thirteen years ago. He's an underachiever who quietly blames everyone else for his own failure. His mother ran out on him when he was just a child and the only person who has ever been proud of him is his father who's funeral he's just attended. So why is William finally released from a life of prisons social workers and psychologists and living under a new identity giving Ryan the chance to be the one who tells his story to the world? A story that is ingrained in the public's memory. A story that has become synonymous with unmitigated evil. A story that will dominate every facet of the media for months especially if Ryan can uncover where William buried his three year old brother's body. Right from the outset Ryan's running out of time. William psychologically damaged beyond repair is now only interested in one thing killing himself and Ryan holds the key. Five pills being developed by his wife's pharmaceutical company would to do it. Easily painlessly. So can Ryan convince Karen that she should take the risk to get them? It could take them out of the spiralling hole of debt they're in and change their dead-end life but Karen knows that Ryan could actually do this himself if he just had the ambition. Maybe her risk will spark some ambition. Maybe Karen didn't see their lifeless marriage turning out this way. Maybe it's time for a change. William will give Ryan five meetings to get the story he wants. Five meetings tinged with mental and physical torture. Each meeting costs Ryan a pill and without the location of the three year old's body he has nothing and doesn't William know it. It's a game of Russian Roulette for Ryan where every pill could spell the end of William the end of the story. The secret lost forever. Ryan also has a secret. One that would change his life forever if only he knew it were there and now the only one who can tell him is his dead father. In a final twist that will make the public look away in shame we learn that amidst the anger the bitterness and the demented theories of a tortured mind who can't live with himself that this is actually a story of incredible courage ultimate sacrifice and love.
