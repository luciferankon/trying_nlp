A life and an underworld summarized in one night. Ulises a boy of 25 years old is left by his couple Pablo and thrown to the street. Without a house without a job and without a home to come back to Ulises vague at night in search for love and a destination for his life but he is trapped in the rough and tumble of the winding Argentine gay night. Before leaving the apartment in which they lived together for a time Ulises steals money and a gun. Pablo enraged begins a hunt around the city to find Ulises and become trapped in the micro gay world of the City of Buenos Aires. The two lead characters in this story search each other in the labyrinth of passions of the night while they revisited their relationship ended. Pablo newly entered in the homosexual life sees as his world of security and strength is breaking down in front of his eyes while falling back to the networks of the night and marginality. Ulises a survivor returns to the streets where he was expelled and looks in the bowels of the city a place to live. Built in the underground for centuries the codes of homosexuality are visible to those who know and inhabit that world and remain invisible to those who are unaware: cruising areas the clubs the places of prostitution. Night of the wolf is a mythical journey by the customs of homosexuality a rereading in a contemporary key of two major French authors of the queer literature (Jean Genet and Marcel Proust); and an alive chronicle of the way we live now.
