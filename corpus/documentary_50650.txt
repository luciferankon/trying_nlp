The protagonists of SEEING VOICES may not be able to hear but that definitely does not leave them without words. Sign language represents a parallel universe full of magic and expressive power which remains unexplored country for the vast majority of people. Ayse Helene and the non-hearing members of the Hager family don't lament their inability to hear music or birds singing: after all these are sounds they have never experienced. But they are denied the right to their mother tongue. They employ different techniques to master their lives walking the line between the hearing of the world - and refusing to be silent. Eleven years ago Austrian Sign Language was constitutionally recognised as an "independent language". But the country still has a long way to go to a barrier-free and thus inclusive life for the deaf. That goes for a simple visit to the doctor's as well as for attending school.
