In 2012 Irish artist Tom Byrne assumed the identity of Stephen Daedalus and walked around Dublin on Blooms Day in order to prepare for his work on a large scale painting inspired by the imagery of James Joyce's masterpiece novel "Ulysses'. This film explores the idea of memory in Ulysses as it intercuts between Byrne's journey around Dublin on 16th June 2012 a later audio only interview of his recollections of that Bloom Day and his subsequent working in his studio on the painting it inspired in August 2013.
