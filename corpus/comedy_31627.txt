Arun Verma lives in India along with his widower dad Hiralal. He gets married to Kaajal mainly due to the fact that Hiralal wants grandchildren to lighten up his life. When Kaajal fails to conceive Hiralal is disappointed and asks Arun to re-marry but Arun is reluctant. Arun and his friend Jumbo leave for a trip to Nepal and in their absence Hiralal has a heart attack and is looked after by Kaajal. When Arun gets the news he hastens home to find his dad recuperating and insisting that Kaajal is now his daughter as well as his daughter-in-law and asks Arun to adopt a child instead of re-marrying. Arun and Kaajal adopt a male child and also find a nanny named Manisha for him. Then chaos and uncertainty descends on Kaajal's world as she finds that Arun is having an affair with Manisha - who it seems is more than just a nanny for their foster son.
