An artist's film that asks a lot of questions - it's up to the audience's experiences to provide answers. It is an investigation of our human relationship with mechanical and technological systems of our place within an information environment. It questions film and photographic methods of representing the fictions and documents of our world and the social framework that distributes and exhibits these experiences. It is an aesthetic journey into our recognition of images and our biases toward order and comprehensibility. And it ponders our human role in face of entropy. All in all the history of photography backwards.
