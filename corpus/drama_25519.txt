The characters are members of an anti-fascist combat group. Six of them are betrayed and apprehended. During the investigation the police entangle one of them in a crafty piece of intrigue so that the other will imagine him to be an agent provocateur. Suspicion sneaks into the group. By suspicion and doubt the police try to split the six men who are untied by their common ideals and fate. But after an excruciating inner struggle trust gains the upper hand: each of characters is sooner prepared to die than believe in unproven guilt of one of his comrades and betray them all.
