When the man in Airborn becomes a disciple of teachers who are nothing but air-high hilarity opens a paradoxical doorway to deep significance. What we worship on our altars may be as inane as manic blow-up dummies stationed in front of used car lots. Unorthodox teachers the best kind never stick around long. And when they deflate hilarity mixes with a pitiful but tender ache. Such sentimentality over the fate of inane blow-up dummies? Therein lies the improbable magic of Airborn.
