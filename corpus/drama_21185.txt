Ever since Kylor Creighton was able to walk he had become fascinated with the most peculiar things. Unlike most 16 year olds he spent most of his time outside reflecting on the books in which he has read time and time again. Being home schooled he didn't have many friends or people he could talk too. In fact he rarely spoke to anyone unless he was spoken to first. His thoughts were all written down on paper. The only person whom he had a decent and actual conversation with was his grandfather of whom he's never met. Since Kylor could write they have been writing notes to one another talking about life death and the things in between. When Kylor got the news his grandfather had died he was given one last letter and that letter was going to change his life forever.
