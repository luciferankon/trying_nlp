An alien Gozonian tribe conspires to destroy planet Earth and rule over the entire universe. The Gozonian tribe was destroyed earlier by the inter-galactic council. However they rose to power after the invention of a powerful weapon that can possibly increase the human race intelligence. The tribe's evil leader takes back the bionic body from Dr Para for his extreme lust for power. A giant robotic dinosaur creates havoc under Ru Bonda's command. But Kid Krrish successfully destroys it thus infuriating him. The Gozonian leader approaches Ru Bonda for his help in obtaining a rare Blue Diamond which is present in South Africa's lion crown mountain. On the other hand Krrish also finds out about Gozonian's plan from his father's diary which he finds in Dr Para's hideout. He along with Mengue travels to South Africa's lion crown mountain. He cleverly sneaks in behind Ru Bonda with the help of the animals. Eventually Krrish successfully defeats the Gozonian tribe and rescues the entire human race from annihilation.
