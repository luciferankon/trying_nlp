North of Everything is an experience of two filmmakers that captures both the beauty of Iceland and the culture of people who make it such an intriguing place. It's a title that stems from a need for wanderlust. A desire to go out into the world and create for the sake of creating and go further than you'd ever journeyed before. The result after years of mental and emotional exhaustion. Through various conversations with strangers and newly found friends the film carries a tone of looking for more than just an adventure. It's director is seeking something misplaced; himself.
