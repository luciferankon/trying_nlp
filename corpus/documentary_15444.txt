A documentary study by Ivan Vojnár featuring people picked at random and famous personalities he has met in the Café Konvikt and other places in Prague. Not unlike figures from a Hrabal story they represent a very broad range of types - from a mentally handicapped road-sweeper to a philosopher. Each person even the most seemingly normal is exceptional in some way. Most speak directly to the camera about their relations work simple and difficult problems democracy and Czech society in general.
