Scissors and Glue: The Miami Project explores art in real time in the vibrant city of Miami. This documentary film takes an intimate look at a young city with an old soul. It examines the way in which artistic expression and exhibition relates to and also influences community development. Scissors and Glue dares to ask "Which is more powerful culture's influence on art or art's influence on culture and what is the responsibility of art in urban society?" Miami has become a magnet for art lovers from around the globe. Scissors and Glue follows Helmut Schuster on his journey as a gallery owner in Berlin to the founding of his new Gallery Schuster in Miami. Also highlighted in this film is the emergence of Art Basel Miami Beach as one of the largest art fairs in the world and its major impact not only on the art community but Miami as a whole. Some of the worlds most important galerists speak in front of the camera in "Scissors & Glue" for the first time ever.
