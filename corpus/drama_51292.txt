Eduardo and Luca are father and son. They haven't seen each other for over ten years. One day the phone rings and the call will bring them back together suddenly and painfully. This time they won't have a second chance. A rep from Casale's hospital is on the phone calling to inform Luca that his father Eduardo is seriously ill suffering of a terminal disease: the mesothelioma 'the asbestos cancer'. The fast progression of the disease will bring father and son closer together bringing them to fight each other at first but forcing Luca to understand his father's sacrifices during life. Eduardo worked at Eternit for over 30 years since he emigrated North to give his family a safer future. In the background of the story there is the entire city of Casale Monferrato which is in turmoil due to the approaching of the Eternit trial. The day after the judgement a journalist wrote: 'Casale is the city that taught the world how to obtain justice.' 'A safe place' is an illusion - the false promise that many workers have received and still receive in Italy as well as in the rest of the world trading their own health and life for the security of a job.
