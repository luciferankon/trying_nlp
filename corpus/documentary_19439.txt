Life As From Inside is an effort to transpose philosophical thinking into film language thus making it possible to enter the inner generic process of a philosophical thought. The film explores the methods and thoughts of three eminent Slovene philosophers while the visual language becomes an aid for understanding or maybe even setting a guideline for a deeper observance of everyday life.
