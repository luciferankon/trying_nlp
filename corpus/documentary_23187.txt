Profile of the German philosopher Gustav Heckmann (1898 - 1996) who was the initiator of the so called "Urgent Call" against Hitler. In 1932 this was the last attempt by intellectuals (like Albert Einstein KÃ¤the Kollwitz Heinrich Mann and others) to prevent the takeover of power by Hitler in Germany. This is the one and only film profile of Gustav Heckmann ever made. Gustav Heckmann was later a friend of both Max Born and Werner Heisenberg.
