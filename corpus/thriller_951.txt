When the B horror movie CHAIN-FACE CLOWN was released in 1985 no one knew the film would one day become a classic heralded as a cinematic tour de force - Well at least by a select group of horror movie fans. The film's biggest fan 29 year-old EMILY LYNESSA always knew she was going to meet and fall in love with JONATHAN BLAKLEE mid 40s the star of CHAIN-FACE CLOWN. For Emily Jonathan is the perfect soulmate; no other male compares to him. She has idolized him and the film ever since she can remember. Emily has collection of CHAIN-FACE CLOWN memorabilia that would impress even the most ardent fan. But there is one item she has yet to attain - The real life breathing Jonathan Blaklee. There's only one problem -- Emily knows Jonathan will have no interest in her because he's famous and she's not. Her plan is simple: Meet Jonathan at an up-coming signing for the DVD re-release of CHAIN-FACE CLOWN and then seduce him. She will lure him back to her home where Jonathan will be imprisoned inside her home until he realizes Emily is the one for him. She puts her plan into action - Emily successfully lures Jonathan back to her pad. After a night of debauchery Jonathan awakes -- he is now imprisoned in an abandoned shed on the rural farm's property. Jonathan must now find a way to escape or forever be the ultimate addition to Emily's CHAIN-FACE CLOWN memorabilia collection.
