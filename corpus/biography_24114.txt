This is the story of a tiny country that made a decision to do something that no other country had ever done -- it decided to abolish its army and declare peace to the world. And this is the story of a young boy who grew up in that country and how he ended up challenging -- and sometimes even convincing -- the greatest powers in the world to follow Costa Rica's example. "Oscar Arias: Without a Shot Fired" is a Don Quixote-like saga with great historical touchstones -- Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev Cold War politics and Communism Central American War and Peace. It follows a slight academic and most unlikely hero over the course of more than fifty years as he travels the world in a quest to stop the spread of the weapons of war. In the end it is a story about the triumph of reason of the sparrow triumphing over the eagle and how the impossible dream can sometimes come true.
