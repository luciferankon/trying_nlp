Jason is a tough skateboard kid from a single-parent home who has found himself entangled in a life of crime and darkness. Meanwhile Steve is an increasingly frustrated minister at a well-respected church in town - the same church where his now deceased father-in-law ministered for 30 years. One night as Steve as confronted by Jason and his friends Jason's words cut deep. Steve cannot forget the truth that came from this skateboarder "punk". Steve decides what he must do - he will make Jason and his friends his new heavenly assignment. Unfortunately Steve's congregation is not as excited as he is about reaching wayward youths. Steve and Jason are on the same road confused and unsure about their futures as they begin a friendship that is about to bring changes they could not have possibly imagined.
