What really happened in Boston on April 15 2013? If you have missed it here is a film that will bring you up to speed. Marathon Day: Boston 15.4.13. A 72min documentary film which summarizes/compares the Boston bombings from the perspective of the official story through the eyes of the mainstream media and the questions asked by millions about its credibility both by independent media sources and the public! The film is presented in the form of direct evidence all news media reports are verifiable and available publicly on the Internet. Mainstream vs independent Internet media is the subject! What is the truth? Why didn't the mainstream media report on the 'Bomb Drill' that was taking place on the day? Why do the witnesses on alternative media contradict the witness reports presented by mainstream? Why did the mainstream fail to report on the military undercover operatives at the scene of the first explosion? Why was the FBI mentoring the Tsarnaev brothers? Who is really behind this? Who gains from these 'terror attacks' and how have previous attacks reshaped our lives? See the two perspectives and be the judge! Is there a real conspiracy here?
