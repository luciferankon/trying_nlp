THE COLOR BEARERS offers a passionate and inspirational look at American patriotism. With compelling contemporary and historical American stories and exposing the myths and misconceptions that surround today's definition of the word Patriot. American Patriotism has been thrust into the national debate in current political dialogue - yet the word Patriotism - like the word Love - is so subjective that people in the debate arrive agreeing or disagreeing with each other before the conversation begins. Often confused with Blind Nationalism Patriotism may be one of the most misunderstood words in the current English vernacular. The Color Bearers holds American Patriotism up to the light and looks at it from a human perspective instead of from an idealogical one. It catches its audiences off guard - The Right arrive expecting to "Hail to the Chief" - The Left arrives expecting to assail the Right - neither gets what they came for - almost everyone leaves with something they didn't know before a lump in their throat and a tug on their heart strings. Heart-warming engaging and informative programming for people of all ages and interests.
