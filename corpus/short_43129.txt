Minus is a fiction and at the same time experimental movie which doesn't enjoy any distinct geography language and time. The events occur in a razor producing company in which a young and simple retainer is working who has special capabilities. He knows telepathy and he can read the minds of all people and even things. Most of the time his predictions increase his ability of presentiment.
