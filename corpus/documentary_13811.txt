3419 in 2014 3771 in 2015 2814 already in the first semester of 2016*. The emigrants dying in the Mediterranean Sea are constantly increasing but the flowing of the figures might make us forget that each time we are speaking of people and lives and not just of numbers. The tragedy occurred on October 3rd 2013 in front of the coasts of Lampedusa caused the death of 500 people and has become emblematic for the number of victims ( "record of deaths" at that moment unfortunately surpassed in the following years) but also because for the 366 bodies retrieved from the sea most of them still unnamed. To understand this tragedy of our times we must start from the "nurturing" of an individual and collective memory. Each time we eliminated the figures and numbers to remove the problem as if there were no more space in our mental hard disk. These figures are isolated from their context and exasperated in order to feed our deepest fears. *UNHCR records The idea of the film A man is walking around the island of Lampedusa reciting the names of the victims of October 3rd 2013. This man is Marco Pietrantuono. He is one of the very few established Italian hyperthymesiacs people with an extraordinary autobiographical memory. If the victims' names are declared by a person who will never forget their names they will be remembered thus symbolically alive for ever.
