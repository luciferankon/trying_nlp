Liza quits her job as a lawyer when she realizes that she's not ready to settle down and become a wife and mother like her fiance Mitch expects her to. Liza breaks it off with Mitch and starts over using the money she saved for her wedding to open up a new business: a doggy day care called 'Fetching!' She hires her friends Matt Daveed and the loveable Adi to help out. As the business grows Liza struggles to juggle challenging clients (and their dogs) the business competition and her brother's family. All the while she is trying to find love again. The question is has she already met the perfect man for her and her dog Oscar?
