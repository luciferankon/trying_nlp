Commercial fishing: one of the world's most dangerous ways to earn a living. For centuries fishermen have braved the waters of the northeast Atlantic to make their catch some never to return home. But in 2004 the scallop boat Northern Edge sank taking with it five of the six men on board. The lucrative fishing port of New Bedford Massachusetts changed forever. The loss of the Northern Edge spurred a response on every front. Fishermen politicians and lawmakers alike took a new look at the safety of those who fish the Atlantic waters for a living. In one of the most regulated industries in the country however an imbalance between conservation law and safe practice emerged. But as loss of life continued in years since 2004 the industry is left wondering: Can conservation efforts and fishermen's safety co-exist?
