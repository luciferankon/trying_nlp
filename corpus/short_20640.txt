The Invisibles are every day women who walk the streets and work in your homes. They are the women who raise your children. In exchange for giving their whole lives in service they are often left out in the cold. We follow women from an adoption agency as they tackle their duties as nannies and talk about the joys and injustices of their jobs. There is an inside look into the lives of women who are often overlooked and undervalued. The film tackles human rights violations through employment as well as shining a light on the "Surrogate moms" who often go unrecognized.
