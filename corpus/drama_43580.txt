Radio Waves revolves around an Auckland commercial radio station. Drive-time DJ is Win Savage (Grant Bridger) Andy Anderson is a hippy 'jock' and Alan Dale plays urbane station manager Jack in his screen debut (before finding fame on Australia's Neighbours) and the many women on staff put up with their share of stick from all that male ego. Waves was short-lived - The Bee Gees and flares weren't enough for viewers to shut the farm gate - but its urban strides signaled a changing face for New Zealand on screen.
