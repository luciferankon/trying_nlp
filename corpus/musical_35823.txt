A pop musical loosely based on 'Nicholas Nickleby' Smike! is the story of a group of restless school-children who go back in time to the world of Charles Dickens and see for themselves that there are advantages in living in the twenty first century. The boys of the Kingston Grammar School Kingston-upon-Thames take part alongside the star cast.
