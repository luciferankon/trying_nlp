The first time I saw someone get shot I was 10 years old says Delfino Jacquez. It's a stunning statement from the senior point guard at Kansas City's Northeast High School. It's even more striking that the story is not all that uncommon among students in the Kansas City Missouri School District. CityBall is a feature-length documentary showcasing a year in the life of student athletes. Once the toast of Kansas City athletics the Interscholastic League is now riddled with problems including budget cuts below average facilities coaching turn-over and staffing shortages. The students themselves have to overcome daunting odds just to graduate from high school. This project explores the positive role of athletics in the precarious lives of these impressionable students. It also delves into the roles played by parents coaches and school administrators in the many decisions that influence the futures of young athletes in Kansas City.
