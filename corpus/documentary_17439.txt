Documentary film "Sugar Factory" is the story of this unusual place the people who have marked it. From the Storyteller's father Petar Miljkovic who was in so many ways linked to the fate of a country as well as the embassy residence all the way to the Storyteller Boris Miljkovic who found himself in that very house in 1991 at the dawn break up of Yugoslavia. This private history of one no more existing country becomes an original genesis of being a refugee by all means. Seemingly unrelated events in this very personal history acquire its logical order regardless of the time when they appeared in a kaleidoscope of events. So the whole story suggests the drama of nowadays the painful history of homeless people who at the certain moment came a long line of sadness isolation nostalgia and emptiness. Nevertheless the structure of storytelling give us a warm and cordial picture of Middle East its people told by a group of expats living in Cairo for a long time.
