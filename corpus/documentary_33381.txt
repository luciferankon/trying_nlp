Producer Mark Johnson introduces the show and then we get notes from Cast and Crew. Visualizing" features an unusual format for a documentary. It follows the movie and comments on aspects of the flick as we see them. Essentially we watch the entire film as the show maintains a look at the final production at almost all times. We also see behind the scenes footage storyboards pre-vis shots concept art pre-effects photography and other background elements.
