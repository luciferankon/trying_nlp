Legends of Lacey Township: A Tour Through Time is a locally produced history documentary about three villages that make up Lacey Township on the New Jersey Shore. With a simple budget of under $900 raised through an Indiegogo campaign four filmmakers completed the project in just over 2 months. The documentary tells the story of an out-of-the-way hunting and fishing destination with just over 850 residents that became a boom town with the addition of a major highway and a nuclear power plant in the 1960's. With no narrator necessary residents and local historians tell the story of Lacey Township. Jeremy Muermann (Director) is a high school TV Production teacher at Lacey Township High School and was approached by his fellow creators and former students Andrew DiAngelis (Cinematographer Editor) and Steven Krawiec (Production Manager) about working on the documentary during their college summer break. Muermann's former student Winter Rose Barney (Production Assistant Social Media Manager) joined production as it began in earnest.
