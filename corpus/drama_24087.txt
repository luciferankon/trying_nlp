A woman of low morals who runs a gambling operation in her house takes pride in destroying the men she ensnares in her net. One of these men's wives (played by Bebe Daniels) will not let her get away with it. She poses as a single girl to get hired by the woman as her secretary and then proceeds to singlehandedly take her operation apart.
