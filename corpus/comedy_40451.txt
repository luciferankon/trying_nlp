One more Saturday in a desolate Buenos Aires hard to recognize. Six young people that try to avoid their solitude by complicating their daily routes unsuccessfully looking for a glance that changes something or a new sensation that reveals them some sense. A couple used to their common tediousness a girl who has already decided she wants to be alone his boyfriend who does not know how to deal with that a famous actor who does not seem to feel comfortable anywhere and a girl who pretends to get fun without realizing she's always bored.
