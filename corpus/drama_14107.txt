Leon is a newcomer in gigantic Los Angeles after he just broke up with Eva and left his past on the East Coast behind. This tentacular city happens to be a fertile ground for this young lost and dreamless guy's neuroses. Director Laurier Fourniau has filmed Leon's downward spiral throughout the city of angels always working with the tension of where "reality" stops and "fiction" starts.
