'The Proper Care & Feeding of an American Messiah' is the mockumentary story of a man who thinks he is a messiah. Not *the* messiah but rather a local regionally selected messiah for his own home-town. He's on a quest desperately trying to raise money for a town-wide rally where he hopes to announce his deity - and to determine his true god-given 'special purpose' in life - which may or may not have something to do with ailments of the lower gastrointestinal tract but he won't be sure until he hears more or less directly from Yahweh.
