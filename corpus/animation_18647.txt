The heart of the 26 episodes is Stanley Hopper. As the only dragon around to have been raised among people he's considered to be a bit peculiar. He and his aristocratic wife Genevieve have three kids: the seven-year-old twins Julius and Julia as well as their daughter Zoe who is in the full bloom of teenagehood (which isn't the easiest age not even for dragons). Zoe also has a "pet" of sorts - Sir Cyril a knight who peppers the family's turbulent life with plenty of sarcastic commentary. And then there's also the Hopper Castle sentry who is also Stanley's best friend and a fount of shrewd advice. There's just one catch: the sentry's a hydra. With three heads. And they hardly ever agree on anything...
