Two teenage boys from St. Louis who have just finished high school decide to take a road trip to Winslow Arizona to present to the town a statue of Don Henley which one of the two has constructed. But the sculptor is a poor artist at best and the statue which everybody they meet takes to be someone other than Mr. Henley is damaged several times throughout the ill-fated trip causing the boys to re-evaluate their friendship and their future.
