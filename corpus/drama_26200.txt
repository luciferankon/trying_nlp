The well-ordered life of Dylan Thomas a high-priced male escort goes into moral free-fall beginning with the night he impulsively takes home a young woman he finds passed out drunk on a sidewalk. A sad little stray cat in a Lycra dress and Prada shoes Allison Campbell is looking for security or love and she may not know the difference. While Dylan plies his trade in swank hotels a tentative domestic relationship with seemingly homeless Allison evolves based on the illusion that neither of them has a past. Voyeurism is the dramatic strategy and the lure for this story.
