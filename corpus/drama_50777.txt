Life in Vanuatu isn't all sea sun and palm trees. For Timothy and his family life is hard. His daughter Betty is out of school because he can't pay her school fees. His wife works as a house girl and his son hangs around with his friends smoking dope like many other unemployed young men. Timothy's only hope is the political party he supports and when the man Timothy has collected votes for becomes a Minister Timothy dreams he will get a job and earn the money to send Betty back into school. But he is not the only supporter looking for work. And to get the job he wants he has to do things that make him question the whole system. Yumi Go Kale is the first feature made entirely by Wan Smolbag's cast and crew.
