Kelly Nobles has taken a day off and decides to go fishing for a few hours. As he is walking a friend Todd Bolton who is just joy riding in his pickup truck offers him a ride to the pond and decides to do a little fishing him. Not knowing Todd's plans Kelly accepts the ride and throws his fishing gear on the back of the truck and gets into it. Todd starts toward the pond and just as he rounds a curve he sees a beautiful young white girl Anna Kennedy who is holding up a sign saying to Interstate 40. Anna has run away from home after having a big fight with her father and among other unfolding reasons. Todd pulls the truck over and gives her a ride also. Once she is safely in the truck Todd heads on down the road. The men agree that Anna should be taken to the interstate first and afterward they would return to the lake and go fishing. Things turns bad when Todd turns down a side road and denies Anna a chance to get out of the truck. After a struggle between Anna and Todd she is knocked unconscious Kelly is hooked into a rape and murder situation.
