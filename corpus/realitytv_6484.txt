Produced in-house at MTV Canada MTV CREEPS features a rotating panel of three expert social media "creeps" (judges) that scrutinize the posts pictures and ultimately the virtual lives of three different social media addicts. Once each profile has been critiqued the "creepers" decide whether to add ignore or recommend their friends to remove them.
