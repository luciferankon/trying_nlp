Despite the existence of an international moratorium on all commercial whaling operations Iceland has allowed its whalers to kill 154 fin and 229 minke whales each year. This killing takes place in direct violation of the international moratorium which Iceland refuses to recognize. Paradoxically while Iceland's growing whale watching industry brings tens of thousands of tourists to Iceland each year Icelands's whalers continue to decimate the same whale populations. When German activist Arne Feuerhahn learns about the ongoing hunt he decides to found Hard To Port an initiative whose goal is to expose the slaugther of whales and to publicly reveal what the whalers are trying to hide. Motivated by an abhorrence for the unconscionable slaughter of some of nature's most majestic animals and emboldened by the growing international opposition to Iceland commercial whaling operations the activists of Hard To Port embark on a journey to Iceland with the aim of launching the first phase of their 'Whaler Watching' campaign and of disrupting the whaling season. '184' portrays the actions and findings of Hard To Port's two week journey to Iceland in the summer of 2015.
