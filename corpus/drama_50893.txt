Hollywood and Vine walks the line between dark comedy and tragedy as we follow a night in the life of five aspiring actors living in Los Angeles California. This raw improvisation-based movie unflinchingly shows a stylized world full of actor wannabees desperate to be seen and get their break - all of who have a deeply dysfunctional side that reveals itself most when they are alone. Randal Pistol is a pompous sex-addict. Wendy Hayworth is a virgin who lives in the shadow of her recently deceased mother. Chad Lewis is a reality TV star with a chip on his shoulder. Sheila Houston suffers from alcohol-induced schizophrenia. Cristina Rosenberg is a true thespian but she is a bit socially awkward... and she may have the biggest secret of them all. The story follows these colorful characters from a mansion party in the Hollywood Hills to their respective homes where the truth behind what drives and haunts them is unveiled.
