1108 is a haunting story about a young fun couple who anticipate moving into their first home together. Between the independence the cheap rent and the overall joy in their new lives nothing can stop their bond until they become unglued by the very thing they wanted- their home at 1108. It seems that it's not just the unexplainable occurrences in their home that leaves them on edge. Their very souls become corrupted.
