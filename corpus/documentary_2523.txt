Director Markus Bader and INFRACom! label manager Jan Hagenkoetter followed Jhelisa as she worked on her forthcoming album. Jhelisa introduces the diversity of New Orleans from the slave plantations to the city's boiling nightlife always from a very personal and critical perspective molded by her European years and her journeys through Brazil and South Africa. "One week with Jhelisa - Rediscovering America" has become a rare and precious testimony of the sunken musical capital of New Orleans.
