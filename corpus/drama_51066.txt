The story begins with a filmmaking team that's already sacrificed to make several professional feature films. While having significant indie budgets and films starring name actors they can't seem to get the attention of the industry elite. Upon learning the news that their latest endeavor will not be accepted into any top tier film festival the team has hit rock bottom. With heavy hearts they push each other to pick up and move forward on development of their next feature film a supernatural thriller called THE RED VISION in hopes that THIS will be the one that finally turns heads their direction. As development progresses the team lands actress Lauren Holly star of films like Dumb and Dumber Beautiful Girls and Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story and her voice shines as a guiding light of wisdom for the young filmmakers as they push forward through the trenches.
