In this documentary you will ride a reindeer with the Dukha of Mongolia on their annual spring migration. This film preserves the lives of one of the few groups still migrating on this planet as our ancestors did. No directions were given. Nothing was staged. This immersion film gives a true snapshot of the life nomads live today.
