Modern Christians desire relevancy yet an overwhelming majority have never heard a practical message on the topic of birth control. In our first film we showed how the culture slowly transformed the church into accepting birth control as biblical theology. In this film we ask if our desire to control procreation displays an accurate picture of the gospel in our marriages. Helping the viewer to make an informed decision this film helps Christian couples apply six biblical foundations to this important issue - The Sufficiency of Scripture The Gospel Picture in Marriage The Dominion Mandate The Natural Process Children as God's Blessing and our role in Parenthood - while chatting with couples of all ages and answering their most common objections along the way. One of the most overlooked areas of Christian discipleship is that of procreation. With scripture as its guide this film debates the use of birth control with six biblical foundations and speaks to the most common objections along the way.
