Metropolitan police inspector Dupin had previously been relocated to rural Britanny. His second case starts off on a remote island where the corpses of three drugged sailors were washed upon the shore. Dupin has to deal with sullen islanders and at the same time he wants to keep his ex-girlfriend in a good mood as she has traveled to visit him all the way from Paris. Transferred to Brittany from Paris by a vindictive superior French national police commissioner inspector Georges Dupin must examine the death of three drunk local men washed on their island's shore after a storm sinking. Autopsy shows they were seriously drugged staging an accident. The island is the battle ground between environmentalists defending a maritime reserve plan and a real estate development project. However Dupin also looks fro the medicinal provenance of the poison and digs in more personal relationships even a dark old past. A second murder follows.
