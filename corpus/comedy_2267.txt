Sonny (Steven Chase) and Archie (James Duval) are two Mafia wise guys and "contractors" for a 300 pound cigar chompin' obnoxious Mob Boss 'Ma' (Felissa Rose). They shake down local business for "protection" and do the occasional contract killings or rival take-outs. A comet has the world in a panic; doomsday media pundits claim it's the end of the world but NASA says it's not gonna happen- it's just media hype. Sonny is rethinking his life; his time could be up whether the comet hits or not. Sonny's thinking marriage to a nice girl maybe even kids and retire to a vineyard in Italy with his lifelong best buddy Archie. Neither of them trust their boss and know Ma could rub them out once they are of no use to her anymore...maybe it's time to cash themselves out before Ma does. The world's top 1% aren't taking any chances. Big City's wealthy fat cats plan to stash their money gold and valuables in mines in the rural mountains outside the city. A convoy will take the treasure there and Ma wants to hijack it. Barry Ling (Clint Jung) rival Chinese Mafia leader wants that convoy too. Sonny and Archie see an opportunity to hit this convoy be rid of Ma and take their dream early retirement. Federal Agents Bean (Dean McDermott) and his boss Agent Tracey (Martin Kove) see the same opportunity and more. They use Evvy (Judy Tenuta) a former Mafia moll as bait. She finds out that Bean and Tracey also plan to hit the convoy apprehend Ma and Ling which will cover for lifting some serious cash from the convoy. While they line their own pockets they are the heroes in an FBI sting operation known as "Garlic and Gunpowder." Even Mayor Brown (Vivica A. Fox) is on the take. Everyone has their plan for the heist...which one wins out? Do Sonny and Archie marry some "nice girls" and head to the Italian countryside or does the comet close it all down?
