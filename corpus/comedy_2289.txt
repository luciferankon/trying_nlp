Cripple judge judge Mair condemns fury-tempered single mother Sophie Brand who insolently stole Mair's handicapped parking space using her late grandfather's permit for serially-unpaid parking tickets to 300 hours community service in handicapped home "Haus am Park" without mentioning he arranged with the management to make her try kicking some life into his cynically-embittered wheelchair-ridden brother Georg Mair who chased anyone within the minute with gross language and shameless abuse. Sophie's equally fury-tempered reaction feeling a part-time job as supermarket filler on top of waitering in gentleman Jacques's classy restaurant to pay for angelic son Linus and his brat teen sister Laura who rebels against endless household and babysitter chores impresses Georg who becomes Linus's new best friend. Jaques invites the Brandts to his lake cabin even accepts Georg being dragged along after his only home friend Martin's death but tensions rises as both men learn being romantic rivals for her while Georg discloses his traumatic past and finds new life energy.
