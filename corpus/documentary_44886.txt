For over 20 years Out of Town was a television program that provided a window on country life in rural Britain. Fishermen and farriers horsemen and horticulturalists were prominently featured as presenter Jack Hargreaves took the Southern Television cameras around the country to explore pursuits and activities in the 1960s 70s and early 80s many of which have long since disappeared. When Out Of Town was first broadcast by ITV these programs soon won a large following for the entertaining and informative way that they gave a gentle insight into country life but as time has passed since the last transmission in 1981 they have become a nostalgic historical record of life in Britain from a bygone age.
