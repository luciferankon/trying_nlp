World War II. In August 1944 the German Military High Command planned to get the Second Hungarian Reserve Corps to crush the Warsaw Uprising in occupied Poland. Despite the military alliance between Germany and Hungary the hungarian contingent of thirty thousand troops refused to fight against Poles. The soldiers did not only provide ammunition weapons military information food and medicine for the resistant polish Home Army and the civilians of Warsaw but also planned to switch sides. Many of them died for polish freedom.
