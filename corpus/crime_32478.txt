In the aftermath of a deal gone bad two partners in crime Hicks (Zachary Block) and Cash (Robert Dill) are mere puppets in a twisted lineup of crime lords and "not quite so right in the head" villains. Amongst the haunting backdrop of the Mojave Desert they now have to wait out the storm with a less than appealing safety man Pox while an opposing crime boss Lou Garris (Duane Daniels) has them hunted down. Will they make it out just in time or is there even a way out? In the life of unorganized crime one thing's for sure "There's no such thing as Good Guys."
