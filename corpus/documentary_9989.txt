For many years archaeologists from Mexico and around the world have been drawn to the eternal stone gaze of the Olmec colossal heads. But who were these men of stone? Where did they come from and how did they manage to build the first great civilization of the Americas over 3500 years ago? The stone is both silent and responsive; it conceals and it reveals. Perhaps it is telling us that these ancient Olmecs form a family portrait of the men and women who even today work pray and live at the old sacred sites found in Veracruz and Tabasco.
