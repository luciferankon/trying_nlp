Jack has a tenor saxophone and he plays jazz. In the 1950s in the Belgian harbor town Antwerp there is not a lot off future for a jazz musician. Jack and his band try to earn a living by playing at weddings and the odd tea party usually resulting in mixed emotions and hilarious scenes. Most of the time he earns a living by unloading bananas in the Antwerp docks. Jack is convinced that New York is the place to be for a jazz musician but where will he get the money for the big trip? And what is more important: a woman or a saxophone?
