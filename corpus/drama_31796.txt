Stanley has never had a long list of friends in-fact he's rarely had any. Some say that the reason is because he's weird and socially awkward but the real reason is his deep love for tracking asteroids that has distanced Stanley from the rest of the world. What Stanley tracks isn't your average space junk but beautiful one timers the perfect trillion dollar rocks. When Stanley realizes that one of these beauties are headed towards earth he decides to create a blog to keep his viewing audience of zero in the loop with this outer motivation he won't let anything including bullying or his bad domestic life get in his way.
