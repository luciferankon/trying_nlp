Energy transition does not happen overnight - it is a step by step process. Steve Pomerance from Boulder Colorado built a solar home after learning about climate change in the 1970's. Since then he with a group of other concerned citizens and the city of Boulder have been paving the way for the city to go fossil free by 2030. Along the way they are pressuring the state and the utility to go green with them.
