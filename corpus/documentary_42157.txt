A makeshift secure psychiatric unit operates in Hungary's biggest refugee camp. The patients were rescued in 1992 during the Bosnian War from a local psychiatric institute. Since then they've been waiting persistently to return home. Their case seems to be sinking into oblivion down into the labyrinth of politics and bureaucracy. Then 17 years after the end of hostilities they can finally leave for home. Some of them could not live long enough to see the day. Others are so weak that they risk their lives in making the journey. But what is waiting for them back in their country? The makers of the film follow the tragic and heartbreaking story of the last victims of the war between 2003 and 2011.
