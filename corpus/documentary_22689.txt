THE WILD WORLD OF TED V. MIKELS a new documentary by Kevin Sean Michaels (no blood relation to Ted but the same spirit) is a rollicking look at the independent cinema and film pioneering of Ted V. Mikels who has been producing films for over 60 years. Way before limited-budget action films became termed as "grindhouse" Ted was wowing audiences with his own special brand of guts gore humor violence and most of all -- style. THE CORPSE GRINDERS 1 + 2 THE ASTRO-ZOMBIES 10 VIOLENT WOMEN MISSION: KILLFAST THE BLACK KLANSMAN THE DOLL SQUAD THE WORM EATERS and GIRL IN GOLD BOOTS are some of Ted's films that have made their cinematic mark. In one WILD WORLD documentary segment Ted demonstrates techniques of how to shoot an independent film. Superstar actress-model Masuimi Max and Black Betty (After Dark Films "Miss Horrorfest") work together with Ted as he shows them how a scene ought to be played with hilarious results. "I learned more with Ted in one day than I have in fifteen years of acting" admits Black Betty a.k.a. Jessica Chisum. Ted also reveals the secrets of his success and gives a rare inside look into his studio editing facilities and home. Ted shares stories of the trials and tribulations making it in the movie business the essence of showmanship and the days of living in a giant "castle" mansion with a harem of women.
