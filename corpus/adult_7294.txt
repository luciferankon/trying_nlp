Talent scout Riviera is out driving around when his Volkswagen Golf breaks down. Calling for help with barking dogs in the background he and the car are shortly in the garage. After repairs by muscular mechanic Riviera offers him a chance to dance with his Chippendales group. After having sex the mechanic agrees to come by for an audition. Arriving back home Riviera chats briefly with two of the dance company before heading upstairs for a nap. The two who were playing billiards continue their game and then make out. On the next day the budding talent heads for the audition leaving the garage and his fellow mechanics to get it on there. Once there Riviera introduces him to the choreographer and the twins. They all have sex. Then it's up to the mechanic to decide about the dance job. Will he take it or not?
