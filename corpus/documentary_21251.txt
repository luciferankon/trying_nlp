Ida's Story is a documentary that explores the effects of hatred and discrimination on the human spirit and the power of understanding and compassion to bring about change through the eyes of an 8-year-old child in 1918. Ida Sokoloff was 8 years old in 1918 when the Cossack soldiers came into her village in the Ukraine. That night the family of seven children fled with their father to make their way across Russia to seek freedom in America. When their father was killed six months later the children age 14 to six months old spent the next two years on a remarkable journey. With Ida's stories as the structure this documentary takes a modern look at how genocide happens and what we can do to make a difference.
