It's Emiel's 10th Birthday but he hides away in his tree house that looks out high over the Dutch countryside. The other members of the family do not tolerate this behavior and try to get Emiel down to celebrate. Instead the boy pulls up his rope-ladder. The increasingly more violent attempts to make Emiel change his mind all fail. Finally the angry dad goes completely overboard and takes measures that some will regret forever.
