A shopping cart filled with unhung art; Harry Potter memorabilia; vulva coloring books- these are the pieces of a life that surround Ela Darling adult film star. This view into her home and her world outside of porn presents an intimacy different from her usual on-camera roles yet one still presented through the lens of sex-inflected performance. Ela lives a seemingly unglamorous life as a self-professed introvert - walking her dog playing Dungeons and Dragons making quesadillas - but she also models nearly nude in fetish latex fashion shows as a favor for friends selects her watches from a massive collection gifted by a repeat client/fan with a watch fetish and is required to test for STDs bi-weekly as part of her job. The inextricable politics of representation and competing claims of objectification/exploitation versus feminist intervention/empowerment simmer beneath the surface of this visual ethnography that offers the quotidian as a point of divergence and potential decontextualization of the fetishized filmic place Ela typically occupies.
