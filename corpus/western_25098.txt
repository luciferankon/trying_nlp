The Range Busters head for Pinto Basin where a series of stage robberies have occurred. To try and find the gang's boss Crash sends out a empty money box. The plan backfires when the boss has the Range Busters identified as the robbers. Thinking it is now safe the bank sends out a big money shipment. Needing to rob the stage the boss gets the boys out of jail so they can be blamed. But this is just the chance they need to catch the robbers. The 3rd of the 24 "Range Buster" films from Monogram finds "Crash" Corrigan "Dusty" King and "Alibi" Terhune finding a letter on the body of Jim Matthews ordering him to go to Cottonwood to investigate a series of holdups which have cut Cottonwood off from the outside financial world seriously endangering an irrigation project. They decide to go in his place and then it gets even sillier than usual for a Range Buster film as Alibi loses their horses in a poker game while Crash and Dusty visit the local bank and Crash acting deaf-and-dumb - don't ask - until he discovers the bank president is Joan Brown. Local saloon owner Harvey is behind the outlaw activities with the Norton brothers Hank Lane and Joe as his hold-up henchies. Crash sets a trap by sending an empty strongbox out on the stage which backfires and results in the "Range Busters" being jailed by the Sheriff. But Harvey needs them to be free so they can be blamed for the next-day's robbery and has henchman Ware set them free. Crash has another plan which is the same as the first one that didn't work fifteen minutes earlier.
