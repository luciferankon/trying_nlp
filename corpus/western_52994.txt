The second of four films made by Resolute Productions Inc. that had Rex Bell Ruth Mix and Buzz Barton billed above the title and the basic plot is rather basic as the McGregor clan Ross Dan and Alex arch-enemies of Paradise Ranch owner Jerry Vance frame him on a murder charge and Danny Blake a young cowhand befriended by Jerry and Mary Vance an eastern girl who co-owns the ranch with Jerry help him clear his name... but the subplots provided by writer Eric Howard who taught a short-story writing class at the University of Southern California makes it play like a precursor to current soap operas on daytime television; Sally Moore staying at Jerry's ranch since her mother died because she thinks her stepfather Les Daggett displays an unhealthy attitude toward her causes some talk among the boys down at the saloon about her and Jerry who really loves Mary but Mary thinks he loves Sally so she listens to the oily talk of Dan who knows he has to get Jerry out of the way before he can have Mary. Deputy Lafe Hutchins is in love with Jane Dan's sister and is in league with Dan's plot to get rid of Jerry... to which end all hands including step-daddy Daggett kidnap Sally. Eric Howard wasn't called on much more to write a lot of westerns. The McGreggors are out to ruin rancher Jerry Dunbar and have planted their man Spud on his ranch to inform them of his cattle movements. When Jerry tries to sell his cattle they kill the buyer and blame Jerry. When they try to hang him he is rescued. But later he is captured again by the McGreggors and this time they plan to make sure they hang him.
