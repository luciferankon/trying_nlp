As a documentary director she has elevated the issue of domestic violence in such a way that we can no longer turn the other cheek or sweep this growing epidemic under the carpet. Let's Talk About It reveals the unstudied facet of domestic violence that is born in certain cultural and ethnic traditions and beliefs."
