A group of teenagers invent a game in which one of them is secretly chosen to be a "killer" while the others remain innocent victims. Armed with prop weapons the "killer" must eliminate the other players before being found out. To enhance their experience the teens sneak into a large self-storage warehouse during its closed late-night hours to hold their game. At first it's better than ever. But things take a horrific turn as one by one the players begin dying...for real.
