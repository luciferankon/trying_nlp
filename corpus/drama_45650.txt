CURTAIN CALL follows Emmett Tanner's plummet from the top of the country music charts to the bowels of state prison after a series of unfortunate events at a concert after-party leave one person dead and Tanner facing a murder charge. Filmed and set entirely in South Carolina the film follows Tanner's journey from the backwoods to center stage before heading off to the courthouse and penitentiary where the darkest chapters of Tanner's life play out. The feature-length drama stars Merritt Vann (Lt. Joe Kenda: Homicide Hunter Banshee Revolution Sleepy Hollow) as Emmett Tanner. Jennifer Wyatt (Snapped: Killer Couples Devious Maids) Pat Yeary (A Mother's Plea Army Wives The Signal) and Reno Gooch (ABC's of Death 2.5 Banshee) also star. Nashville recording artists The Blue Pickups provided original songs and much of the score. Band members Kelly Wyatt Mike Danielsen Donny Rogers and Jimmy Rogers also lend their acting talents as Emmett's on-screen band-mates with Wyatt as attorney Steve Bridges also leading Tanner's legal defense team. CURTAIN CALL grew out of a conversation Executive Producer Merritt Vann had with co-star Reno Gooch on the set of the Showtime hit "Banshee." After completing an initial screenplay for a short film Vann began working with writer/director Daljit Kalsi on plans for a feature film in late 2014 after collaborating with Kalsi on two previous films (Lord's Work and SINtenced). Thanks to partnerships with South Carolina Law Enforcement Agencies Kalsi and co-producers Vann and Kelly Wyatt took the cast and crew behind bars in working and former jail sites for much of the production adding to the film's authenticity and realism.
