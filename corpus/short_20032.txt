Mouka is a homeless 10-year-old mute boy who earns money by looking after bikes in a parking lot. He gives some of the money as an offering to his father's grave and some to a prison guard for his brother though the guard pockets it. In the same prison is a distraught woman holding a doll. She has been held there for two years and the female warden is pressuring the district attorney to release her. Mouka gets caught by the police when he is urged by other boys to try drugs and he also gets taken to the prison.
