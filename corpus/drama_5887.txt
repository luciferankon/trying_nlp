Strangeness' deals with the emotions and self estrangement within the home family friends and country. Family friends and environment within which we live is our personal home the small dwelling we created within which we feel secure tranquil and calm. The country to which one belongs is very much the womb which contains us all and envelops our small abodes. When the large home does not give a feeling of belonging then all of us feel a sense of strangeness and an absence of belonging. We therefore begin a journey of wandering in search for calm tranquility and security. A search for a large home that will contain our small home a search for a state that will contain us within its womb and peacefully envelope our small home.
