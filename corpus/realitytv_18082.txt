Gracie's friends is a half-hour animal rescue TV program from Sheffield Entertainment in Wilmington NC. The goal of Gracie's Friends is to showcase animals that need help in finding homes and a loving human to look after them. Each week we will showcase animals from different shelters that desperately need to be adopted! In today's world it is impossible to determine how many animals are in need but it's safe to say they number in the millions! Each week Gracie's Friends will feature veterinarians and animal trainers talking about the advantages of adopting and how to care for your new pet. Other segments will inform viewers about caring for your pet at home and overall wellness in animals.
