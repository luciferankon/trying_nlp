Tribute is a feature rockumentary about music's strangest subculture: tribute bands. Tribute bands go to extraordinary lengths to re-create the experience of rock supergroups like Kiss Journey Judas Priest and Queen. The result can be anything from an emotionally potent nostalgia trip to something more like Spinal Tap. Tribute follows the on- and off-stage struggles of tribute bands and their fans in their quest to live their rock dreams. Together they face band members quitting soul-sucking day jobs even bandmates who take the impersonation far too far.
