In a surprising twist to the legacy of the Stolen Generation an Aboriginal Elder re-buries his long-deceased uncle in 'country'. This is the story of one Indigenous family's search for reconnection - a generation after it was torn apart by an Australian government policy of forcibly removing Aboriginal children from their parents. We follow the journey of ailing Norm Brown who is embarking on a quest to right a wrong and return his Uncle Kitchener to 'Country' and the place from where he was stolen.
