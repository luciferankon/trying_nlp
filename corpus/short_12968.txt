The middle of nowhere sometime after an unnamed global catastrophe. Marge has a dream: Somebody's coming. She and Roger get ready for a visitor. Gordon shows up. He doesn't know them. They treat him to a feast. He appreciates their hospitality. At first he's modest and polite but he gradually grows more demanding. Marge kicks Roger out of the house. Marge and Gordon cozy up together roasting marshmallows over a crackling fire. Roger enjoys a cigar and the view from his new porch. Is it a dream or a curse?
