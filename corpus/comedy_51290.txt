An embarrassing blunder in the school library brings together Ollie and Emma two wide-eyed first-year university students. They connect instantly while their rambunctious companions collide like freight trains from opposite ends of the Canadian Pacific cultural spectrum. Emma is a smart determined First Nations woman on a mission to support her community; Ollie is a white guy just trying to figure out his place in the world. Their opposing perspectives become increasingly apparent as friends and families eagerly interfere with explosive results. But are Ollie and Emma really so different? Will social expectations and peer pressure ruin a perfectly awkward love story?
