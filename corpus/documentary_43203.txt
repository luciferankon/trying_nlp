Frank Towler is found dead in bed still dressed for his birthday party held earlier that afternoon. A plastic suicide bag and a farewell video are found at the scene. The doctor says Frank paralysed from Motor Neurone Disease could not have taken his own life. Frank's daughter Sister Ann-Marie a nun accuses Jacob Bashir her father's lover of seven years of killing him before the Will was changed in her favour. Murder? Assisted suicide? Two separate juries simultaneously assess the evidence.
