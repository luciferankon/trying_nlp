In Hiroshima contrary to local people's wish violence and disturbance are shown up especially on August 6th. Protesters demonstrators and religious groups occupied Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park entirely taking advantage of that place for their campaigns. The heart of peace in Hiroshima is no longer at peace. Even though media also regularly come to picture they are obliged to capture precisely the peaceful images of Hiroshima. They just sit down in front of miserable or mourning people and organize grief reactions to integrate themselves into Hiroshima Peace Memorial Day. Most casual viewers of media will follow those artificial pieces so that there this is a peace gap between media images and the actual situation in Hiroshima. This gap is what represents Hiroshima culture 70 years after the bomb was dropped. The shots in Above the Ground reveal how this is happening and why this exists. To do so we filmed using 15 cameras applying the methods of visual ethnography. These methods help viewers develop their spiritual and intellectual muscles to the point where they can acquire accurate knowledge of Hiroshima culture. The film has abandoned the historical analogy of Hiroshima city and instead selected pieces that fairly represent the various dimensions of contemporary Hiroshima. No one need be rigidly committed to any single approach to the film. Ultimately the documentary offers audiences different paths toward peace culture of Hiroshima.
