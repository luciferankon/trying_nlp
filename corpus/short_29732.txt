What happens when a female Polish capitalist meets two lazy Danish welfare state boys? On a job-activation trip to Poland Jens meets Renata. One day she turns up at his doorstep in Copenhagen carrying a huge suitcase. She moves in and they start up a relationship. But Renata soon finds out that Jens doesn't do much apart from fishing drinking beer and dreaming of his big breakthrough - a nice and easy life financed by the state. But Renata has other plans.
