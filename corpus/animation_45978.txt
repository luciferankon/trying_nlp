Fireman Sam (Welsh: Sam TÃ¢n) is a Welsh animated children's television series about a fireman called Sam his fellow firefighters and other townspeople in the Welsh town of Pontypandy (a portmanteau of two real towns Pontypridd and Tonypandy which are situated approximately 5 miles apart in the South Wales valleys). The original idea for the show came from two ex-firemen from Kent. They took their idea to artist/writer Rob Lee who developed the concept for them. The finished concept was then presented to S4C who saw the potential in the series and commissioned it.
