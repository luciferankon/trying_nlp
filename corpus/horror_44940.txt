F13: No Man's Land is a thrilling new FAN FILM venture which returns us to the terrifying world of Jason Voorhees and the chilling area he calls home Crystal Lake. When a group of youngsters accompanied by two road travellers find themselves stumbling accidently into the now abandoned realm of the infamous and long since gone Camp it isn't long before they are picked off one by one by someone who isn't too happy to have been disturbed. Shot entirely in the United Kingdom F13: No Man's Land brings Jason back once more to unleash bloody terror just in time for Halloween 2010.
