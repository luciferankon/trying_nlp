Imagine a world where coming to church on Sunday was against the law; where owning a Bible could get you arrested; where sharing the gospel with someone who does not know Jesus could get you killed. Imagine a world where friends and family members could one day simply not come home without any explanation. They just disappear. Where people you think you know could turn out to be informants and betray you. Imagine a world where your property assets and belongings can be taken from you without recourse simply because you call yourself a Christian; where the police and government turn a blind eye to your suffering. This is the plight of the persecuted church. This is reality for Christians in places like China Indonesia Pakistan Sudan Nigeria Cuba Saudi Arabia and many other places. This is an attempt to bring into sharp focus the plight of the Christian church.
