Marcelo (Adriŕ Collado) a TV advert scriptwriter hasn't been paid for three months. Kiko (Eric Francés) has just been fired from the video-shop where he was working. They both share a rented flat and they are broke. The solution to their problems is to re-rent a room - but they only have a wardrobe. Soto (Fernando Tejero) an unemployed actor doesn't mind living in a closet. He also has ideas that would really solve their problems.
