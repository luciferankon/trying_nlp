These Walls Can Talk is a complex and poignant story about St Josephs School for Deaf Boys a school that stood at the heart of the Irish Deaf community for over 150 years. It is where Ireland's indigenous sign language was developed and where the foundation of the modern Irish Deaf community was built and while it offered incredible opportunity to some Deaf boys for others that opportunity came at an unspeakable price.In this powerful film Performance Artist Amanda Coogan returns to St Joseph's to re-evaluate her perceptions of this iconic building and to decide in the wake of its demolition how it should be remembered.
