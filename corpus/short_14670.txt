The makers call the film an "Artern" a combination of art film and western. A playful and consciously puzzling poetic treatise of the idiots and "exoten" in the art world. The "Artern" is obviously not a film about art but a work of art in itself. An artwork made with the raving nonsense often vented by connoisseurs.
