In 1590 the Diet of Augsburg ruled that gypsies were the spawn of Satan and therefore had no rights whatsoever. The ruling allowed Christians to kill gypsies without penalty which sparked the church to organize a small group of religious assassins to carry out the dirty work. Unfortunately the band of killer priests were not informed that the gypsies had made a pact of protection with a powerful werewolf clan so all hell broke loose. Four hundred years later the bloody war between the church gypsies and werewolves rages on and it's up to a small-town police chief to end it or die trying. In the 1500's the Diet Of Augsburg ruled that Christians could kill Gypsies without penalty. It was also the year of The Werewolf Trials. Being the subjects of severe persecution the Gypsies and Werewolves formed a pact of protection... sparking a war against the church that's lasted 400 years. Now... all HELL is about to break loose.
