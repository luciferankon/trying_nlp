'Just Left of the Drama' chronicles the rise and fall of a relationship between two alcoholics and their subsequent redemption. James though sober for a year is stuck within himself and Kelly is running from a crumbled marriage seeking to escape her abusive past. Together they start anew but it's not long before the past comes echoing back to destroy the refuge they've found in each other and threatens to drag them back down into certain destruction -- something only divine intervention could deliver them from.
