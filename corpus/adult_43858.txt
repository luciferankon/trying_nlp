A young couple who is having problems with their marital/sex life visit an Indian 'guru' at his reserve and ask him for help. He then educates them on the various aspects of lovemaking as described in the ancient Indian texts of Vatsayana's 'Kama Sutra'. Many of the situations and positions are demonstrated onscreen by different performers in vignettes. After they have been guided through the ancient sex-manual (not all of the book is covered here and not in graphic detail anyway) the couple leave enlightened. But before they get in their car they stop near some bushes on the premises and proceed to make love in the open. The guru's maid (seen in the background in some scenes) comes upon them and joins in the fun (this scene is a bit more graphic then the previous ones). The guru himself appears later and eyes the trio with a benevolent smile before moving on.
