Cattle man Darnell has been killed and the sheep men blamed. The Cheyenne Kid arrives and joins up with the Darnell's who are trying to drive the sheep men off the range. But he soon comes to believe the sheep men are innocent and it's not long before the real murderer is revealed and the Kid goes into action. Reb alias the Cheyenne Kid (Reb Russell) wanted for murder and train robbery takes a hand in a range war between cattle and sheep raisers. He helps Seth Darnell (Lafe McKee) and his daughter Jane (Victoria Vinton) when young Jim Darnell (Winton Perry) is a heavy loser at cards to Pete Lang(Edmund Cobb.) Reb wins back the money from Lang at the latter's Golden Nest Saloon and later proves him to be the head of the gang causing all of the trouble between the ranchers.Reb informs Jane that he is really a U.S.Marshal working undercover and is not a wanted outlaw. An uncredited Smiley Burnette(recently arrived in Hollywood) who knew Reb Russell when he was a star football player at Northwestern when Smiley was a performer at Chicago's WLS radio wrote and sung the song "Reb and His Pal Rebel" under the opening credits.
