This Pete Smith Specialty shows newsreel footage events that live up to the title. They include among others a diaper derby (the father who puts a diaper on his child fastest wins) a fireman's ball (two teams of fire fighters use high-pressure water hoses to move a large ball to score goals) and a basket race (men run a footrace while balancing a "tower" of ten baskets on their heads).
