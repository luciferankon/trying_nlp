Composer Antonín Dvorák ('Josef Vinklár' (qv)) conducts a rehearsal at the Royal Albert Hall in London where a series of his musical pieces is to be performed. He is suddenly being haunted by a vicious feeling expressed by four tones f-ges-e-f. He decides to immediately return back home with his wife Anna ('Jana Hlavácková' (qv)). On the train back home he immerses in his long forgotten memories. Fifteen years ago when he was a violinist at a theatre orchestra he got fascinated by the beauty and performance of an actress Josefina Cermáková ('Jana Hlavácová' (qv)). Being captivated by her appearance he carried on playing even after the orchestra had finished. Josefina got later married to Earl Kounic ('Svatopluk Benes' (qv)) and her younger sister Anna married Dvorák.
