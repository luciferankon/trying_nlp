There is a Hero in each one of us. Hero doesn't mean broad shoulders muscles. or funky dance moves. Hero is the one who has courage and compassion. Hero doesn't stay silent and takes a stand. Our hero in this case is a girl in her mid-twenties. She is a girl you see every day. She is just an ordinary girl. What makes her extraordinary is her courage to stand up for something she loves and believes in. She feeds stray dogs every day which makes her and her furry friends a subject of ridicule for some local people. And when she finds out that the rogues are planning something more than just harassing them with their sharp words she decides to stand up for their friends. After all that is what a hero does. She did it. Will you or I do it?
