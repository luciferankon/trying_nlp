America's It Girl is a two-cycle 12-episode competition show that inspires dynamic and determined young women to build a brand for themselves by creating a more beautiful self both inside and out. The dual competition takes place in New York City and in Los Angeles and will spread across country in its second season. Currently over 400 young women from both coasts are competing in pre-show competitions preparing to seek the title of "America's It Girl." During the course of the show we root for these young women as they improve their looks their health and fitness and their career plans by experiencing the America's IT Girl competition phases. We watch their triumphs and disappointments as they navigate their way through the world of fashion competitions aiming to win over $100000 in prizes for themselves and their charities launch their modeling career and bring out their own name brand of clothing and gear. The show premieres Sundays starting in Fall 2014 and runs through the New Year in 2015 when the final fashion competition determines America's IT Girl - a young woman with power glamour beauty and that special indefinable quality 'IT' - we guarantee you'll know IT when you see it!
