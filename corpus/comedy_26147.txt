This summer was supposed to be simple. Playing video games eating junk food and sleeping were the only plans on Chris's agenda. That was until he met Trevor. Now he's forced to spend the next three months with his least favorite person in the world. Someone who lies and someone who poops his pants. With his Mom taking Trevor's side on most everything Chris does whatever he can to make the best out of this summer even with Trevor standing in his way of that.
