To present five different contemporary stories involving different characters as one feature film. What these stories have in common is their expression of the way relational dysfunction prompts people to enact physical and/or emotional violence against themselves each other or society. This common theme may be represented by a physical object or act that is not necessarily relevant to the plot but which serves as a visual metaphor for the challenges facing different characters in different situations who are confronted by the same problems.
