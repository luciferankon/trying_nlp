Sex Drugs and Hospitality is the 1st of its kind. A feature length documentary that tells a story from the service industry's point of view. We will show you all of those things that hit a little too close to home; from Pet Peeves to perks to all the realities that come with working in the industry. Moral of the story: we believe everyone should work AT LEAST one shift in the industry and the world would be a much nicer place.
