1980's Los Angeles was a tense era in the bizarre lifeline of the sun dappled bliss of southern California. Crime was up the music scene was hot and the nights were on fire. The surfers and skate kids ran the beach fronts the rich kids went to school and the malls and the street gangs stepped up from toe-to-toe fights into straight-up gun warfare. Nobody was safe but everybody was living the sunny dream. "Dangerous Type" follows these three different cliques shifting from then to now. Cold cases family losing touch maturing and fates you can't change good or bad.
