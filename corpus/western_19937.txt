In the wild wild west Ramona Alvarez and her perpetually stoned nurse run into five gay cowboys. The seven members of the party desire a handsome male drifter except for the transvestite sheriff who can't be bothered about anything but his outfit. All hot & bothered at this point the cowboys rape Ramona who subsequently has sex with the drifter and in the afterglow of sex wants to form a suicide pact with him. The drifter rejects her new desire and rides off into the sunset with another man.
