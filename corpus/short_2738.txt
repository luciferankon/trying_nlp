The lurid wedding of a black man and white girl with a Ku Klux Klansman performing the wedding ceremony. John Waters' first film made on 8mm given one showing (making back its budget of thirty dollars) before being retired to his closet. This film is about a black man and a white girl's wedding on a rooftop. He courts her by carrying her around in a trash can and chooses a Ku Klux Klansman to perform the wedding. The wedding guests are played by people dressed in early pop-influenced costumes such as American flags and tinfoil. Mary Vivian Pearce does a dance known as the bodie green. This early Waters short is about a white ballerina who gets into a car with a black man that is inside a trash can. They are joined by a drag queen and some other female character. The ballerina and the black man then proceed to get wed by a Klansman.
