After the Second World War the defeated Italy has to agree terms with the victors: the whole of Istria is ceded to Yugoslavia including the coastal towns of the Quarnero (Kvarner) and the Dalmatian province of Zara (Zadar) where the Italians had always been the majority of the population. With the redefinition of the borders much of the Italian population of the peninsula decides to abandon their homes. Their exodus radically redraws the demographic map of the area. Out of the 32000 inhabitants of Pula 29000 people set off. But there are Italians who decide to stay. These are mostly those with neither the strength nor the opportunity to escape plus the followers of the new power. They are the "wrong Italians" as Pier Antonio Quarantotti Gambini writer and Istrian refugee calls them in Radio Venezia Giulia. This documentary is a journey through the lives and words of some of the most representative writers of the Italian language that still inhabit this land trying to keep alive the Italian culture.
