EAST OF SALINAS is a documentary about immigration childhood and the cruelty of circumstance. An undocumented 3rd grader dreams of becoming an engineer. As deportation and gang violence threaten his future this bighearted ambitious boy begins to understand what it really means to be "born in Mexico.' Jose Anzaldo is Oscar Ramos' most gifted student. Jose's parents work in the lettuce fields. He's been in seven schools in three years and he shares his one bedroom apartment with another family. But how do you teach students like Jose who have no place to do their homework? How do you teach a kid who moves every few months? This is what Oscar is up against every day. Oscar not only teaches his students reading math and science he gives them access to a world beyond their reach. EAST OF SALINAS was shot over three years. As the nation debates immigration reform what happens to Jose tells a deeper story about America in the early 21st century.
