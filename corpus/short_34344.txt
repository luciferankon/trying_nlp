In the near-future after an economic collapse two southwestern teenagers find themselves trapped by a depression that has consumed America. Here men have given up looking for work and instead spend their time hiding in the shadows of the local motel. Brooke 17 is a hard working maid at the crumbling Monument Motel. She tends to the men that reside here - too beaten down to hope for anything more. Her best friend Weasel 17 is a troublemaker who spends her time scheming up ways to escape town. The story takes off when Brooke and Weasel steal a car. Together they come face to face with predators on the outskirts of town. They're set onto a hunt for fuel both literally and figuratively; fighting to escape no matter what stands in their way.
