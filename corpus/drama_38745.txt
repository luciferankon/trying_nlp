In 'Scattered Explorations' two artists meet at a time of transition when their old ways of thinking and creating no longer appeal to them and they are looking for something new something different and something revolutionary. They use each other as a form of connection between their previous ways of thinking and doing and what they hope to be their new ways of thinking and doing. 'Scattered Explorations' is about the time between; the analysis of a pending revolution.
