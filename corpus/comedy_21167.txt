On the last night of the fiscal quarter Dennis Shenanigan's manager will be promoted to district manager if they have a $9000 day. To motivate the crew he tells them the restaurant will close if they don't meet this goal. His competition is next door: Ta-Ta's a bar with scantily clad waitresses managed by the newly self-confident Calvin. At Ta-Ta's it's Allison's first day; she's nervous. At Shenanigan's Mason a cook is trying his best to be cool without success. As the shift wears on each employee faces his worst fears and Dennis tries to learn how to attract women. Next door Calvin and Allison make self discoveries. It all ends at the post-shift party.
