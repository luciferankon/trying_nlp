The tranquil lagoon-side town Knysna on the South African coast is hardly the setting one would expect for high stakes international crime. But in the summer of 2010 the town was the scene of the biggest drug haul in South Africa's history. In early December 2010 a trio of businessmen is renting a luxury apartment in the heart of the Knysna Quays. The men are planning a trip on their boat the Toledo a 42 foot luxury sport fisher. On Friday December 5 the Toledo leaves the marina on a trip into the deep blue. She returns five days later heavily laden. When suspicious police officers search the boat they find nearly two tons of pure uncut cocaine.
