In 2004 former Band drummer Levon Helm eager to get back into playing music on a regular basis after surviving a bout with cancer began staging a series of small concerts at the recording studio on his estate in Woodstock New York. Calling the shows "The Midnight Rambles" a different set of guests tagged along once or twice a month while Helm and his cronies played house band and on October 23 2004 Helm set up with guitarist Fred Scribner bassist Michael Merritt and blues man Little Sammy Davis on vocals and harmonica. Like the other shows in the Midnight Ramble series the gig was recorded and videotaped and The Midnight Ramble Music Sessions Vol. 1 features 12 songs from that evening.
