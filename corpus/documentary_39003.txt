Rhino Wars (a.k.a. Rhino Trade Uncover) goes undercover to explore organized crime's role in the illicit trade of rhino horn. We follow the activities of the Xasavang syndicate tracking the multi million US$ illicit wildlife trade from South Africa to its headquarters in Laos.

With the tipping point for saving the species rapidly approaching new techniques in ranger training plans to take the fight to the poachers.
