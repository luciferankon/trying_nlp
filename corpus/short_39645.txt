By the Gordon Highlanders. In the foreground are two Creusot guns manned by the Dutch burghers. Smoke effects are due. The Highlanders are seen in the distance approaching rapidly easily distinguished by their kilts and bare legs. They sweep all before them leaving the guns smoking and deserted as they pursue the flying Boers.
