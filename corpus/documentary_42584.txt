After recording the lives of Hong Kong's children in Fish Story (HKAFF 2013) Director JC Wong turns his camera to matters of life and death in his new documentary. For two years Wong documented the lives of three families that are struggling to live beneath the torment of terminal illness. Over time the subjects begin to rethink their ideas of death and filial obligations over visits to nursing homes hospitals and even funeral homes. Commissioned by the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals this gentle and devastatingly humanistic work shows the importance of love and companionship when we come face-to-face with mortality.
