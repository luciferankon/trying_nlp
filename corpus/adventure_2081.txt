When an art thief steals a small statuette his friend turns him in. The idol has special powers however and they include the power to magically bind and gag women in the same room. Every time the women manage to free themselves the idol causes them to be bound and gagged even more severely. Will the ladies manage to free themselves before the thief returns for his booty?
