All 4x4's go off road but the FJ Cruiser takes you off the off road and into the rugged remote no man's lands where tarmac is a distant memory. In this spot we highlight the FJ's natural home at the end of the beaten track pioneering new territory where others fear to tread. Directed by Jeff Zwart this half hour TV show asks what would happen if you took two average guys and dropped them in the middle of the Australian outback with only an FJ Cruiser to get them back to civilisation? The series of webfilms and TV special follows them through some of Australia's most inhospitable and spectacular country as they battle the elements to reach their destination.
