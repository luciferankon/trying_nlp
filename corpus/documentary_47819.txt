AirForce One The original Boeing aircraft that transported Eight different American Presidents has been de-commissioned. This noble plane is due to become a permanent exhibit at The Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley California. However in order to accomplish this task the Plane must be completely dismantled and transported to the construction site; it's wings separated from the fuselage and a building constructed around the pieces. Using a combination of "Up to the Minute" digital technology and traditional timelapse photography The Production team will document this unique procedure. The Project will include interviews with Former Presidents and a celebrity Narrator.
