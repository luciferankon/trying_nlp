A child Mary Sunshine filled with a desire to play with other youngsters was forbidden to do so by her mother. But one day Piggy a young negro child appeared over the top of the fence and the temptation was too great. From that day on Mary was given to running off with Piggy. As punishment for her first offense she was sent to bed without supper but neither her father nor mother could sleep when they realized that Mary was hungry so they caught each other bringing food to the youngster. On a nearby estate lived Daniel Graham rich alone and grouchy. To him came the awakening when he heard the laugh of a child. Looking over the fence to locate the laugh he found Mary and Piggy encouraging a chicken fight. From then on day after day the child visited him and brought cheer to the big mansion which had never known the sound of childish laughter. On the off days when not at the big house Mary and Piggy ran wild for ways in which to make passersby lose their seriousness and smile. Not aware of the friendship of the child for the rich man Mary's father in order to make up for foolish ventures on the stock market attempted to rob the big house. This same evening Mary remained at the house after her birthday party given her by Daniel Graham. Being restless in her sleep from so many good things to eat Mary started downstairs to frighten her friend but instead she walked in the big room just as her father was in the midst of his attempted wrongdoing.
