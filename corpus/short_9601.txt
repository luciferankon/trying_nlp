Foreclosure a 20-minute 16mm film co-produced with the small town of Milan in west central Minnesota as a political statement tells the story of a 1982 family losing their farm to foreclosure during the farm crisis. Through the memories of one old farmer we flash back to a 1930's penny auction when populists foiled foreclosures by bidding just pennies and nickels for every item that came up for bid. Banks were forced to accept the meager proceeds and the people then gave everything back to the family so they could stay on the land.
