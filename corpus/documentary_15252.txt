A derelict coal mine a tramway depot a small ready-made clothing workshop of a former fashion house a dairy factory and a world of women who lived their youth in communism. In capitalism they work in difficult conditions but they do not complain. Their simple and humane stories form a complicated historical puzzle. Routine frustration the fear that they may become expendable and could lose their jobs make these women resist heroically and live their destinies like beasts of burden. They had dreams and ideals once. Now they have but one wish: to live long enough to enjoy their retirement. Historical dramas are not always performed at a big scale. Worlds collapse and there are collateral victims. During communism the 8th of March was the high day when women were celebrated as representatives of the working class.
