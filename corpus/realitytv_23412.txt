Follow the lives loves and interpersonal relationships of gay gold medal-winning basketball team The Rockdogs. The San Francisco team is trying to come back together after disbanding in 2006 struggling to overcome their differences off the court and working together as a team to prove they're still the champs. Action on the court is rivaled by off-the-court action as some of the players live together party bicker and hook up. As these twenty something multi-ethnic athletes make a boys to men journey they learn not only the importance of teamwork but help redefine the meaning of family.
