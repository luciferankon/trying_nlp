In the middle of the night a handsome young man struggles with insomnia a result of receiving prank phone calls. As he falls in and out of sleep he has three different erotic dreams: a tryst with a hunk in a 1950's suburban backyard pool; an erotic yet disturbing vampire sequence and a voyeuristic four-way with French sailors set in the 1940's (an homage to Jean Genet).
