Friendships come and go. Imagine however a friendship that has lasted 75 years. Now imagine 15 of them. Remarkably these friends met in kindergarten at Public School 80 in the Bronx New York in 1936. In 2001 the award-winning short film "The Bronx Boys - Hosted by Carl Reiner" captured their 70th birthday reunion. Because of the film the men gained many new friends after its broadcasts on PBS and Cinemax and subsequently from being the subjects of a story in TIME Magazine. This new film hosted once again by Carl Reiner catches-up with The Bronx Boys ten years later as they gathered together to celebrate their 80th birthdays and a lifetime of friendship. A few things had changed. They might have lost a step or two and some of the boys were missing but they were no less energetic revisiting their youth for an afternoon of wacky games and wild rides at an amusement park. And they were no less candid funny and insightful when talking about the past the present and the future. All of The Bronx Boys went on to successful careers ranging from a university professor to an attorney to business owners. One fascinating thing however is how many of them went on to careers in the entertainment industry including Joel Coler who was a marketing executive with Twentieth Century Fox; Lenny Lauren (designer Ralph Lauren's brother) who is an executive with Polo; John Herman Shaner who is a screenwriter (including Last Married Couple In America); and George Shapiro & Howard West who were the executive producers of the Emmy Award winning show Seinfeld. The film is filled with an abundance of fun laughs memories insights and sage advice for those of all ages. It's a smile-inducing tribute to long-lasting friendships: funny uplifting inspiring life-affirming. You'll enjoy meeting The Bronx Boys.
