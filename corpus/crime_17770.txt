A sleuth hounding the truth for his high school newspaper... A bully with a heart of gold constantly manipulated by forces outside of his control... An outcast with a mean left hook made a pariah for being a girl with too many rough edges... Their stories intertwine and align inside MSGR. O'Mallory High School. A place where teens take their problems way too seriously.
