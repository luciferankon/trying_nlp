Set in Tulsa Oklahoma-home of legendary televangelist Oral Roberts--Unlikely Family depicts a progressive church family coming together in the most unlikely of places. The film follows a group of people rejected by mainstream churches society their families and their jobs because of divorce sexuality and ignorance of religion. The movie demonstrates what people faced in 1995 and still face today when they don't fit the mold prescribed by biblical "clobber scriptures." The film challenges traditional "my way or the highway" views of salvation that straitjacket lives with narrow values and ideals.
