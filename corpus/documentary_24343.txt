Marc Emery Canada's most prominent marijuana activist popularly known as the "Prince of Pot" faces extradition to the U.S. and a possible life sentence for selling marijuana seeds. ''Prince of Pot'' follows the controversial self-made leader of the marijuana movement as he attempts to raise an army of pot activists and lead them into battle against the U.S. Federal Government and their drug enforcement police the D.E.A.
