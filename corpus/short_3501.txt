This picture is a reproduction of a clever vaudeville act and the numerous astonishing tricks are perfectly legitimate inasmuch as the ingenuity of trick photograph; is in no way an aid to the clever juggler who performs some wonderful tricks in full view of the audience. We see the performer who is a genius in his art enter upon the stage and proceed to remove his gloves and coat while he balances his silk hat on the tip of his nose. He next does some extremely difficult tricks with a number of coins which he throws in the air catching them on his forehead after which he lets them slide into the socket of his eye holding them like so many monocles. He then releases them one by one letting them fall into his hand. Finally he concludes his performance by juggling three hats catching them upon his head without a miss.
