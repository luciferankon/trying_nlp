This adaptation of the famous short story by Rudyard Kipling tells the story of Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnahan two ex-soldiers in India when it was under British rule. They decide that the country is too small for them so they head off to Kafiristan in order to become Kings in their own right. Kipling is seen as a character that was there at the beginning and at the end of this glorious tale. " The Man Who Would Be King" is about two ambitious ex-soldiers stationed in India who set out to become the rulers of an entire country. After finishing their tour of duty in India Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan have decided that India is "too small for the likes of them" so they decide to bribe a local ruler and extort money from him in order to buy twenty Martini rifles which they will use to take over villages in Kafristan. They face many challenges and perils along the way including difficult terrain hostile natives freezing temperatures and an avalanche high in the mountains. They eventually come to a small village Urheb where they meet Ootah and Billy Fish an Indian who speaks English; he then becomes their translator. They then train the natives of this village to use the rifles and soon conquer village after village. During a battle Daniel is struck by an arrow that seemingly sticks out of his chest. The ignorant natives believe that he must be a God for not having died and fall down and begin worshiping him. Daniel and Peachy decide that it would be easier for a "God " to take over the country so they pretend that Daniel is a god the son of Alexander the Great who has returned after 2200 years to again rule Kafristan. The entire country celebrated the return of their new ruler the Son of Segunda ("Alexander"). As a token of their admiration the holiest of holy men gives Daniel all of the gold and riches left by Alexander in 328 B.C. It is enough to make them the richest men in the world . . . All goes well until Daniel's ego and greed gets the best of him. He asks Peachy to bow when he walks in front of him. He later tells Peachy that he has decided to stay and now believes that he is the son of Alexander ( 'in spirit anyways") and that to fulfill his destiny he will marry Roxanne like his "father" Alexander did before him. The Kafiri's believe that a mortal cannot marry a God but Daniel goes ahead anyway. Peachy was set to leave with his share of the treasure but Daniel convinced him to stay " for old time's sake" for the wedding. At the ceremony Roxanne believing that she would soon die bites Daniel drawing blood. The entire crowd realizes that since Danny is bleeding that he is a man not a God and that he has been deceiving them the entire time. Peachy grabs Daniel and they run off with their twenty soldiers shooting at the crowd of monks who set out to kill them. They are eventually captured and Daniel is forced to walk out on a rope bridge. The monks cut the ropes and Daniel bravely falls to his death. Peachy is later crucified; when they come to see him the next day he is still alive and they say that it is a miracle that he lived and they cut him down. He eventually climbs down into the valley and retrieves Danny's head still wearing the crown. He brings it back to Rudyard Kipling a writer for the Northern Star as proof that Daniel accomplished his goal and became the King of Kafristan.

Peachy explains how they nearly died in the mountains found an expedition's Gurkha sole survivor took charge of a tribe and started conquering. Then a freakish arrow incident lead the natives to believe Danny invulnerable hence Sikander the long-expected divine son of Alexander the Great and therefore made him theocratic king of all Kafiristan. But even if ruling went surprisingly well living up to a god's expectation pattern didn't.
