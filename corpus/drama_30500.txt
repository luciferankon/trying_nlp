In Russia's factory region during Czarist rule there's restlessness and strike planning among workers; management brings in spies and external agents. When a worker hangs himself after being falsely accused of thievery the workers strike. At first there's excitement in workers' households and in public places as they develop their demands communally. Then as the strike drags on and management rejects demands hunger mounts as does domestic and civic distress. Provocateurs recruited from the lumpen and in league with the police and the fire department bring problems to the workers; the spies do their dirty work; and the military arrives to liquidate strikers. Laborers at a locomotive factory go on strike to protest harsh working conditions. Management rejects their demands and decides to break the strike by any means necessary.
