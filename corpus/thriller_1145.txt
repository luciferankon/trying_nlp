It is the early 2000s and KIM'S soldier brother ORENTHAL is returning from Afghanistan after more than a year as a kidnap victim. She waits anxiously for his return so he can save her from the aliens posing as their parents. They look the same as their parents sound smell and behave the same-but they are not the same. They are imposters. The aliens have stolen her parents and she knows they want to do the same to her. Orenthal eventually returns from war alive and intact. And to Kim's horror she realizes the aliens have taken her brother from her as well and replaced him with a copy.
