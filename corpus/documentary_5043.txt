Frank Lloyd Wright is an American icon - it's most famous modern architect and probably it's most prolific - over 400 buildings in a 60-year career. But his most revealing constructions are his houses revolutionary in their open plan design and conceived as an expression of Wright's philosophy of a perfect harmony between man and nature: 'organic architecture' as he called it.
