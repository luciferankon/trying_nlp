On march 29 1945 about sixty Hungarian Jewish forced laborers are shot dead by three SS men in the village of Deutsch-Sch√ºtzen in the Austrian province of Burgenland. One of the alleged murderers is SS junior squad leader Adolf Storms who has never been held account-able for the act. 63 years after the crime Walter Manoschek manages to interview him. In conversations with Storms HJ leaders who were accessories of the crime and Jews who survived the massacre the crime is reconstructed and questions are asked about forgetting repression and responsibility.
