Three flatmates in Mexico City face uncertainties: Luc√≠a who has a great job as an art director for TV commercials is abusing alcohol and cocaine. She risks losing her job going to prison for assault and she's woefully in love with a bullfighter who may be two-timing her. Carmen an artist without income can be manic - snorting lots of cocaine and hanging out with a gay man and a transvestite. What's her future? Hanna contemplates divorce from Abraham a wealthy momma's boy and she's disoriented by feelings of attraction to Sandra a customer at her jewelry store. Can any of these poor little rich girls sort things out in a world of excess?
