Amy has a seemingly perfect life - a great marriage over-achieving kids a beautiful home and a career. However she's overworked over-committed and exhausted to the point that she's about to snap. Fed up she joins forces with two other over-stressed moms on a quest to liberate themselves from conventional responsibilities - going on a wild un-mom-like binge of long overdue freedom fun and self-indulgence - putting them on a collision course with PTA Queen Bee Gwendolyn and her clique of devoted perfect moms. Amy is a hard-working mom. Between caring for her two children shuttling them to activities and having to pick up the slack for her lazy husband she works at a company filled with millennials who have no work ethic or clue about her life. Even more unproductive is all the nonsense she has to endure just to be a "good mom". In particular PTA meetings and other PTA functions. This leaves her no time for relaxation or just to be herself. One day she rebels against the system and decides to let go ditching all the unnecessary bs in her life. This gains her some friends among the other moms - two in particular Carla and Kiki - but pits her against the President of the PTA Gwendolyn James who is a nasty piece of work.
