There is a growing divide between those who serve and those for whom their service benefits. Raising awareness and funding is very hard and creating the conversations surrounding it is just as difficult. This adventure engages the audience through a series of media and represents our thanks for the will and drive of our veterans and first-responders that continue to protect us. AN 18-MONTH MEDIA SERIES. ONE EXTREME EVENT. The Birds Eye View Project is an 18-month adventure series & documentary that will chronicle the epic extreme-sports journey of wounded veteran and former Navy SEAL Ryan "Birdman" Parrott to assist in bringing funding and awareness to veteran & first responder charities.
