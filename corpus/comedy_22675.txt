Honey Skinner is proud of her successful husband. When he tells her he's going to ask for a raise she knows he'll get it. He asks his boss just as their big client announces he's not renewing his contract. He doesn't get the raise but he's too embarrassed to tell his wife the truth. She starts making plans to spend that extra $10 a week; the first thing is a new dress suit for him and a new outfit for her so they can fit in at a swanky party. They're the hit of the party and Honey is embraced by the 'smart set.' Meanwhile business is bad and Skinner loses his job. The tailor is after him for payment on the suit and Honey is still spending the salary he doesn't have.
