At the beginning of the 20th century the Austrian philosopher and social thinker Rudolf Steiner questions the future of agriculture. To him the traditional system is doomed to failure and can only lead to the generation of seeds and to decline in the quality of products. In answer to a question about plant diseases Rudolf Steiner explained that in reality it was not the plant first but the environment and more particularly the soil which could become sick. The origin of the plants' alleged diseases were to be found in the state of the soil and the environment. Rudolf Steiner's quotes: "Biodynamic agriculture is an agriculture ensuring the health of soil and plants to provide healthy food for animals and men. It is based on a thorough understanding of the laws of life gained by a qualitative view of the global nature. It believes that nature is now so degraded that it no longer able to heal itself and it is necessary to restore the soil vitality essential for the health of plants animals and people trough therapeutic processes. The world of wine has rapidly come to understand the stake of this agriculture the loss of the notion of soil being more important in wine making than in other agricultural productions. Wine growers elaborate their wines extreme accuracy from their vineyards to their cellars and it's a job where each and every detail has its importance. Biodynamic farming has widely developed thank's to the rigor and precision of these charismatic characters who pass on their knowledge with great passion.
