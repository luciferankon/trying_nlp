Live action TV series based on Disney's classic Dumbo an elephant with the ability to fly (with the help of his trusty feather). The characters were all costumes (with the help of 'puppetronics' I believe radio-controlled mechanisms pioneered by Jim Henson's "Fraggle Rock" and Disney's "Welcome to Pooh Corner". This series didn't produce too many episodes but ran for quite a while and was pretty popular for a cable series.
