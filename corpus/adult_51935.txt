Three office workers are captured bound and gagged by a mysterious woman who is very efficient with knots. The girls manage to escape however rather than call the police or leave the premises they decide to give their captor a taste of her own medicine. Unfortunately for the shapely lassies their plan backfires spectacularly and soon all four women are seated on a couch swathed with rope and silenced with tape or cloth.
