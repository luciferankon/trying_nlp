Two centuries ago in dangerous times a prudent young smuggler is deeply in love with a wild yet mindful woman who lives alone in her dead father's house. He battles against ill health and she struggles with all the uncertainties. They swear they will never be parted. The present day and a 15 year old boy arrives with his parents at the house now a renovated holiday let for a much needed break but for the boy his love of history and rampant imagination leads him into a bewildering and painful journey to re-unite the lovers from the past. The 18th and 21st centuries intermittently collide in this intriguing ghostly story of enduring love and adolescent angst and where one idiosyncratic man only knows what is actually real.
