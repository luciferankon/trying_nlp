Lilith is a about a mysterious young woman in an elite sanitarium in Maryland who seems to weave a magical spell all around her. A restless but sincere young man with an equally obscure past is seemingly drawn into her web. As time passes their relationship deepens and intensifies and the differences between them begin to blur leading to a shocking but oddly logical conclusion. Ex-soldier Vincent returns home and takes a job at the nearby insane asylum. He enjoys the work and the in-mates like his open friendliness. A particular relationship develops with the beautiful and intelligent Lilith one that the doctors encourage as it starts to bring Lilith out of her shell. Attractive but withdrawn she has proved something of an enigma for them and they have perhaps not understood that her past and present use and misuse of this same attractiveness could be the key to her problems. They may also be failing to recognise that as Vincent comes under her spell his own behaviour could become dangerously obsessive.
