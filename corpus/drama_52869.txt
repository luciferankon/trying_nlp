Socrates attends an awards after-party for his friend Agathon Good who won for best drama. As everyone claims their love for him and his work Good insists that each give as clever a speech he can about the character and practice of love. The result is the most famous conversation ever held. Envisioned as a meeting of witty hip thinkers of any era the script uses updated language but is faithful line by line to Plato's version.
