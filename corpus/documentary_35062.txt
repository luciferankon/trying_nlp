In this unique tale of cooperation we visit the eider ducks and farmers of Iceland and witness a centuries old practise which has woven its way into the fabric of Icelandic culture. For centuries the people of Iceland have been protecting the wild eider ducks and their nests and in return have collected their valuable down at the end of the nesting season. This one-hour documentary explores the unique relationship which exists between man and duck.
