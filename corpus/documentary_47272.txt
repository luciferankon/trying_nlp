"The Hollywood Librarian: A Look at Librarians Through Film" is the first comprehensive treatment of the subject of librarians. A vivid blend of factual documentary feature film and storytelling it reveals the history and realities of librarianship in the entertaining and appealing context of American movies. Interviews with actual librarians intercut with film clips of cinematic librarians examine such issues as literature books and reading censorship library funding citizenship and democracy. For the first time we see and understand the real lives and real work of American librarians who for decades have been a cultural force hiding in plain sight. This film's subject is librarians: who they are what they do why they do it and the impact of their work in people's lives. The underlying meaning is how we express our own humanity how we listen to ourselves and one another in the realm of the written and read word -- a uniquely human privilege.
