Bodies in constant motion and gleaming with sweat - a film that makes a highly cinematic art. In their panorama of Cuban boxing Stefano Knuchel and Ivan Nurchis meet masseurs trainers and idols of both the past and the future. They talk about hopes and dreams as well as their failures. But not just in boxing: the documentary is a great metaphor for the cuban dreams of revolution and how they ended up.
