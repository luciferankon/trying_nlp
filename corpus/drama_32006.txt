Based on the real-life chronicle of the "nine for nine" Pennsylvania coal miners who were rescued in the summer of 2002. Told from their own perspective the movie reveals their extraordinary experience and takes viewers inside the mine (shot in real mines and recreated on a soundstage) to show the life-threatening dangers and physical limitations the men faced for 77 hours as they waited for rescue. The movie was shot in many of the actual locations in Somerset County Pennsylvania including scenes at the real-life Quecreek mine.
