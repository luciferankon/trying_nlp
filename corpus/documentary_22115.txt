It's one of nature's most destructive forces and it has central Alberta under attack. In most years hailstorms cause more damage in minutes than any other form of sever weather in Canada - more than tornadoes hurricanes blizzards even floods. Central Alberta gets more hail than any other place in the world due to the combination of Rocky Mountains hot summer days and high altitude that creates a powerful hail-making machine. This is the story of the daring pilots who fly directly into storms attempting to reduce the damage through a controversial cloud seeding program. Does it work? Should we do more of it? Are there environmental risks?
