Jos wakes up in a homeless shelter in Groningen (North of the Netherlands). It's a place to stay for the night. At 10am the street life starts over again. Come rain or shine. It doesn't matter if you're ill or don't feel like leaving. At 10pm people are welcome again. For Jos this is a day like many other or isn't it? No today is different. Jos has a plan. He wants to make amends. Can he convince his ex girlfriend? And his friends? That it's all going to be different now? Jos wants to change. No more drinking. No coke heroin or other junk. Never again. It's now or never. Well maybe this week? Jos really wants to change. Starting today well......at least tomorrow.
