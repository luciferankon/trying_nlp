Food Beware begins with a visit to a small village in France where the town's mayor has decided to make the school lunch menu organic and locally grown. It then talks to a wide variety of people with differing perspectives to find common ground - children parents teachers health care workers farmers elected officials scientists researchers and the victims of illnesses themselves. Revealed in these moving and often surprising conversations are the abuses of the food industry the competing interests of agribusiness and public health the challenges and rewards of safe food production and the practical sustainable solutions that we can all take part in. Food Beware is food for thought - and a blueprint for a growing revolution.
