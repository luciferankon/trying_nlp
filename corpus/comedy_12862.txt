Company owner Seibold has an affair with the younger Rita. When his wife starts having suspects due to a purse lost in a taxi he comes up with the excuse she'd be his companion Max' girlfriend. This leads to the idea to generally "enhance" Max' past to make him more interesting to Seibold's bold daughter.
