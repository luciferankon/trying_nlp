After being banished to a 1000 year sleep for his crimes against the vampire race vampire Vlad Dracuola the most feared vampire slayer of all time is awakened in a tiny college town to hunt down the youngest vampire to break the vampire council's sacred rules- turning humans into vampires without the council's permission. Vlad's greatest adventure? Waking up in time for lecture turning in his homework on time and trying not to eat his classmates...all while hunting down the 'bad guy.' Oh yeah...Vlad's got a great granddaughter to deal with too. This campus SUCKS.
