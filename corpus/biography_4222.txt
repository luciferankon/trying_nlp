This is the true story of Bishop Edward Sargent who was born on 1815 at England and was brought to India by his mother when he was a child. As he had lost his father at a very young age and his mother was unable to raise him on her own she gave him to a Military Orphans Asylum where he was raised. At the age of 17 he decided to become a missionary and at the age of 19 he came to share the gospel to the people of Palayamkottai Tamil Nadu and continued to do so until he went to be with the Lord in 1889 at the age of 74.
