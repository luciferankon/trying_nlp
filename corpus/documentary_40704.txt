In this program we provide an analysis of the phenomenon of water in Mexico. Water is looked at as an affected natural resource as well as an essential element for the country's development. Specialists on the subject tell us of the alterations that have taken place in the country's underground water deposits the influence of climate change on hydro-logical resources plants for producing potable water and different uses that can be made of water. They also inform us about institutions that are in charge of water's regulation and administration. This program hopes to be a reminder of the responsibilities that we all have as well as that water is not infinite and in Mexico as in the rest of the world this element has become a problem that is impossible to ignore.
