Very well-endowed swimmer Peter Evans wins the gold for USA. A former gold-medal swimmer-turned-reporter interviews Peter but can hardly wait to reconnect with past glory by getting it on with him in the locker room. Not satisfied Peter heads out to the parking lot to whack off in an unlocked car. When mother and son owners thinking he's a thief at work come upon him the mom scurries off to fetch a cop while the son discovering the truth joins Peter servicing the swimmer before sodomizing him. Peter next visits his coach's hotel room after nearly getting mugged for his Team USA jacket. As Peter rests in the bedroom another athlete comes calling putting a new spin on the term "top coach" by bottoming for him (which seems a regular occurrence between these two). Their moans awaken Peter who watching from the doorway is turned on by the activity but not interested in them so he decides to crank one out to his own reflection in a mirror. Now he's ready to celebrate his victory with his teammates with champagne and an orgy.
