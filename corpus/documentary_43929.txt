The greenhouses of Almeria can already be watered through Internet. Underneath its plastic covers six times bigger than the surface of Manhattan the new design vegetables that the European markets require are born. The Almeria miracle has needed just two decades to turn into rich men the farmers of the area. Farming enterprises of the province bill conjointly 10 million euros a day. The miracle goes on regardless of the consequences its machines destroy hills bury ravines and the plastic surfaces have already reached the heart of the Natural Park of Cabo de Gata. The 'pateras' thousands of South Americans Lithuanians and Russians answer the call of this insatiable miracle. Prostitution and immigration mafias are thriving in this old part of the West that people call 'Paradise'.
