100 years after the defeat of the local troops under Gen. Miguel Malvar in the Philippine-American War the people of a Batangue≈Ño town would have lost its character typified by the Tagalog term "barako" meaning brave or courageous.

But they are slowly swayed to a new liberal direction by a small coffee club called "barakuhan" whose organizers see in it a reawakening of their native courage.
