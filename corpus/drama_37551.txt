The love or at least the lust has gone out of the marriage between college professor Heather (Marie Leroux) and Kyle (Martin Hewitt) since he gave up his career as a respected art critic to try his hand at performance art. In her eyes he's lost his ambition and she just doesn't respect him anymore. When she leaves hoping to force him to think things over he calls a hooker beguiling Stacey (Amy Rochelle) who uses all the feminine wiles and lingerie she can muster to make him her slave. Meanwhile poor young blonde busty and beautiful Irene (Sara Suzanne Brown) arrives to look over Kyle's house which he has put up for sale to underwrite his art career. She comes back for an affair because her plumbing-obsessed husband Bill (Mark T. Paladini) doesn't provide the romance and sensuality she needs as a woman. Kyle falls in love with Stacey who doesn't love him while Irene falls in love with Kyle who doesn't love her. A married performance artist begins an obsessive relationship with a call girl. The film uses the annoying technique of having the characters stop and discuss their situation with the audience as if they were a psychiatrist.
