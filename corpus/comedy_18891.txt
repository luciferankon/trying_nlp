Ex-marriage swindler Ewald Honig arrives in East Berlin from West Germany in order to spend a quiet evening of his life with his daughter Ina. He is already in his mid-fifties. Ina an apple fallen not far from the tree is still trying to rehabilitate her cash flow with the help of a few gullible gray-haired men. While he seeks to dissuade her from doing so by cementing her marriage to her next "victim" several women of advanced age make it difficult for Ewald to resist their own seductions. Searching for Ewald however is the Hungarian criminal investigator Johanna Farkas while the criminal psychologist Dr. Achim Engelhardt is tracking down Ina; both use their own peculiar methods. And since they both do not know each other Achim mistakes Johanna for his suspect. So this mixed-up love story comes to a happy end.
