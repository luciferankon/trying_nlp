Five friends take a weekend vacation to celebrate a birthday. Their car breaks down in the middle of nowhere and it takes them 2 days to walk to the nearest town. The only problem now is the town only occupies one person: Ms. Sally who isn't much help. They begin to lose their minds and start hallucinating one after the other. With no food water or hope they quickly begin to tear each other apart. Who if any will make it out alive?
