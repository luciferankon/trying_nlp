Acclaimed documentarist Mira Hamermesh recorded her personal voyage around Poland to rediscover her past and on the way examines how present-day Poles remember the Jews and how they are affected by the artifacts they have left behind. Hamermesh did not come easily to the film's subject. For years she avoided confronting her early years in the Lodz ghetto and made award-winning documentaries about almost every hard-hitting case of oppression except the Holocaust: apartheid the Arab-Israeli conflict and India were all subjects which came under her scrutiny. Finally her commissioning editor said to her "isn't it time to go home?" and Hamermesh realized it was time to stop skirting around the issue.
