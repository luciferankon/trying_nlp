In August 2006 in the midst of the war between the Shiite party Hezbollah and the Israeli army in Lebanon a controversial article was published in the Lebanese newspaper Al Nahar "To Be a Shiite Today" written by a Shiite psychology professor Dr. Mona Fayyad a harsh criticism of the Hezbollah party and its sympathizers. This article provoked and original and lively discourse within the Shia and the Arab intellectuals about the Shiite identity. It motivated Palestinian filmmaker Nizar Hassan to make a personal film in Lebanon a journey of discovery and understanding of the Shiite state of affairs trying to define and/or redefine the Shiite current reality identity and role.
