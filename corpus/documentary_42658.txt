Ralphie May was the first entertainer the President asked to travel into Iraq to perform for the US and Allied Troops. During his trip he was given access to everything he requested. Its a gripping story told up close and real. The news was pretty explicit however this film provides some of the extreme close ups that have made permanent impressions on all the troops who served there.
