The Brown vs. Board of Education case declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. But in the time since how have black children benefited? This documentary makes the case that the education system within the United States is not only generally flawed but particularly under serves black communities and black children. Within this film the creators sat down with black academics to get their perspective on the current public school system and what alternative options that parents have to give children their best chance. Additionally the film gives insight into two homes of children who are being home-schooled. There we find out the benefits of finding ways to home-school and/or supplement your child's learning to include a full and true history of the United States and the world that is not white-washed. Additionally children learn at their own pace with their strengths highlighted leaving many of them testing ahead of the grades they would be in had they stayed in public school. The documentary makes the case that in order for the black community to succeed proper education needs to be instilled and the system itself has to be rebuilt.
