This video starts the Saturday before the 2013 Preston Table Tennis Championships and ends 6 days later with volunteers moving 8 of our tables to UCLAN for the Cadet and Junior 6 Nations tournament. It is my blog of what it's like to play in Preston Table Tennis Championships. The highs and the lows. Throughout the day you'll see how the event is organised meet the volunteers who run the event the players their aspirations for the day and their reasons for playing table tennis. It will introduce a human element to a sport often portrayed in a cold light. By the end of the film you will understand why we do what we do and you'll have met some great characters in our league. Hopefully it will even inspire you to pick up a table tennis bat yourself and experience the wonderful game that is table tennis.
