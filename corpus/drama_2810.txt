An adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel of the same. In 1982 Colin Gregg David Nicholas Wilkinson Hugh Stoddart and Corin Campbell Hill made a TV movie of the book starring Rosemary Harris Michael Gough and Kenneth Branagh. It was well received by the press in both the UK and USA and it won many awards including a BAFTA nomination. With the book still in copyright in the USA the team have come together to look at the novel through older eyes and to try and improve on the first film.
