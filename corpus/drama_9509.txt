Single mother Nora lives with her daughter Sarah on a cardboard groundsheet and hammock tied to the undercarriage of a semitrailer in the parking lot of a Manila cargo terminal. Deep in debt and receiving little help from her husband Nora has nothing to live for except for Sarah. Living in a community suffering from abject poverty Nora sifts through trash and spends time with Vilma a happily single shopkeeper and Minda whose truck-driver husband disappeared a month ago presumably to live with another woman. With no other viable options to support her daughter Nora turns to prostitution.
