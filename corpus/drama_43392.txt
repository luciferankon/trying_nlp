Episodes from an Investigation is an essay/narrative film presented as a series of fragments from the lives of numerous cinephiles and radicals living in 21st Century America. The film cuts between three related narratives: a film collective on a journey to find a mysterious film theorist/filmmaker; a couple whose relationship is falling apart as they each work on pieces concerning the cinematic past and the cinematic present; and two cinematic radicals holed up in an unknown location trying to understand how to revolutionize cinema.
