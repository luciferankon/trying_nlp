They find each other sail away to Gardner's Island (in Long Island Sound) and live happily ever after. The live action short was to be a promotional short subject for the upcoming feature film "The Owl and the Pussycat" with Barbra Streisand and George Segal. The score from the feature film by the Bloos Sweat and Tears was used in the short and footage was shot and editing conformed to the music. The short was not completed in time to promote the feature. However it was released by Columbia Pictures ans played with other Columbia features including "Five Easy Peaces" with Jack Nicholson a Bob Rafelson picture.
