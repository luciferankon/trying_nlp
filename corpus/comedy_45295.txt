When a happy-go-lucky pizza deliveryman loses his job he thinks there is nope until a strange man arrives to tell him that he has been left his great uncle's old rundown funeral home. If he can make it profitable in 90 days he stands to inherit a fortune. If not he can keep the funeral home's old hearse to deliver pizzas in.
