That's What It's All About is all about the journey of Bollywood Blockbuster 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo'. Our unit shadowed Team PRDP for over 2 years in pursuit of capturing all the minute little points that went behind making this huge saga. We got an all access pass to their every department right from the scripting stage to its release. We got to witness all the hurdles that came along the way and how they were bested. Every day brought with it a new nut to crack but the entire unit of over 400 people would look up to Captain of the Ship Sooraj R. Barjatya who led by exemplary example!
