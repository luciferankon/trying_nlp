America has questions about today's youth what we care about and where we're headed. We had those questions too. So after graduating college four of us loaded an RV and embarked on a journey looking for answers. We traveled to all of the lower 48 states talking to our peers about growing up 9/11 race the Internet careers sex love and the American Dream. Along the way we met a wide cross-section of young Americans ranging from a cancer researcher in Boston to a drug dealer in New Mexico from an Iraq veteran in Florida to the founder of Facebook in Silicon Valley. The film ultimately leads to the recent historic election where our generation finally stands up to make its voice heard. OUR TIME is a passionate portrayal of a generation a meditation on coming of age in 21st-century America and a rallying cry against apathy.
