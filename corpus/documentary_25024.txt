'Go the Distance' is a documentary chronicling the journey of 16 bicyclists (Team Will) who rode across America in 10 days to raise funds and awareness for childhood cancer research. The story focuses on the ride from San Francisco to Washington D.C. to help successfully lobby in front of Congress for the passage of the 'Carolyn Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act.' It also shares touching stories of some of the 'Heroes' (children with cancer) the cyclists rode for. Featuring interviews with doctors parents with children fighting cancer politicians as well as the cyclists themselves this documentary is geared towards the general public and conveys a clear message that 'it's not okay to just sit back and let things happen when you can make a difference.'
