Imposing austere gray buildings dominate a skyline; all is silent except for the wind. The only signs of life or movement anywhere are flocks of geese flying in V formation across the sky. A statue of a winged man high on one of the buildings stirs pulling away from his stone mount. Strains of Van Den Budenmayer's "Concerto en SÃ­" fill the air. The statue moves his wings and flies from the building seemingly determined to join the geese. But the structure itself has other ideas: will freedom take flight or will it be crushed?
