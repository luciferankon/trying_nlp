For Jason V 60 hours of live programming hosted by renowned oceanographer Bob Ballard were beamed from a jungle control room using feeds from the four primary locations in Belize to science centers and museums throughout North America and Great Britain. This unprecedented experiment in "telepresence" allowed approximately one million school-age children and their teachers to interact with scientists at work in breathtaking locations. By giving students the opportunity to operate remote cameras in the rainforest canopy and ask scientists questions as they conducted their field work the project made the study of ecology biodiversity and environmental science vividly real.
