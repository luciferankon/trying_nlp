Based on the acclaimed play that the Independent of London hailed as "a bracingly uncensored exploration of the tensions and treacheries in a beleaguered male subculture" PONIES is about three men in a treacherous subset of society and uses the gambling parlor as a backdrop for a provocative modern morality tale. Ultimately these men-immigrants Americans human beings-are forced to protect from one another their most valuable commodity: the right to stay on American soil.
