Inspired by Kafka's Trial. Rick Dawson lives a comfort life with two women receives an indictment in the mail ordering him to appear before an arraignment court. This summons forces him intro a relationship with a lawyer of questionable intent for the duration of the trial. Throughout the film we get glimpses of street life starting with a friend trying to bribe him to do a grass deal using a found ring as amigo bait. Later Rick loses his finger while being mugged for the ring which is just another situation showing that karma is constantly reigning down havoc. The environments are always hostile fights seem to occur for no reason peripheral death happens and the unending Kafkaesque headaches of the indictment continually mount up never resolving so that even the actual trial appears anticlimactic as a vindictive Judge presides over Rick's Human Rights. Existential guilt is the root of the film. Occasionally lurking in the background is a kabalist-like observer observing this constant chain of bizarre circumstances.
