This art experiment by Andy Warhol captures the simple act of a man eating mushrooms. This one-man show starring Robert Indiana presents the actor slowly eating some mushrooms having an enjoyable time not only with the food but also with a friendly cat that from time to time comes to see what the man is doing.
