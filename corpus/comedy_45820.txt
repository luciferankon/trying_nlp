This farce-like movie takes place in a tiny dress factory in Norway. The company "Fredrikssons Fashion" is owned and run by a swede. His employees are a bunch of ladies that think of their job as an opportunity for social get-to-gether that they are even getting paid for! The poor foreman is too naive and dumb so the girls wrap him around their fingers all the time.
