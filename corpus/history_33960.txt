A parody of American film directors throughout the 20th century and a meditation on cinema history. Each of the 12 stories shares a similar cast and basic premise: "A man walks into a bar..." Yet every episode is completely unique in its interpretation of the director's style technique content and genre. From film noir to musical comedy Charlie Chaplin to Steven Spielberg "A Man Walks Into A Bar" offers a crash course in cinema history in 12 episodes.
