Because of his hot often-flaring temper Jimmy Kelly loses another job much to the disappointment of his mother and the disgust of his fianc√©e Margie. Margie is a secretary for lawyer L. Herbert Oakley who advises Jimmy to study law but that doesn't last long. His friend Sammy Cohen gets him a job with him as a process server. He serves a summons on a night club dancer Carmencita who says she owes a bill because she had a fight with her sweetheart - one L. Herbert Oakley. The district attorney delegates Jimmy and Sammy to serve subpoenas on a "Trixie Belle" who turns out to be a formidable gangster plus one on a mysterious "Mr.7". Trixie holds Jimmy a prisoner in an apartment but gets drunk and reveals that Oakley is Mr. 7 the leader of an oil-swindle operation. Sammy helps Jimmy escape and they learn that Oakley is about to leave for Montreal and is taking Margiue with him. Jimmy rescues Margie and serves the summons on Oakley. Just before he and Margie are to be married the next day Jimmy receives a notice from the draft board demanding his appearance that afternoon. As he departs his mother assures Margie that since Jimmy never held a job more than two months the war will soon be over.
