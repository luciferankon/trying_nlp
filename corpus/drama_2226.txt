A jobless machinist Billy tired of begging for jobs and dumpster-diving makes a sign for help using ketchup from a fast-food joint. Everyone ignores him except Kurt a slick fast-talking completely untrustworthy guy who seems like all the used-car salesmen in Ohio put together. He offers Billy a cheeseburger for washing his car. No problem. That accomplished Kurt ups the stakes by offering Billy an option to do another errand for a steak dinner. The tasks seem innocuous but Billy begins to show up on many security cameras and Kurt's requests get stranger and stranger the stakes higher and higher until there's a final irrevocable task. Cleveland landmarks look refreshing in this feature film and the camera picks up other corners of the city you may have never seen.
