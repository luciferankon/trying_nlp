Cattle Country is a modern-day western reality series. It is situated in the Nebraska Sandhills where all 800 of the county's population is directly affected by the cattle industry. The stories follow three interdependent real-life families who ranch farm and run a feed lot respectively: the Caulfield's who raise cattle on grass the Heerten's who grow field corn to fatten the cattle and the Ferguson's who own a feed lot where the cattle are fattened. The series is four faceted. From one view it is simply an action-adventure show where the viewer can vicariously be a cowboy and play with big boy toys each week. From another view it is a heart-warming family value's show providing positive role models of spouses parents and children working and playing outdoors. Twist the view again and it educates about the inner nuts-and-bolts workings of a diminishing agricultural society. And finally the series tackles controversial legislative policies or politically correct views which have unintended negative consequences on Americans' food production. Cattle Country is comprised from the 2% of America's population which has been endowed stewardship of America's eco-system and demonstrates the reverence with which they hold it. Cattle Country is America's grass roots.
