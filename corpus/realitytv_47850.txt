Vasilisa and Luke are two young creatives living in London. While not a couple they share not only a room but a bed (!) to make ends meet. Meanwhile cranes are everywhere to be seen as luxury towers are going up everywhere. Not only will the overwhelming majority of new dwellings be unaffordable for Vasilisa Luke and the vast majority of Londoners - but many will be unoccupied as well as they are trophy/investment purchases for the foreign rich. Vasilisa and Luke are fortunate in that they are great friends and have each other. But as they make clear this is about "survival" and their living circumstance is representative of the backward way a major developed country treats housing. Meanwhile on another front the recently-formed 'Skyline Campaign' struggles to preserve the iconic London vista from the gaudy grotesque and overly-prolific new constructions.
