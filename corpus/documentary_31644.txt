The film has an element of music-tour documentary but it is equally mixed with travelogue and ethnographic study. It is without the frenetic pace of the Dylan films or the intense purposefulness of the Chicago films but instead it offers an outsider's curious gaze with an attempt to bridge cultural and geographic gulfs. Sally Grossman's voice-over translations of song lyrics and poetry lend the film a tranquility unlike anything else in Alk's work.
