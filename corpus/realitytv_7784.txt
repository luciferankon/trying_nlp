The format for Big Brother in Canada remains largely unchanged from the U.S. edition making them the only two version of the series thus far to follow this format. HouseGuests are sequestered in the Big Brother House without contact with the outside world. Each week the HouseGuests take part in several compulsory challenges that determine who will win food luxuries and opportunities to become the Head of Household (HoH) or win the Power of Veto (PoV). The winner of the weekly HoH competition is immune from nominations and nominates two fellow HouseGuests for eviction. The two HouseGuests nominated for eviction are also referred to as being "on the block" for eviction. After a HouseGuest becomes HoH he or she is ineligible to take part in the next HoH competition. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction and take them off the block. If the PoV winner exercises the power the HoH then nominates another HouseGuest to go up on the block for eviction. HouseGuests also take part in the Have vs. Have-Not competitions. Depending on their performance during the competitions HouseGuests are divided into either the "Haves" or the "Have Nots." The Have Nots are restricted to eating "Big Brother Slop" and a couple of food items selected by the viewing public. They are also allowed to eat condiments and protein shakes. Have Nots are only allowed to take cold showers and typically sleep on uncomfortable beds in a room with poor aesthetics. On Eviction Night all HouseGuests except for the HoH and the two nominees on the block vote to evict one of the two nominees. This compulsory vote takes place in the Diary Room where voting HouseGuests are asked by the show's host Arisa Cox whom they want to evict. In the event of a tie the HoH casts the deciding vote announcing it in front of the other HouseGuests
