Two randomly selected contestants are flown into a foreign city. Armed with only a few supplies they must complete a series of puzzling challenges and effectively travel around the city's landmarks and sites. Time is ticking away as the couple has a time limit to beat. If successful they win an all-expenses paid luxury stay in that city to explore it even more. If they fail they must take the next flight home.
