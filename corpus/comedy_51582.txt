Shavian social satire. Odette is an actress who's now the mistress of a government minister. Her household of cook maid and chauffeur needs a valet. On the eve of going with the minister to Deauville she engages Désiré a robust and talkative man even through his most recent employer a countess intimates improprieties. Things go well for a short time: the wealthy talk about the servants the servants talk about their employers. Then Désiré has explicit dreams about Odette; his outbursts wake the maid in the next room nightly. Odette has the same dream each night awaking the minister and his jealousy. Is there any decorous way to handle these subconscious attractions?
