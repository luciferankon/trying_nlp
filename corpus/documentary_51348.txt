God is my co-pilot is a film about the navy pilots who carried out most of the air strikes on Kosovo and Serbia during the Kosovo conflict in 1999. The film was shot entirely aboard the USS Roosevelt the largest aircraft carrier of the American navy with 5.000 people aboard including 200 pilots. The film is the story of an air strike from the point of view of the pilots. We see the briefings the preparation the religious services that precede every flight. The pilots speak openly about their fears their pride the kick they they experience during a mission and the moral dilemmas they face during their work. The film shows the important role of religion in these circumstances. Pilots pray for safety and for good judgment. The chaplain plays an important role as he convinces them that they are fulfilling 'God's plan' and he repeats that they are in fact 'God's strong arm'. The film questions this statement and remembers the viewers of one of the Ten Commandments √ùou shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God. The documentary God is my co-pilot is the first film in a project of 10 documentaries about the Ten Commandments.
