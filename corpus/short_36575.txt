An introduction to the nature of the propaganda films and the new characters. Mockingjay is about battles fought both on the battlefield and in the media and how those lines cross each over between image and physical fighting. Castor and Pollux back-story is highlighted including how Castor saved money to get his brother out from working in the underground tunnels in the Capitol - can we say hint to Part 2! Cressida is like a war journalist willing to go out there and get what she needs. She's elegant and tough attitude. She pushes Katniss where others would back off. She's not afraid to push people who are in a fragile state.
