The year is 1970 and while the outside world is drastically changing in a Baltimore psychiatric institution a young Greenlandic woman has come forward with allegations of abuse. But not only is she crazy; she's also half Inuit. And nobody believes a "crazy Indian". Even when Anne's bruises are plainly visible to the entire ward the nurses look the other way. "She did it to herself" they say. But fellow patient Bridgette Leven knows better... 138 Arlington recounts the story of two courageous women who begin as victims and who through their determination and audacity become survivors.
