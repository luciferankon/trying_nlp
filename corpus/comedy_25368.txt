The world is obsessed with celebrity culture. Who's hooking up who's hanging it up and most importantly what were they wearing when they did it. Websites like TMZ Perez Hilton Hollywood Life and Gawker have some of the most loyal and rabid fans online while television networks like E! and Bravo not only feed our need for celebrity information but create celebrities of their own with shows like Keeping Up With the Kardashians and The Real Housewives. In short we love celebrities... almost as much as we love to hate them. Out of that idea came TMI. Every Sunday night TMI presents an all-new hour of sketch comedy commentary and musical theater based on the stories of the week in entertainment celebrity and pop culture. Each week a celebrity guest joins our cast to "host" the show and take part in the fun. Nothing is off limits. Nothing is too silly or trivial. Nothing is too controversial. Every time Beiber opens his mouth Miley opens Instagram or Kim Kardashian opens her... well you know TMI is there with its own unique and hilarious take on the story.
