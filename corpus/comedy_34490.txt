Türlich accidentally stumbles across some information about his origin and decides to go to Klein Ischgl in Austria.

While Türlich rediscovers his roots (and his affection for Heidi) Josch finds out that evil entrepreneur Tronald Dump plans to blow the mountain to smithereens in order to erect a plastic mountain with a ski resort where you never can get hurt. Josch now has to convince Türlich about the evil intentions of Dump fast only has there just been quite a fight between the two lifelong friends.
