Marshall is a young high school kid who breaks the fourth wall and tell us about his life just like if he was sitting with us in our living room. Mostly the show revolves around him in love with the most beautiful girl in school who he has known since childhood but who is dating the school bully.(who of course makes Marshall life miserable)
