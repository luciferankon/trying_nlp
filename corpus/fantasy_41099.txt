An old Egyptian silent movie restored with great care and dubbed by a couple of lip-reading deaf mutes relates the story of a young girl wandering in the desert hoping upon an heroic life until she resurrects a dead man with a sneeze. This miracle attracts the attention of a lot of people especially from a greedy businessman and from a scientist both trying to get as much as possible from her.
