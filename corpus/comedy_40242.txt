A Mexican boy bound for Chicago tries to cross the border but is the crowded wagon he rides in going the right way? An offbeat allegorical odyssey that blends absurd humor with pastoral imagery. A young man and a dead man journey north through a subtly surreal desert landscape picking up a wagonful of odd characters as they go in this darkly humorous satire of contemporary Mexico. Chencho is a boy who wants to cross the border to get to Chicago to be with his older brother. On the way he meets an old man who offers him a ride in his wagon. But the man dies. Chencho continues on his journey with the dead man sitting by his side. On the road an array of characters who have nowhere to go and no reason to stay appear on the scene. One after another they jump into the wagon heading north guided by the hand of the dead man who by the way is now starting to rot.
