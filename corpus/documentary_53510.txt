Jürgen is cloakroom attendant at the beach and artist. An artist who never visited any academy. His mother Edeltraud recounts a journey that started a long time ago and has etched itself into the story of her life. And Günter the father is the silent background companion. Slowly the film feels its way through the lives of three people in the small town of Glücksburg. Father Mother Son. But was that really all? Layer by layer the film explores the delicate ramifications of their life paths. Against the backdrop of a small resort at the Baltic Sea the portrait of a family emerges who was once brought together by coincidence. But it was only due to their uncompromising decisions that these coincidences were transformed into an inseparable bond. Their stories are stories of families dreams traumas set-backs and determination and allow us an ever-changing glimpse of the lives of these three people. Just when the image is gaining clarity it immediately appears blurry and new.
