PARKED LIVES is an intimate portrait of Vali one of the estimated two million Eastern European truck drivers who travel back and forth across Southern and Western Europe. Vali is a Romanian in his thirties. Navigating endless motorways and anonymous parking lots he endures the break-up of his marriage. His child remains a stranger to him. An unexpected friendship with a parrot inspires Vali to try and turn his life around. In the United States "trucker films" have been a genre in their own right for decades featuring a lone wolf traveling through breathtaking landscapes. It's high time we made a movie like that in Europe. PARKED LIVES is a highly topical documentary that reveals a little known world of enslavement and exploitation.
