South African women whose lives are very different and yet are linked together by the force of synchronicity. It's about the strong connections that people share whether they are aware of them or not. If South Africa's past has been characterised by separation it seems fitting that ten years into our democracy we focus on the connections within our diverse multicultural society. This is the central theme of Home Affairs. The focus of the series is women's stories - stories which reflect the diversity of the millions of women found within our country. We focus on nine specific women who undertake journeys of self-discovery and reflection over the 13 episodes.
