An 11-year-old street boy Obdulio who sells newspapers for a living but cannot read or write finds a magical "Maestro" in the night watchman of the newspaper's office. Obdulio's charismatic mentor not only introduces him to the world of literacy but also teaches him the real meaning of life through the lyrics of the "Murgas" (Carnival Pierrots) during the mythical nights of the irreverent and provocative Urugauyan Carnival.
