Handsome healthy happily horny Hamburg youngster Henning is a serial seducer in Munich who always pleases in bed yet usually gets the short end of the stick from ingrate girls. Tired of 'begging' for board and doing dangerous 'odd jobs' even as unsuspecting drug courier Henning has a brilliant idea: he gets the press to advertise him as 'boyfriend for a day' so lonely ladies pay to spoil him. But the vultures want their golden goose back or steal his earnings.
