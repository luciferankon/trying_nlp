Two pre-med college students have their backs to the wall when they get busted for selling designer drugs. Now they must help a bitter cop sting their clients who include a well versed redneck cock fighter a Mexican drug lord who owns a lawn care business and an "escort" with a heart of gold. Their rapacity for money and flesh draws them all to their inexorable ends at the Desert Oasis Motor Lodge in this white-trash black comedy about a drug sting gone horribly wrong.
