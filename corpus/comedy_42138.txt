In this hard to imitate format former sports reporter Mark Uytterhoeven arguably Flanders' greatest comical TV talent and a varying panel of celebrities make fun in many different ways by comments parodies doctored texts and images etc. of recent programs on Flemish national TV (both VRTs own and its commercial rivals) hence the title meaning "All can (be done) better". Nobody is spared: actors presenters reporters politicians script camera-work editing even publicity; besides actual faults they can be made the butt of a joke that sprouts from the panel's vicious imagination e.g. quoting out of context or re-editing.
