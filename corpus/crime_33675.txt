The film will be cast as a crime procedural. A obsessed detective is tracking a serial killer of prostitutes. So obsessed is he that he cannot bear not having a suspect in his custody at any given time. Forced to release one suspect he pounces on another and another in his investigation. If it weren't so serious his mania would be comic. The real murderer a dentist never appears on the detective's list of suspects. He is on a manic quest of his own. To find the perfect victim to possess the one perfect woman who will put an end to the pain of his obscure desire. True to his profession the dentist's aim is to repair the bone and end the pain of the flesh. Although their lives are socially separate these two questing men are nevertheless destined to meet face-to-face. The wife of the detective is a policewoman who works undercover for him as a prostitute. This frustrated lady is on her own quest: a soul mate a man who can read her thoughts and feelings. When she is picked up by the dentist as a potential victim she finds her ideal. And the dentist finds his perfect woman. Following the Latin Christian liturgy 'O Salutaris Hostia O Saving Victim' we assert that only the victim can save the murderer. That is in our story if she doesn't arrest him and if he doesn't murder her. Behind the contemporary story however there lurks a parallel story from the past. Our dentist killer is an incarnation of a doctor-dentist who chloroformed his victims at a time when chloroform went undetected. He was never caught and the case was unsolved... That was then this is now.
