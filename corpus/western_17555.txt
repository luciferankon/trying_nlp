While robbing the stage with Jeff Johnson ('Tommy Farrell' (qv)) outlaws Jordan ('Terry Frost (I)' (qv)) and Wilkins ('Zon Murray' (qv)) kill the stage guard and leave Jeff unconscious on the trail to be picked up by pursuing U.S. Marshals Tom Yeager ('Whip Wilson' (qv)) and "Hungry" Rogers ('Andy Clyde'0. Posing as an outlaw Tom is put in the same cell with Jeff and with Hungry's help stages a jailbreak and takes Jeff with him on the latter's promise to lead him to an outlaw gang head by the supposedly-dead Bill Moore ('Stanley Price (I)' (qv)). They find the gang led by Anne Moore ('Phyllis Coates' (qv)) who passes on the instructions of her infamous father. Wilkins after an unsuccessful attempt to ambush Tom is taken to jail where the gabby sheriff informs him of the two marshal's true identities. Tom and Anne take the loot from a staged-bank robbery to Moore where Tom arrests him and Anne and declares that Moore is an impostor. Meanwhile Jordan visits Wilkins in jail and learns about Tom being a lawman and sets a trap for him.
