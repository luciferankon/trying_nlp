In July 1967 Detroit experienced one of America's most violent civil disturbances. To tell that story in an emblematic way this film fuses rare archival footage from the era - including newsreel educational films and more than 400 reels of home movies donated by Detroiters - along with illustrations. The narrative combines contemporary interviews oral histories radio broadcasts and dispatch recordings to create an immersive film experience that transports the audience back in time to explore the causes and aftermath of Detroit's most pivotal moment in history.
