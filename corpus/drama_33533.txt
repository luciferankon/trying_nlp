Pictures of Albert Einstein before 1905 show a young man who is arrogant and narrow minded photos of him afterwards are quite different. History shows that something very revolutionary happened to Albert during that year while working as a third class Swiss patent clerk. Little known history is that Albert's first wife Mileva a brilliant physicist/mathematician was a major collaborator in the four revolutionary theories that bear the Einstein name for that year. Even less known is that Albert and Mileva had severe mental health issues individually and collectively and that the young Albert was not the expansive thinker and global humanitarian that he became in later years. This film shows how a 'common' Janitor educates Albert scientifically spiritually and emotionally and councils Mileva as well keeping the dynamic duo together for one more year thus enabling the world to benefit from their synergistic wisdom and brilliance. Young Albert Einstein and wife Mileva are on the verge of making revolutionary scientific discoveries there are severe emotional problems between them which are repaired by a 'common' janitor who intervenes to keep them together for just one more critical year (1905).
