Short experimental video based on a poem by Rainer Maria Rilke - The Panther. My fascination for Rainer Maria Rilke's so called object-poems is grounded in his approach to describe the pure nature of an object. Rilke does not only describe but creates by the means of literature atmosphere and rhythm whereby he manages to come in touch with the core. The essence lays in repetition and restlessness. Only for a very short moment there seems to be some hope. A short vision barely noticeable quickly dissolved. What remains is 'a dance of force about a center in which a greater will stands paralyzed'
