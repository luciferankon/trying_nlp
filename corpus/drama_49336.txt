During the Georgian-Ossetian conflict in 2008 after bombing two men - Georgian soldier Zaza and terminally ill old Ossetian man Zaur become trapped in an underground room of a 5-store building. They immediately begin to blame each other for incitement a war argue who is guilty and who is right. But as time passes the two gradually realize that both sides have their truth and the whole conflict is inspired by the "third force". From their further conversation behavior how they treat one another it becomes obvious that both are sons of the high Caucasian mountains with similar traditions beliefs unwritten Caucasian laws and heritage and both nations have nothing to conflict on. As it comes to light later the old man is inhabitant of the house and knows the spare exit from the basement. Ossetian asks Georgian to hand the letter he's going to write before his death to his (Ossetian's) son after the war is over. Than the old man shows the Georgian the second exit.
