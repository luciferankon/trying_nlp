'Kibera: the biggest slum in Nairobi and probably throughout sub-Saharan Africa. I came here for the first time ten years ago. Kibera is a never-ending stretch of huts: there are no infrastructures no water no sewers. Poverty disrupted families extreme violence almost no access to medical care and education: this is the social context in which the phenomenon of street children is born and buttressed. Ten years ago I came to document the start of a very unusual project that aimed to help a group of street children in Nairobi. The project was called Ndugu Mdogo which in Swahili means 'Little Brother'. Today I have come back to Kibera to find out what has happened to the children of Ndugu Mdogo over the last ten years.'
