As you enter the cinema a homeless guy David sits at the door begging. In the cinema his face appears on the screen before the main feature. He asks you the audience if they remembered him from outside then he tells the story of how he was helped off the streets. When as you leave the cinema David is outside once more collecting for the homeless charity.
