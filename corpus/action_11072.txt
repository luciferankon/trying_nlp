Maxx Yeager a former Navy Seal and now Commander of a clandestine organization only known as Cloak has seen the downfall of many governments sometimes contributing to it. After the devastating loss of his wife Debra Maxx agrees to one last mission before retiring to raise his daughter Pamela. With the aid of long time friend and CIA liaison Mason Turner Maxx and his Cloak team successfully eliminate terrorist forces and rescue a school of young Moroccan hostages. As fate would have it Maxx's last mission may not be the denouement of his career but instead force him into a new operation entirely. A Secret Society stronger than Cloak now looms above Maxx and his team giving them an ultimatum that may lead them all to glory or the collapse of our civilization as we know it.
