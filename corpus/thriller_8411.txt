This telling of the story of Jack the Ripper focuses not on the killings as much as on the aristocratic lives of the people connected to the heir-apparent to the throne of England... who of course is the Ripper. It tells also of the investigator who dares to charge this man with such crimes and of his love for a witness to one of the brutal slayings. In 1888 in London a prostitute is slaughtered on the street. The Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Jim Hansen is in charge of the investigation and realizes that the killer is a person with skill in dissection. Hansen belongs to the lower class and aspires to socially climb. Soon there are other murders and the ex-prostitute Florry Lewis witnesses the killer killing a prostitute and is forced to go to the precinct to provide a lead to the Scotland Yard. Inspector Hansen assigns Sgt. Tommy Bell to protect Florry and he investigates the murder cases. Prince Albert Victor who is the heir of the throne of England becomes his prime suspect but his chief Sir Charles Warren tells that they need to have strong evidences against the prince to proceed the case. Sir Warren decides to use Florry as bait but Inspector Hansen has fallen in love with her and objects. But his chief makes clear that this is the only way to stop the ripper. What will Inspector Hansen do?
