A grumpy old man seems to have one foot in the grave.His unscrupulous nephew and wife want to buy his valuable property in return for a life annuity;but without the family's knowingthe shrewd insurance agent does it first. Anyway the old man is not in a hurry to leave for the next world.In a chic Swiss clinic there's a miracle doctor who's got a marvelous cure (induced hibernation).When he returnshis wifea holier-than-thou old woman says it is Satan's magic;the nephews are disappointed .The rejuvenated uncle does not leave it at that:he hires a secretary to write his memoirs (or so he says).
