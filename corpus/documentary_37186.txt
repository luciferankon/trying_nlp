Every year for the past 26 years a courageous team of semi-professional wrestlers goes on what has been called the toughest wrestling tour on Earth. Rookies with stars in their eyes join tough-as-nails veterans like Chi-Chi Cruz Leatherface Eric the Lumberjack and Crash Crimson to pack into a van and head for the far northern reaches of Manitoba. Only accessible in winter by frozen lake roads these remote First Nations communities get a rare show of live wrestling entertainment complete with stunners and body slams. Wrestling with the North captures all the pain glory and determination of these die-hard wrestlers and through the wrestlers' eyes we glimpse northern aboriginal communities holding fast to their traditions while embracing a pop-culture circus with zeal.
