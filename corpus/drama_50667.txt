IDLE TIMES has been described as a new-age crime drama told in a way that you have not seen before. Built around a stellar cast the story picks up with two business families bidding on a city contract that would shift the balance of power to whomever wins the contract. From that point we are introduced to a diverse group of characters as the viewers are taken on a roller coaster ride of emotions.
