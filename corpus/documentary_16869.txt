Young people play a vital role in catalyzing change and the Young Voices for the Planet films document earnest youth who are helping solve the climate crisis by speaking out and reducing CO2 while addressing a range of environmental issues with win-win solutions. Save Tomorrow is the 10th Young Voices for the Planet film. It documents three 9-year-old girls who are concerned about climate change and feel that the adults have let them down. But after seeing the kids in the other Young Voices for the Planet films (their peers who they can identify with) they come to believe that maybe they can make a difference too. They testify at their town meeting and help overturn a regulation prohibiting solar panels on town buildings. Subsequently Lexington Massachusetts installs solar panels on all the town buildings. For these girls this is only the beginning. As one of the Save Tomorrow team Mari McBride says "find your team! Find your passion! Find your power!"
