Everybody loves Julia Lambert she is so charming she is so elegant she is so irresistible... But Julia has problems. She is married to Michel a stage producer such an understanding man but also a little of a bore (although she will never admit it). She wants to be loved by all but she is (adorably) vain and self-centered. She is aging (just slightly) and at forty she is beginning (unconsciously) to ask herself questions. And now she has Fallen in love with Paul Fernois a handsome young man (only) a few years her junior. But Paul more interested in climbing up the social ladder than in her personality soon gets attracted to a cute upcoming actress...
