The second in the six-tape set All the King's Men Rocket Ride to Stardom delves into Elvis's life from his birth in a two-room shack in Tupelo Mississippi through his much-anticipated return home from his military tour of duty in Germany. Out of informal after-dinner-like roundtable discussions among five members of his infamously close entourage come anecdotes answering such burning questions as the "real" story behind the spelling of his middle name and how Elvis developed the moves that made him Elvis the Pelvis. All in all this video offers an interesting look at his life from 1935 to 1960 leaving the viewer craving to continue the tale with the next installment.
