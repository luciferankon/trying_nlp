Muito Gelo e Dois Dedos D'Água is a crazy romantic comedy that combines some delicious touches of dark humor and hilarious police persecutions. Everything comes with an amazing soundtrack of the greatest hits of the Brazilian pop music of the late eighties involving the movie in a very sensual atmosphere. The story is not realistic; it is more cartoons like. As a matter of fact the introduction is an animation using the "The Simpsons" and "South Park" styles. In Maceió the dysfunctional pothead Roberta who was abused by her mates in the elementary school has a deep hatred against her grandmother Judite because of her treatment in the summer holidays of her childhood and adolescence. She kidnaps Judite and puts her in the trunk of her car; then she visits her sister Suzana who is scheduling the birthday party with a clown for her son and she prepares some shots to dope Judite. While waiting for Suzana on the street Roberta goes to a bar to calm down drinking whisky and she meets the dumb lawyer Renato who has just been stolen. Roberta creates a big mess in the bar and they do not pay the check; while escaping from the police she invites Renato to travel with her sister and her to her grandmother's beachside home for the weekend. When Renato discovers that the sisters plot revenge and plan to torture Judite to get even he tries to convince the girls to call off their plan. Meanwhile Suzana's husband Francisco finds the drugs in a desk in his bedroom and decides to chase his wife believing that Roberta is persuading Suzana to use drugs getting into serious trouble.
