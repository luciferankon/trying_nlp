Millionaire William van Luyn falls in love with his secretary Joan Thayer and marries her. Her family part of "the great middle class" (as blowhard nephew Henry keeps reminding us) is happy for Joan but reluctant to take charity from Will. He moves in with them and they keep resisting until one day he takes drastic action.
