Two sisters Amrit and Nimrit were raised in the royal palace at Amritgarh where their family ruled for many generations. Amrit the elder sister was brought up as the heir to a royalty whose glory days was well past them. She was a mirror personality of her grandmother the Rajmata. Amrit believed marriage was the only opportunity to salvage the lost honor of her family. Nimrit on the other hand was just the opposite. She did not take her lineage too seriously and thought from her heart rather than her head. Amrit got the opportunity to either choose the rich Adhiraj who also had royal background or Tej a disciplined soldier who not was wealthy or aristocratic but a man with a big heart.
