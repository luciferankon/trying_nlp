The life story of His Holiness Karmapa XVI is told by those close to him in Tibet the generation of teachers that he trained and many others that he touched. The story of this modern day buddha looks closely at enlightened qualities. It frames them amid historical events and the cultural context of Buddhism's migration to the West. We lost this larger than life figure at the age of 57 from cancer. Karmapa himself was the teaching lesson. How he lived and how he died gives us the example of an awakened being a person with a noble heart.
