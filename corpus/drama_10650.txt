Jake who has moved from a homogeneous town to an ethnically diverse school must navigate a new world of conflicting messages. Richard the school's basketball star must decide whether to live up to an African-American jock label and label other people in turn or to be himself and see others as multi-dimensional people. Lina a smart student who has endured the effects of hate against Hispanics must come to terms with her own biases. And Tisha part African-American and part Vietnamese must reconcile her cultures at home and at school. Can your decisions prevent a murder from happening?
