As the title suggests this Flemish comedy format is just a vehicle for comedian Chris Van den Durpel to star in successive unrelated sketches as a whole series of recurring stock-characters almost unrecognizable under heavy make up and distortions of voice and manner such as Kamiel Spiessens (a boorish commoner) Paul Schampers (parody on journalist and presenter Paul Jambers) Belgian royal Prince Laurent Flemish 'art pope' Jan Hoet notoriously gross and sarcastic Flemish novelist Herman Brusselmans boxer Firmin Crets ostentatious queer Ronny King and gay Boys band-airhead Kevin.
