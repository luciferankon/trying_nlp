Uncle Joe is ageing. He's also a millionaire. That's why his family is trying so very hard to get into his good books. They all want a piece of his empire. Unfortunately Uncle Joe isn't as stupid as his family thinks he is. He can see that his family is only nice to him because they want his money. Along comes Daniel McTeague a struggling bowler imported from another city by his family to put an end to this ridiculous situation. The fight won't be easy though because the poor family has a little bit of competition - A beautiful nurse who takes care of Uncle Joe (and no doubt would love to take care of his bank account). Who gets all the money? An extremely wealthy and crafty old man (Douglas) toys with his greedy nieces and nephews as they circle about waiting for their ill-deserved inheritance. The plot thickens as the old man takes a young mistress (d'Abo) and they fear that she will get the estate. In response they locate the much-loved nephew (Fox) who walked away from the whole greed thing and became a professional bowler. Deception upon deception complicates matters as young Daniel is slowly drawn back under the spell of Greed.
