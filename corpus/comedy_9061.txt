Dinner of the Dons is a gangster-spoof about mob leaders meeting from all over the world in an Italian restaurant to discuss current and future business. The dinner meeting turns out to be a total disaster as two mob leaders are suspected to be traitors. Once the head Don Mario Lombardi (Theo Crisell) finds out about this the women are excused and the violence begins.
