My Hustler Boyfriend is a poetical tale of this couple's day in the life. Daily they sell drugs do sex work and look fabulous. Ben McCoy stars as a sassy tranny. Cedric Harper plays an urban thug. This short film is told in stills the film was originally shot in slides. A poignant voice-over carries the piece as well as a fancy street beat soundtrack.
