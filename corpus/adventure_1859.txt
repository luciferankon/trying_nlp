Winter Olympic gold medallist Amy Williams and World Champion Free-diver Tanya Streeter spend eight days fending for themselves in a remote corner of Botswana's Okavango Delta. They have to hunt and gather to supplement their emergency survival rations or they will go hungry and they have to collect boil and filter every last drop of the drinking water they needs to survive. Armed with a camera to film their adventure they are constantly on guard against attack from wild animals. Only minutes after they set off into the bush on their own they disturb a cheetah on a fresh kill. Terrified they don't take any meat from the kill and move swiftly on to their first campsite which is only a few hundred metres away. They have to collect boil and filter every last drop of the drinking water they need to survive from thick muddy water holes but working under the relentless African sun soon takes its toll on Amy who is violently sick. They have no luck hunting and the only food they gather is so bitter they can't eat it. Despite running low on energy they decide to spend three days in separate camps to experience what it's like to survive completely alone in the African bush. Eventually the lack of food get to them both and the medical team send in a message ordering them to tuck into their emergency rations. Refuelled they reunite for their last night in the wild and they finally catch some food - a catfish - and in the pandemonium that ensues Amy gets a fishing hook stuck deep in her forefinger. The next day after one final encounter with the African wildlife they strike camp and head for a rendezvous with the support team.
