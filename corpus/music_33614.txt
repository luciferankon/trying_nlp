The Royal Concertgebouw Amsterdam and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra are celebrating their 125th Jubilee Year. For their anniversary concert they invite Dutch avant-garde composer Louis Andriessen to write a new orchestral work. It takes Andriessen 7 years to accept the commission. And now just a week before the World Premiƒçre Louis meets the orchestra and chief-conductor Mariss Jansons for their first rehearsal. They only have five days to get it right.
