Beautiful billionaire Horny Fark (Jackie Stevens) owns Fark Industries - a multi-national corporation that produces high-tech sex toys such as the "Spank-O-Tron" and "Gargantuan Groper". While attending the International Adult Toy Show in far off Bacchustan Fark is captured by terrorist Abu Bu and forced to construct a nuclear-powered sex doll. Thanks to a makeshift suit of armor cobbled together from old sex toys Fark and fellow female captive and obliging bedmate Titsen are able to escape the evil clutches of Abu and his Weapons of Mass Penetration. However during her captivity Fark Industries VP Obgyn Stain (Darian Caine) has driven the company into bankruptcy with incompetent inventions including the cactus dildo and a five-foot Ben Wa ball. Fark and right-hand woman Bumper Boobs build a new and improved sex toy suit of armor which sports a deadly laser bra bullet-proof panties and long-lasting batteries. Piloting her helium-filled inflatable love doll back to Bacchustan Fark destroys planes tanks and women's hetero-only tendencies in one fell swoop.
