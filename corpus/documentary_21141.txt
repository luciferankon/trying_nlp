These were the first vivisection videos taken by an organization who wants to stop animal experiments. In 1981 Lifeforce Founder Peter Hamilton and camera person Chas Leckie travelled to numerous research laboratories throughout Canada. The goal was to expose the secretive experiments on animals. The public taxpayers and donors have a right to know. These same and/or similar experiments continue today.
