It's been said there are only two phases to any large military initiative; too early to tell and too late to stop. This was never truer than at the height of the cold war in the 1950s as America and the U.S.S.R. were locked in a lethal game of one-upmanship. It was in this perverse environment of loathing and paranoia that a small group of Canadian scientists began to design and build a flying saucer for the American military.
