Four thirty-something females take you deep into their personal love/hate roller coaster lives from inside Cherry Hill South Jersey. Meet Tara a washed up triple threat thespian who won a major court case and now lives in the glamorous world of Cherry Hill. As she struggles to regain her mojo in her acting career this alcoholic mother of three has a special way of expressing her emotions. Her BFF Stacy the entrepreneur of the crew has a potential investor on board on her new party hat for large dogs clothing line or does she? Watch out! The beautiful bar owner Michelle married to gangster rapper Cooley G is the feisty one of the group. And of course there is Leslie the token Asian housewife of the crew. Be careful!
