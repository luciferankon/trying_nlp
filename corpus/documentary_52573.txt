8th August 2009. The flood caused by a typhoon destroyed Jiaxian. Children in Jiaxian Elementary School fought to bring the honour back in the tug-of-war games. Their courage inspired the adults whose faith was swept away by the flood. In addition a group of mothers who came from other countries live here. With the traditional food of their countries and their beautiful singing they inject the energy into the community.
