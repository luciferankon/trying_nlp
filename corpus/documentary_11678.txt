The upper stream of Hongjecheon has a long history. This region has been called different names in different eras. Its namesakes have been buildings in nearby areas all of which now disappeared; places like the Shinyoung Shopping Complex which was dismantled; Baeksukdongcheon an area now under restoration plan; Segumjeong an already-restored building. Buildings are not the only objects of restoration. The history of Segumjeong and Hongjecheon was also restored. Perhaps everything the film shows may be a kind of restoration.
