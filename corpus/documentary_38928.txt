'This is Exile' is an extraordinary intimate portrait of child refugees forced to flee from the violence of Syria's civil war to neighbouring Lebanon. Filmed over a year by the Emmy-award winning director Mani the documentary tells the stories of the children's lives in their own words and captures the moving truth of how they deal with loss hardship and the poignancy of dashed hopes.
