The film follows two strangers who meet on a 14-hr flight from Sydney to Los Angeles. Adam is a world-famous composer but Melody doesn't recognize her flight companion seated next to her. Along the way they pour their hearts out forging a connection that is more beautiful precisely because of its simple fleeting nature.
