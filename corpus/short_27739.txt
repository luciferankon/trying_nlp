I found this film in an old attic in the remote town of my late grandfather. The house was half caved in but I saw an old metal film tin. Inside was this footage deteriorated but in salvageable condition. Digitally remastering the film cost a small fortune but it was worth the trouble. It was the raw footage but I believe I was able to reconstruct the story truthfully. After a lot of research I found an odd biography about the main actor Israel Cuhen in the archives of an Argentinean library more on that another time. What is so stunning is that no one cares about my find.
