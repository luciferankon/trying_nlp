Nitoy Adriano is probably one of the most underrated and most unrecognizable lead guitarists in the Philippines in the past 40 years. However for those who know him he is considered an idol and a legend. Pepe Smith calls him "the silent one". Ely Buendia considers him a mentor. Noel Cabangon has only good words for his unique guitar playing. Lolita Carbon says he plays the guitar from the heart. And Ira Cruz considers him a miracle man on his red guitar. For years he has showed the music scene his unique way of playing his iconic red Stratocaster guitar.
