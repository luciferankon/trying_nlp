In the 1950s Frankie Howerd the famous radio and film comedian meets a young waiter Dennis Heymer who like himself is a closet homosexual. Their relationship blossoms into a partnership rather than a purely sexual one and Dennis becomes Frankie's manager. By the early 1960s however things are looking bleak for Frankie. He has lost popularity with mainstream audiences and suffered a nervous breakdown. He is full of self hatred about his appearance - he wears a wig - and his homosexuality puts huge stress on his relationship with Dennis. Matters are not helped by the death of Frankie's mother Edith. However Frankie is able to reinvent himself as a satirical comedian with a gig at Peter Cook's Establishment Club and his fortunes soar with successful television comedies and a well-publicized appearance at the Oxford Union.
