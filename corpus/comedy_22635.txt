Kate & Co. a farcical look at Corporate America. Kate & Co. "Even in a small town there's room for everyone." Everyone in Bristol knows good-hearted Kate as a long lost relative trying to make a new start by opening a 'mom & pops' style coffee shop in this franchise free small town. She quilts herself into the fabric of this esoteric community by befriending the locals with homespun stories of a fictitious past but a 'dark' secret brews in her house of 'carbs.' Would the town approve if they knew her true identity as the front-woman for Organic Hearth a coffee and baked goods conglomerate taking root in their back yard? When Kate begins to fall in love with the quaint little town (and Sam the local deputy!) she wonders what life in Bristol would be like if she made all of her lies come true. You think you know the real story behind America's coffee addiction? In 1993 one "woman" set out to do things a little bit different... and the world never looked at a muffin quite the same way again. "In a town that's chock full of nuts a coffee ground war is about to brew over." Everyone in Bristol RI knows good-hearted "Kate" as a long lost relative trying to make a new start by opening a 'mom & pops' style coffee shop in this franchise free small town. She quilts herself into the fabric of this esoteric community by befriending the locals with homespun stories of a fictitious past but a 'dark' secret brews in her house of 'carbs.' Would the town approve if they knew "her" true identity? Not only is she the front-woman for Organic Hearth a coffee and baked goods conglomerate taking root in their back yard but she's also...A HUGE DRAG QUEEN!!! When "Kate" begins to fall in love with the quaint little town (and Sam the local deputy!) she wonders what life in Bristol would be like if she made all of her lies come true.
