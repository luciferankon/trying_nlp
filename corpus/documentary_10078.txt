In 2007 filmmaker Fraser C. Heston discovered a cache of lost footage shot by adventure-author Milt Machlin during his expedition to the cannibal coast of New Guinea in 1969 in search of the lost scion Michael Rockefeller. The film includes previously unreleased footage and eye-witness interviews including some startling revelations which shed new light on the unsolved mystery of Michael's disappearance. In the tradition of Werner Hertzog's "Grizzly Man" director Fraser Heston has created an entirely new film from Milt Machlin's unedited epic documentary. The disappearance of Michael Rockefeller is one of the enduring unsolved mysteries of the 20th Century. In 1961 Michael Rockefeller left on a voyage down the cannibal coast of New Guinea in a trading canoe. Several miles off shore heavy seas swamped his craft. After a night adrift Rockefeller set out to swim for the distant shore leaving his companion with the fateful words: "I think I can make it..." He was never seen again. Or was he? Author and journalist Milt Machlin on a wild lead went to New Guinea in 1969 to find him. "If by the remotest flight of fancy Donahue's story should be true Michael Rockefeller would have to be found. I was determined to be the one to do it." - Milt Machlin.
