Non-place/Other Space is a compilation video work based on my many years of visual ethnography whereby I walked the city and collected images as a personal video diary. This work compiles fragments of the city space in Hong Kong and Macao (1991-2008) to assert the possibility of many spaces and temporal sheets in one single framed discourse. It attempts the states between disappearance and emerging visible and concealed. "Walking through" is a precarious experience. One penetrates dives into emerges and immerses in... In one moment I see therefore the video camera records for me; in another moment the camera sees and retains then I discover. Automatism leads. Virtual sounds I barely grasp in my mind and fragments of a voice I have long forgotten all blended into the placeless other space of non-place. Places and lived moments of disappearance return as the in-between neither monumental nor illusionary.
