Reunions are a time of friendship and remembrance. Unfortunately for the six people attending a party in the quiet country side it is also a time for insanity and murder. Come along as a group of friends attempt to stay alive among the shattered pieces of friendships and marriage. As night falls and unseen forces conspire against them a show of compassion may spell their end while allegiances against a common foe are tested against our own human nature. As the darkness falls around them and the walls seem to close in their greatest enemy may just be themselves will they make it...through the night?
