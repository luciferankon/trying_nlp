WTTV Channel 4 Bloomington Indiana had purchased the "shock theater" package from Universal Studios and had originally aired it as Shock Theater and only included only still photographs punctuated by voice-over narrations by Bob during the commercial break. A sponsor told the station that they wanted the voice of Bob Carter to host the new Nightmare Theater. Bob invented the horror host Sammy Terry and the rest is history. The movies in the package were The Black Cat Calling Dr. Death The Cat Creeps Chinatown Squad Danger Woman A Dangerous Game Dead Man's Eyes Destination Unknown Dracula Dracula's Daughter Enemy Agent Frankenstein Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man The Frozen Ghost The Great Impersonation Horror Island House of Horrors The Invisible Man The Invisible Man Returns The Invisible Ray The Last Warning The Mad Doctor of Market Street The Mad Ghoul Man Made Monster The Man Who Cried Wolf The Mummy The Mummy's Ghost The Mummy's Hand The Mummy's Tomb Murders in the Rue Morgue The Mystery of Edwin Drood The Mystery of Marie Roget Mystery of the White Room Night Key Nightmare Night Monster Pillow of Death The Raven Reported Missing!
