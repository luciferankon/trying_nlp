Once deemed "The most dangerous city west of the Santa Fe" Los Angles was the original 'Wild West'. The incessant hankering of Americans to migrate west for profit and prosperity also brought with it people who had a strong desire to find a place where they had the freedom to be themselves: in short people in search of a better life. A true American virtue if ever one was and Gays & Lesbians were no exception. Queer culture and it's historyis riddled with discrimination suppression and despair; but also triumph and human spirit. And out of all of it emerged a unique identity and culture. But where did this culture come from? When and where did it begin to take shape? How has it evolved into what we see today? LAQH seeks to answer these questions by shedding light on a part of American history and historical figures who are largely unacknowledged and in turn create a newfound dialogue about not only LGBTQ history but how our Gay and Lesbian brothers and sisters effected the world we live in today; which will ultimately create a better understanding of the truly unique and utterly American culture of the Lesbian Gay Bisexual & Transgender community. Most consider the NY Stonewall Riots of 1969 to be the birth of the Gay civil rights movement. But there have been activists artists and innovators in L.A. since the turn of the 20th century. From the beloved male and female impersonators who graced the vaudeville stages of the early 1900's to the Queer designers and artists behind the scenes who made Hollywood the glamour capital of the world to the wide spread mid-century criminalization of Gays and Lesbians and the brave ones who began to fight back resulting in groundbreaking L.A. based organizations which sparked the Gay civil rights movement across the country and the world.
