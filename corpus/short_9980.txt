This film is based on a true story of five guys termed the "two percent" by their Nutley New Jersey high school principal in 1968. We've all heard the speech in a crowded auditorium of how 60% of the class goes on to college 25% join the "blue collar" work force those that drop out and then there's that 2% that is only interested in parties and eventually amounts to nothing! Well this story is about these guys who against all odds become not only successful in their careers and are also major contributors to their communities.
