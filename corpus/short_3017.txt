A young man faces the camera and removes his shirt. He stretches his neck and then proceeds to hold a series of simple gestures; a subscript identifies each. "Cardboard box" "feeding chickens" "washing dishes" "rollercoaster" and so forth. Then an off-camera voice cues disco music and the man puts the gestures together: voil≈ï he's dancing! A strobe light completes the scene.
