According to the Armenian medieval legend St. Karapet (John the Baptist) before being beheaded cursed the women forbidding them to approach his grave. However a girl named Houri goes on a pilgrimage to the grave of the Saint and grows a tail and beard. Thus she is condemned to eternally serve to the grave of the saint. The opening of the film shows the arrival of the relics of St. Karapet for reburial. Houri with her devoted companion Loshtak (arm. The lop-eared) appears in the presidential hall. Here begins the tragedy; the eternal spirit of love appearing in our loveless reality destructs and disappears.
