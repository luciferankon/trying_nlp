Deborah Shaffer directs this Spanish-language (with English subtitles) documentary of the aftermath of the brutal political repression wreaked upon Chile by General Augusto Pinochet in the 1970s and 1980s. His military dictatorship rounded up and arrested thousands of innocent people some of whom were tortured and executed and some of whom simply vanished and are became known as the "disappeared." This film documents the efforts of relatives of the "disappeared" to get information on their loved ones from Pinochet's regime. Footage includes harrowing interviews with the women and children of those who never returned home. Shaffer discusses the problems of attaining justice for the abduction torture and death of the prisoners. Musical star Sting who with human rights group Amnesty International brought international attention to the situation performs his hit song "They Dance Alone" with Peter Gabriel in concert.
