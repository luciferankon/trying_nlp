IRREPLACEABLE seeks to ask the important question "What is family?" and "Does 'family' still matter in today's society?" The film's host (Tim Sisarich Executive Director of Focus on the Family - New Zealand) seeks to find out whether the adage "If family fails society fails" is true. He explores the idea of family with experts around the globe to determine whether the concept of the traditional family is meaningful or in fact outmoded. And if it is meaningful is family worth preserving even fighting for? On the journey he hopes to discover why all humans have a yearning to be in family - to be a part of something - and what forces contribute to the breakdown of family. A number of outstanding experts and commentators speak on a range of topics including: loss of marital permanence untethered sexuality fatherlessness/decline of men and anti-natality. To help unpack these issues Tim examines the origins and history of the family structure through an array of lenses and cultures.
