Lule Bib Luka is one of the last of her kind - the burrnesha of Albania - sworn virgins who reject a conventional women's life to take a male role. Lule has devoted years to caring for her paternal lands and livestock in Albania's rugged mountains. Now in her seventies after the rest of her family have either died or left their homeland she decides to move to the city. This crafted doc captures the death of tradition in the face of modernity.
