A protest journal in two chapters spreading over seven years. I document my life through demonstrations. From the failed social protest of summer 2011 to the weekly demos against the Separation Wall in the village of Ni'lin. The film describes changes in the Israeli society as it descends into depths of racism and hatred along with the personal price demanded by social activism in general and in the Palestinian village in particular.
