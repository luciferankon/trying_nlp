In this first encounter with film I was seduced by its presence -- tangible dancing with particles fragmented and reconfigured on a reel. The spliced shots if cut by an amateur hand leave gaps and fissures -- a jumble of moments in new rhythm. They form a topography strung out visible in motion spinning before light. To voice this experience with 16mm I turned to fragments of a different sort. Echoing a documentary practice I extracted bits from books I was reading at the time rearranging them into a script. In their new form disjointed from their original contexts and made linear by my narration the words of Baudrillard Calvino Dillon and Flusser speak to the images and the filmmaking process.
