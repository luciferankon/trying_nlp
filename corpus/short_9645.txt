In days gone by young housewives had their needs and local tinkerers-the Tinmen-helped fill them. Making a living doing odd jobs and working his pushcart filled with pots pans tools and a grinding stone our Tinman comes down the same street each afternoon and the ladies ready themselves to greet him. Even with the attention of all the neighborhood women the Tinman only has eyes for the Butcher's daughter or does he? The Butcher can't stand how his customers fawn over the young man and won't let his daughter visit this playboy's cart. The young lovers find subtle ways to further their flirtation.
