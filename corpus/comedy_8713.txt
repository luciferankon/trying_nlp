Zeki and Metin two villagers from Egin travel to Istanbul for the first time to take Metin's arranged bride. While admiring the Bosporus a publicity agent takes a photograph of them which is later to be an a publicity stunt called 'What Are These Men Looking At?'. While our two stooges are wandering in Istanbul they find a wounded man (who they are lead to believe is dead) and think that they'd be hanged for murder. Meanwhile the publicity agency looks for them to make them commercial film artists.
