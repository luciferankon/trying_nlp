The film tells the story of a long dead man who was crushed chewed and spit out by the diligent cruel but not really effective Hungarian judicatory system. We can wonder how obstinately without being picky in terms of tools and methods an innocent man was made guilty. We can only hope that only unlucky co- incidents and not the inner logic of the system are responsible for ruining a whole life.
