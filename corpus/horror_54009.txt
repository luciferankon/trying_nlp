A woman stumbles through the woods naked covered in blood with no recollection what might have happened to her or who she is. She reaches a cabin that seems vaguely familiar and once inside some memories come back memories of violence and rape. She seems to remember she has been pregnant recently but there's no trace of this now - only something in a jar that might be her aborted fetus. She finds a dismembered corpse in the cabin whom she believes to be her lover...and that is when her descent into madness really begins.
