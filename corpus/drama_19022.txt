The movie rather presents a map of its main character's mind than a story. Realistic scenes mix with dream sequences and hallucinations. The realistic episodes feature Gabrielle a young woman living in a trailer on a beach in northern france. She works in a bar drinks a little too much and is a big fan of aging rock/blues singer Lennox. A more dreamlike storyline shows seemingly the same woman disorientatedly wandering through an American city and meeting Lennox after a concert.
