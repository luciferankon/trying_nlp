FINGERED is an art film that's constructed like a regular movie. Lydia Lunch plays a phone sex operator/prostitute that gets together with a guy she's been on the phone with. After a semi-hardcore sex scene the violence begins. The man cuts someone's throat for looking at Lydia's character then they go for a drive. The two abduct a hitch hiker and rape her in a junkyard.
