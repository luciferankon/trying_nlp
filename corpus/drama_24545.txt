During the rehearsals for their new play Robert J端rgensen (Will Quadflieg) and his wife Gisela Ahrens (Heidemarie Hatheyer) recognize their former theater manager Conrad Schroeter (Heinrich George) in the prompt box as the new prompter. J端rgensen once ruthlessly seduced Schroeter's only daughter Inge even though he already was bound to Gisela who yet was pregnant at that time. In great desperation Inge committed suicide. In the midst of a performance with J端rgensen Schroeter was informed about the death of his child. Horrified he attacked J端rgensen and accused him for murder. Schroeter then was committed into a mental clinic. Now Robert and Gisela are afraid if Schroeter can handle the new re-encounter.
