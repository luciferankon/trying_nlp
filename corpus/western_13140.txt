After years of wandering Tim returns to Sagebrush where he is suspected of murder and the conflict between him and Sheriff Hurley is reignited. After Tim beats Hurley in a wrestling match he goes to the bank to collect. But Hurley and banker Blackton taking money from the bank claim Tim robbed the bank. Another one of the many many Columbia Pictures westerns that were sold to Gail Pictures for television distribution that has the original title frame missing --- the correct title is "The Whirlwind" as shown on the original prints --- and cast/crew sheets redone with the result that the Gail prints left off some credited players and role names. This of course allows some contributors who have seen only the title and cast/crew frames as shown on the Gail prints to submit an incorrect cast order and some incorrect "uncredited" attributes beside the names of players who were credited on the original Columbia frames that were replaced by the highly-error ridden and badly-redone Gail credit frames. A good rule of thumb for those who rely on the Gail prints to be accurate is... don't. And never verify a cast/crew as being complete based on the Gail prints that evidently left off Walt Coburn as the author (story) and show only Stuart Anthony who did the adaptation as the sole writer.(Well verify them if you want to especially those who think the Gail prints are the last word in accuracy but you'll be wrong and also be providing a disservice to film historians who care about accuracy.) That is an assumptionreference only one writer credited on the Gail print that is not used here since Anthony's name is the only one currently shown on site as a writer.The credited cast in cast order as shown on the original Columbia credit frames was: Tim McCoyAlice DahlPat O'MalleyJ.Carrol NaishMatthew BetzJoseph G. Girard (billed as Joe Girard) Lloyd Whitlock William McCall (billed as Bill McCall) Stella Adams Theodore Lorch (billed as Ted Lorch) and Mary Gordon. And by the way the Gail prints are missing some original footage.
