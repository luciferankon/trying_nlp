Based out of Brooklyn KiKi and Claude is a throwback to the golden age of comedy but at the same time they never let you forget the times we are living in. This is a show that the world needs to see and is definitely a breath of fresh air. It's a break from the lack of true comedy in sitcoms that television has been missing.
