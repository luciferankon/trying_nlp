It's hard to catch a break in Boston--especially when you're a twenty-something working class girl. Meet Courtney Kristina Noelle and Val--four girls trying to get it together in a world of bad boyfriends dead-end jobs and parents who just don't understand. But in a town that can be tough and unforgiving this group of friends isn't going down without a fight. When single mom Courtney decides she wants to go to beauty school she finds out the hard way that she needs her GED to do it. Val tries to overcome a criminal record by interviewing for an internship with one of the richest women in Boston. And Kristina and Noelle put their feet down with their noncommittal boyfriends. Will they step up to the plate?
