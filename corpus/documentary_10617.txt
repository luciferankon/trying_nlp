A documentary look at the life and kidnapping of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl - "Danny" to his family friends and colleagues. Through interviews and home movies a portrait of a talented young man emerges - a musician a recently married husband about to become a father and a tough-minded investigative journalist. One of his kidnappers Omar Sheikh is also profiled: born in England well-schooled motivated perhaps by the desire to embarrass Pakistan's president who was cooperating with the United States in the aftermath of 9/11. We visit the caf√© in Karachi where Pearl was kidnapped. We see the site of his assassination. Loss colors all.
