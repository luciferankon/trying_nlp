Captain Morten Hansen is sailing the 3rd time from Bremerhaven to Greenland but this time he will go further north than ever before. The captain wants to lead his passengers up to Ilulissat Icefjord the most productive glacier in the northern hemisphere. Every day the Kangia-glacier edges around 40 meters of ice into the fjord. But first of all they have to cross the Atlantic ocean a pretty stormy sea and therefore Morten Hansen has to fight against 10-meter-waves. In Greenland there is time to visit nice spots and interesting people in Sisimiut Quasigianguit Quaqortoq Aasiat and Nuuk. The foreign minister Aleqa Hammond is talking about challenges: global warming will change everything in Greenland. The Icebergs are melting away even in the celebrated Ilulissat Icefjord.
