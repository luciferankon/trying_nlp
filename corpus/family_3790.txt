Real Strength is an original half-hour series made for Halogen TV. It follows health and fitness coach Jeremy Shore as he introduces us to men and women who not only excel physically but pay their health forward to create stronger communities. The coaches volunteers and athletes profiled on the show may be recognized for their physical achievements but it's their performance outside the gym and off the field that matters. Their drive and motivation comes from those they help including the physically challenged like we see in the pilot episode. In each episode Jeremy takes part with the goal to inspire challenge and motivate viewers to get fit and get involved.
