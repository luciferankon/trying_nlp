A woman appears and takes different bottles of perfume from a table and pours it on a flower pot and immediately up sprouts the stalk then the flowers appear in their places. Next is a transformation scene in which a lot of loose petals and leaves appear before our eyes and each petal takes its respective place and forms the flower then the leaves and stalks squirm around for their place in the background and before we can realize it they form a beautiful wreath. This same performance is repeated with all sorts of pretty roses carnations lilies lilacs and a number of others too numerous to mention. As the wreaths are formed we see pretty faces appear in miniature in the center and they form a becoming frame to the artistic setting. Finally a lot of leaves hang over the side of the urn and then fold up forming a head of cabbage and when they unfold there to our astonishment is the head of a grotesque being who amuses with his funny faces till like all the rest he disappears from our view.
