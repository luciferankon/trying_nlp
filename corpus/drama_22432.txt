On Twitter Sukmo is a cool smart guy and full of confidence. He looks handsome on his twitter time-line making Sukmo easily accessible to anyone including Hanum a pretty and well-established journalist. Their relationship getting closer makes Sukmo who lives in Yogyakarta decide to meet Hanum in Jakarta for the sake of exploring a commitment. Apparently Sukmo had to deal with the fact that in the real world everything is not as easy and simple. His confidence collapsed when he saw the approaching figure of Hanum truly beautiful and elegant in contrast to himself - who is only handsome in the time-line. So postponing his meeting with Hanum Sukmo determined to change himself into a Jakarta "guy". Working at Belo's Internet caf√© he says he is a communications consultant trying to become the man he thinks will be most appropriate to accompany Hanum. Is everything imagined by Sukmo in accordance with what Hanum desires?
