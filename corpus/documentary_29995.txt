When you drop off a bag of dirty laundry who's doing the washing and folding?  THE WASHING SOCIETY brings us into New York City laundromats and the experiences of the people who work there by observing these disappearing neighborhood spaces and the continual intimate labor that happens there. The juxtaposition of narrative and documentary elements in THE WASHING SOCIETY creates a dream-like yet hyper-real portrayal of a day in the life of a laundry worker both past and present. Note: This is a fine cut awaiting sound mix completed credits and color grading.
