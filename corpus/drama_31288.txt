The mining district of Cobalt Ontario is the setting for the greater share of the picture and there is careful attention paid to the scenes taken on board the millionaire's yacht when Gresham is determined to get to his bank in time to prove to the clearing house committee that he is solvent and in so doing foils the Baylis attempt to take his mine away from him. It is not alone for the control of the mine that there is a struggle but there is a girl in the story who is sought after by the two big men. Alice Chandler is worth the struggle. For a long time there seems little hope for Gresham but the great moment comes when he is able to save Alice's life by carrying her to safety through a wild day in which they both are at the mercy of the overflowing waters from a dam.
