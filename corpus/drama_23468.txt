Willy Doyle comes to the big city with two objectives: landing a job and finding a man. The first is relatively easy for the published Ph.D.: she's hired to teach a university English course. The second is harder- not because Willy can't find a man but because she has three to worry about. One is a smooth-talking student (Nicholas Campbell) who's interested in after-hours tutoring. Willy agrees to help- though she knows his intentions are far from academic. Colleague John Trueman is a more likely prospect. He's helpful handsome and witty but seems intent on keeping Willy at arm's length. Most puzzling is Archie the elderly department head. He's usually gruff - often downright rude - but there are times when Willy suspects he may be a kindred spirit.
