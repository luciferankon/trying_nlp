An Armenian photographer's archives whose ancestors introduced photography to the ancient city of Tabriz in 1900 could be in jeopardy. There are over thousand photographs of historic significance in his archives which reflect the lives of the Moslem and Christian communities of Tabriz. Therefore no child to pass it on to the photographer needs to protect his national treasure.
