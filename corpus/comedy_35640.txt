A rag tag band of idiots on the verge of signing a recording contract is sandbagged by their lead singer Chas Knopfler into throwing the mother of all parties the night before they embark on a world tour. Eddie Mesmer the rhythm guitarist awakens to find his drummer Toss Dunbar hanging from a tree like a scarecrow and the house completely destroyed. Eddie and Toss quickly realize that A: they can't remember anything and B: there's a dead guy in the pool. Now they have to figure out what happened the night before or their Rock and Roll dream is over. Their only hope is State Dependent Learning which is the scientifically proven fact that information learned while under the influence of a given "substance" can only be recalled and used to solve a task when you are in the same state. Or in Layman's terms... They have to drink to remember. The prior night's debauchery comes back to them as they get Halfway to a Blackout against insurmountable odds. Will Bad Math realize they're greater than the sum of their parts in time to keep their mostly-virgin asses from jail and salvage their dream of rock superstardom? I'd tell you but I'm out of Vodka. A rock band wakes up to the results of a sex drugs and booze filled party and they don't remember a thing. Missing contracts bikini clad women a dead man in the pool and an epic hangover help them realize the only way to remember a blackout is to blackout again.
