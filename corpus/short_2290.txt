A comical pseudo-educational video. The artist plays a character learning to adapt to what he believes is the Dutch way of doing things. This cultural satire is based on the artist's own observations and experience of living in Holland and combines both spoken texts and performance. Written acted/performed directed and shot by the artist and edited entirely in-camera.
