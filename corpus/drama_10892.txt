Sadistic shower room confrontation unsanitary detention facilities and a tomblike prison cell become classrooms on the horrors of the human soul. As his fellow captives are tortured die or quietly lose their minds the naive 13-year-old becomes an unwilling witness to startling lessons in honor hatred conscience and survival. Contains nudity and mature themes.
