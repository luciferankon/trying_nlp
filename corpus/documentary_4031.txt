Allan Kessing was prosecuted for leaking customs reports about major security flaws at Sydney airport to the media. His reports he says had been buried for 30 months. When they surfaced the revelations resulted in a 200 million dollar overhaul of airport security. His supporters argue Kessing deserves a medal for his efforts but the government didn't agree - they thought a custodial sentence was more appropriate. Kessing now finds himself a convicted criminal.
