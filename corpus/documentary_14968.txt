In Deaf Jam Aneta Brodski seizes the day. She is a Deaf teen introduced to American Sign Language (ASL) poetry who then boldly enters the spoken word slam scene. In a wondrous twist Aneta an Israeli immigrant living in the Queens section of New York City eventually meets Tahani a hearing Palestinian slam poet. The two young women embark on a hearing/deaf collaboration a performance duet that is a metaphor for the complex realities they share - generating a new form of slam poetry that speaks to both the hearing and the Deaf. Deaf Jam utilizes innovative techniques to convey the beauty of sign language poetry to hearing audiences and to honor the wishes of most of the characters that do not want to be artificially voiced. Simply "voicing" the poetry falls short because the poetry is not created on paper and then translated into sign language. It is a three dimensional language that exists like dance in space and utilizes cinematic concepts such as close-ups wide shots cuts and dissolves. In the hands of a talented poet shapes in relation to one another create the visually stunning equivalents of rhythm and rhyme.
