A bully and his victim find themselves lost in a fantasy world. Bemused and scared the travellers are calmed by the spirit who will take them on a journey to help them understand anger fear and loneliness. The musical featured in this programme was developed and performed by groups of pupils with special educational needs. At the end of the musical itself there are a few short workshops which can help classes who would like to try to produce the musical themselves.
