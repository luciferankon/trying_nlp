When Lonnie Edwards graduates from the University of Montevallo in Montevallo Alabama he does so as the university's first black student athlete. His skills as a collegiate basketball player with the school gets him invited to try-out with the 1971 - 1972 World Famous Chicago Bulls. The same year that Lonnie graduates college he is drafted by the United States Selective Service for military duty. He also becomes part of recruitment efforts by the U.S. Federal Education System to hire more black male teachers for employment as public educators. After being passed over by the Chicago Bulls due to his 1-A Draft Status with the US Selective Service Lonnie is offered an opportunity to become a first-year Physical Education [P.E.] teacher at Hooper Alexander Elementary School in DeKalb County Georgia. It is as a fifth-grade P.E. teacher that Lonnie's life is forever changed and where he meets little Nancy Johnson one of his fifth-grade students. Nancy is physically disabled and takes no interest in participating in Lonnie's P.E. class activities. Lonnie's early attempts to get Nancy to take part in a number of organized activities are unsuccessful. After Nancy provides Lonnie several unsubstantiated excuses for her lack of interest in participating Lonnie challenges not only himself but Nancy to own her physical deformity and ignore her fear of ridicule. Before Nancy's fifth-grade year ends and through encouragement from her fifth-grade P.E. teacher Nancy triumphs over her affliction. More than 2-decades after her time as a fifth-grade P.E. student in Lonnie Edwards' class Nancy writes a heart-felt letter to Sally Jessy Raphael popular 1990's Talk Show Host asking Sally for help locating Lonnie so she may publicly thank him for changing her life. This is their story.
