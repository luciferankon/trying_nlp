Filmed in former US military barracks and in the long-abandoned homes and circular library of Gary Snyder and Zen philosopher Alan Watts Off the Trail follows a central protagonist a soldier from another era as he performs a series of actions and rituals. The uniformed figure paints Chinese nature symbols chants meditates and wanders dreamlike through a rolling Californian landscape of fog-shrouded hills coastal defences and dense woodland valleys. Scenes are accompanied by haiku and poetry readings from Michael McClure and Gary Snyder and the disembodied voice of Alan Watts ruminating upon the passage of time and our perception of the 'wild'.
