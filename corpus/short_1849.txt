Salon is our 48 hour attempt at creating a Giallo (Italian horror/mystery). The film is about two sisters twin sisters that have spent their entire adult lives being leered at by perverts and being asked to do explicit things together. Finally one of them snaps or does she? Perverted men begin to die in some horrifying ways that's for sure. Giallo films feature several things striking art direction and of course the ominous black gloves! We hit all of those marks in this beautifully shot and art directed short film crafted in just 48 hours for the 48 Hour Film project.
