Reservation Soldiers is a one-hour documentary that takes a closer look at the complex relationship between the Canadian Forces and aboriginal youth. The military have pushed their recruitment drive into high gear and native youth represent the perfect untapped resource. Why are these teens so keen to join up? Is a career in the military the only way out? Is it really the best option for both? Filmed over the course of several years Reservation Soldiers focuses on the relationship between the Canadian military and aboriginal youth. For Blair Mahekan and Noel three teenage boys from remote Western Canadian reservations the military represents an opportunity they don't often see at home - adventure discipline and cold hard cash.

Aboriginal recruiter Sergeant Ron Leblanc knows exactly where they're coming from. After 16 years in the military he is facing a difficult decision; pursuing a career with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or "paying back" the military for helping him escape his troubled youth by shipping out to Afghanistan Canada's most dangerous mission since the Korean War. For these young men the Canadian military seems like the best option but is it the only option for their future?
