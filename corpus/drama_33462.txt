KAAL is about four women who are trapped in the world of human trafficking because of poverty. They move from a rural area into a large city after being abducted in various ways by the local middleman Ratan (Rudranil Ghosh). They ultimately become call-girls for the sake of survival. Ranidi (the boss played by Sandhya Shetty) grooms the depressed and oppressed girls and gives them a complete make over in a short time.
