Pierre Esteban is a middle-aged technology teacher divorced from Hélčne who has two children. Jeanne Lancry is a lively estate agent in the same situation : a divorcée with two children. They discover they love visiting empty apartments together and...more than just that! Life would be just wonderful if they were fifteen years earlier. But there are the children. It would be fine to live altogether in the same place. The question is : will the kids get on well with each other ?
