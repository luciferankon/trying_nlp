Dora is a spirit wandering through the netherworld looking for her lost child. She meets Edith her great-grandniece at the Well at the World's End and sees that Edith is about to make the same mistake that Dora herself did 70 years before--leave her husband and child for another man. Dora inhabits the body of an old servant and determines to stop Edith from ruining her life the way Dora did.
