York Pennsylvania has long been the quintessential salt-of-the-earth American town touting a proud cultural architectural and industrial history. But after a steady migration to the suburbs that began in the 1950s poverty crime and blight have become the city's current hallmarks straining its finances tarnishing its image and demoralizing its citizenry. In the midst of these challenges some have sought a revolution in York - an economic revolution. When municipal county and area business leaders unveiled a plan to level part of a low-income residential neighborhood and build a minor league stadium promising it to be the catalyst behind millions in urban redevelopment who could argue? But what happens to those who lived in this neighborhood and made way for stadium? Houses are built with wood and nails; brick and mortar. Homes however are built over time with family and memories; they are deeply associated with our sense of self and security. How are these intangible values assessed when one is compelled to move? This is the story of baseball urban redevelopment and the human cost of bringing them to York.
