Greece is covered in concrete tumors - yapi half-finished buildings left in permanent limbo skeletal structures like temples to some obscure future gods. People don't explicitly speak of them or really even seem to see them. They've just grown from the landscape a symptom of European change. Emerging from their obscurity the yapia grow to take on a life of their own. The future of their meaning and their moment are up for grabs.
