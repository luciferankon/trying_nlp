Guided by Liv Ullmann and with commentaries from a number of prominent filmmakers for whom Bergman is and remains an important influence - such as Woody Allen Olivier Assayas Bernardo Bertolucci Arnaud Desplechin John Sayles Martin Scorsese and Lars von Trier the film provides a vivid portrait of the artist who in each new project found a challenge for himself and for the people he worked with - both actors and colleagues behind the camera.
