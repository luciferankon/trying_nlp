Patrick a 40-year old Frenchman born and raised in Paris married an American woman and moved to San Francisco at age 25. After his father's recent death in Paris his French family pressures him to return to France in order to take over the family's business which he previously refused when he decided to move to the Bay Area. His sudden dilemna is representative of many French and American people who have settled in the other country: Can they go back home again and where is home anyway?
