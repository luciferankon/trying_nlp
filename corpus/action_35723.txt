Jump'n Bounce uses a unique combination of old-school gameplay and modern-day level design: You play as a constantly bouncing ball never standing still. Add to that the option of doing mid-air highjumps and downward bricksmash attacks and you get a very interesting combination of typical arcade games from the 80's and the modern platform games opening some unique challenges to overcome.
