A visit to the Navajo Indians in the Southwest. When the picture opens a lone horseman is seen at the top of a hill; then panoramic views of mesa and canyon. A group of Indians riding bareback passes. The commentator tells us that the Navajos once the greatest of Indian tribes are back on the land of their ancestors that they number 50000 and are increasing. There are scenes showing the beauty of the Painted Desert. An Indian on horseback herds a large flock of sheep; goats lead the sheep to safety as they approach the edge of the canyon. Two Indian boys walk toward their home which is made of clay laid over a frame of logs. The commentator remarks that still nomadic the Navajos follow their flocks in search of pastures and water. Women weave rugs of their own designs using dyes prepared from native roots. Then a sequence showing the Navajos on their way to an annual pow wow at Flagstaff. When they arrive the women unload the wagons and prepare the camp site while the men get ready for the rodeo contest. There are glimpses of the rodeo. After dark the Indians prepare for the tribal dance. All night long two Indians dance in a circle of chanting tribes- men while the tom-toms beat an accompaniment. The title is a misnomer since the film does not touch upon the tribal council meeting. Also the rodeo is not a typical contest.
