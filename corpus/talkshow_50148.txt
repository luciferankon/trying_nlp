Hosted by one of America's most recognized and likeable television personalities "The Tony Danza Show" is an entertaining one-hour talk show produced live daily from New York. Guests will include actors athletes news-makers and real people with interesting stories to tell. Tony will also highlight incredible kids and get into the kitchen to cook some of his own favorite family recipes. This show will occasionally extend beyond the studio as Tony gets up close and personal with people who are making a difference in our culture or just to have a little fun.
