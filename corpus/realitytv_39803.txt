Patent Bending is a Canadian reality television series that premiered August 22 2006 on the Discovery Channel. The series is based on building some of the weird fantastical ideas inventors have patented over the last century. Once physically realised the flaws in these ideas tend to be humorously obvious and explain the ideas' lack of commercial success. The team then tries to come up with an improved version thus the "bending" part of the title meeting with varying results.
