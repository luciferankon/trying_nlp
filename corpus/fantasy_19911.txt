The origin of all existence - place of Absolute Love Light Peace and Wisdom. The source of all existence - the King of Eternity who created the Land of Love and the Land of Light ruled by the Queen of Angels and the Prince of Peace. The choice of existence creates darkness and evil to be overcome by cultivating virtue in angelic beings who experience existence in a created reality called "life". By ascending from darkness to light enlightened souls reach their former abode - the Garden of Angels to re-unite with the soul-lights in harmony and eternal bliss.
