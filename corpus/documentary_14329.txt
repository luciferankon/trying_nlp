There is a wonderful village. It's called Rosia Montana (Verespatak). With several hundred-year-old houses. People who stick by their land house churches dead relations. The surrounding mountains contain 300 tons of gold and silver. Rosia Montana Gold Corporation a Canadian-Romanian company wants to open a goldmine here. State-of-the-art technology. Open cast mining. People are being moved into new modern houses. Their former homes are to be destroyed. There will be gold. There will be silver. This will be a new Eldorado. A remarkable offer. There will also be an 800-hectare cyanide waste reservoir with a 180-meter-high dam. Only this beautiful village Rosia Montana will disappear from the face of the Earth. A village called Rosia Montana (Verespatak in Hungarian) is going to be eradicated because it is situated near mountains containing 300 tons of gold and silver. Hundred-year old houses graveyards and churches will be destroyed people living there for all of their lives will be moved away in order to allow a Canadian-Romanian company to install the largest gold extraction facility of Europe. The planned 800-hectare cyanide pool can be considered as of fearsome proportion especially in the light of the cyanide catastrophe of the year 2000 which left the Tisza river completely and utterly devastated.
