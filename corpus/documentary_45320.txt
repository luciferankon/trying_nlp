Perhaps the last surviving artist of the original Surrealist artist movement (as well as the famously former lover of Max Ernst) Leonora Carrington's life and work is arguably not 'surreal' at all nor is it classifiable in any sense of the word. Perhaps indebted to Surrealism Carrington is nonetheless possessed of unique personal visions born from a fantastical interior life one based in Celtic legend alchemy fairy tales Tibetan Buddhism Tarot Kabbala astrology Mexican healing traditions and other mystical practices. This portrait the first such documentary of her life and work in the United States covers Carrington's entire oeuvre and includes a fanciful dramatization of her 1939 short story 'The Debutante.'
