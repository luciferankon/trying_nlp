The third and last part of the trilogy where we see Moacir as a film director: the film and the scenes that Moacir conceives and shoots - scenes entertained tragic dramatic and romantic - with its particular cinematic and aesthetic style. On the other hand we see the behind the scenes of the construction of this film: a documentary that shows Moacir conducting his fictions in everyday familiar situations.
