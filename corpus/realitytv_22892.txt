A team of skilled and sometimes unskilled labourers designers and contractors go up against the clock to give a house a themed remodelling. Other than picking the theme the owners have no say in the design process. Hilarity ensues when builders clash problems arise and the five day time limit looms. Awesome designs create out of the ordinary houses that inspire and leave nothing to the imagination.
