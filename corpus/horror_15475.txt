Based on a true story that was claimed by writer Jay Anson The Amityville Horror is about a large house on the coast of Long Island where newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz and their three children move into the house that they hope will be their dream house which ends up in terror. Despite full disclosure by the real estate agent of the house's history George and Kathy buy the house. George says "Houses don't have memories" but they turn to their family priest Father Delaney who believes the house is haunted and performs an exorcism on the house. But the evil spirit in the house causes him to become blind and makes him very sick. With the help of another priest Father Bolen and a police detective George and Kathy face the fears of the house but not knowing the spirit is planning to possess George and then the children... For George and Kathy Lutz the Long Island colonial house on the river's edge seemed ideal: quaint spacious and amazingly affordable. Of course six brutal murders have taken place there just a year before but houses don't have memories... or do they? Soon their dream house becomes a hellish nightmare as walls begin to drip blood and satanic forces threaten to destroy them. Now after 28 days the Lutz family must attempt to escape from the demonic inhabitants... or forfeit their lives.
