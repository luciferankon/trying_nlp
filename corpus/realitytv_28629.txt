In the mid-western U.S. state of Minnesota most residents own a cabin - some of them on the water or buried deep in the woods. While some cabins are dilapidating after years of neglect others were poorly built to begin with. With so many cabins needing restoration work it can be a massive opportunity for builders. And in Prior Lake Minnesota brothers Chase and Brock Jurgensen are those opportunistic builders. Chase usually leads the projects and big brother Brock finds creative uses for reclaimed wood in each of those builds. Together the brothers are a 'dream team' that can transform any old lodge into a new functional and beautiful home in the wilderness.
