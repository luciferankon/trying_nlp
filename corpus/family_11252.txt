The Heart of Summer is a love story about a young college student Omari (Lex Kelly-Mead) who writes a book about an amazing summer experience after returning home to South Florida from school in Atlanta. Raised in a Christian home by Jamaican parents life in college had transformed Omari's identity from that of his family's upbringing. After returning home Omari visits church with his family where he had a brief encounter with a very beautiful young lady named Naomi Johnson (Tesh Beckham). Within days of meeting they both become inseparable and felt a natural bond that defied the norm of their very being one that they both never thought existed. But Naomi's over-protective father Mr. Johnson (played by veteran Jamaican actor Paul Campbell) would see to it that theirs would not be an easy ride. Mr. Johnson knows his daughter suffers from a hereditary condition and he doesn't want anything or anyone causing any kind of conflict in her life. There is reason to his madness. But conflict does find a way of getting into the mix by way of Omari's present girlfriend Jackie (Terry Ramirez) who decides to pay him a surprise visit down in hot and steamy Florida. Jackie's visit turns everything upside down and the drama gets turned up a few notches. Naomi and Omari are both trying to find their identities and their way through life....balancing the weights of family and what they know to be true love.
