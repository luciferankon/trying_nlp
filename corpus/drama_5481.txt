Mero a skilled shipyard worker is a single father. His son Lorenzo born from a relationship with an Albanian girl is his only reason for living. The father dreams that the boy will become a champion boxer to make up for his own anonymous career as an amateur in the ring. This is why he puts him through a tough training program teaching him day after day to throw punches and protect himself from life's low blows. The balance of this relationship is disturbed by the return of Lorenzo's mother Denisa and by the son's meeting with young Ana. Mero's trials are not over and he must face up to pain his prejudices and the remoteness of Italy's north east.
