After the end of a long relationship comedy writer Les Candalero (Joe Hursley; Accepted Resident Evil Extinction Fast & Furious) melts into self-doubt. He'll try anything to move on even a mail order elixir that makes you irresistibly funny. It works... too well which casts doubts on the one thing he's let define him - his sense of humor. With the help of his best friend Pops (Steve Lemme; Super Troopers Beerfest) Les sets out to flush this aphrodisiac from his system. Along the way surreality begins to blossom throughout his world and Les has to accept that his desperate need for approval was the real cause of this. Can he be funny and human at the same time? Can he be more? Is it too late for those questions? Does this hat look funny?
