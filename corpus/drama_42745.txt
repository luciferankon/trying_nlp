Based on a dramatic episode of Cambodia's History in the sixties. It was about a plot fomented from the outside and in the Angkor-Siemreap-Kompong Thom region by the CIA two South-East Asian governments tied to the "chariot" of Imperialism and General "Dap" Chhuon Mchulpich (the Governor and Commander of the Cambodian armed forces of the Angkor-Siemreap-Kompong Thom region) all of them being very dissatisfied with the "neutralist" and anti-imperialist policy of Prince Norodom Sihanouk Chief of State of the Kingdom of Cambodia and more particularly with the rejection by Sihanouk in 1963 of the conditional and humiliating U.S. aids.
