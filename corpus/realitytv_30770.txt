Setting vacant for nearly 40 years the Lawn Atlas Missile Base is part of Cold War history. Six Atlas F complexes were constructed in 1961 considered invulnerable to Russian ICBM attack. After deactivation in 1965 the missiles were removed and all the sites demilitarized. The 18 to 20 million dollar-sites were salvaged given to schools or sold in public auctions. No sites were held for preservation. The 185 deep silo is now filled with water. Many rumors exist as to what remains at the bottom. The site has been visited by explorers and vandals ever since it was declassified. Once you fall in there is now way out. Clover and Rachel set out to discover what's at the bottom by sending an underwater camera to the floor of the silo. The Lawn Atlas Missile Base represents the best and the most frightening aspects of American military history.
