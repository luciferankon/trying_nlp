Martin Spang Olsen has come with an offer to the Government and the students of class 7.v. Suspend the regular curriculum and the ridged style of teaching that enforces it in favor of a groundbreaking and controversial new educational concept; The senses. According to Martin Spang Olsen suppressed emotions are the only obstacle for humans in achieving optimal power. His provocative claim is that the first six years of school should consist solely of the education of the senses based on his theories of "Song Dance and Fight". His curriculum? Challenge students to look inside themselves. To feel silence explore uncertainty and above all find understanding in their emotions and with it peace. It's this journey alone that will lead them to their inner power and untapped unlimited potential. His promise? higher intelligence accumulating in a student's ability to learn the entire primary school curriculum in just two years. His hope? To change the way human beings interact with the world by guiding a new generation on child at a time. No school has dared to implement his theory in full practice - until now.
