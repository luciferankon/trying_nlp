Keith and Kim Lussier are a childless couple who are given custody of a 3-month-old foster child Brittany. However tragedy strikes when Kim dies of cancer in the middle of the adoption process leaving Keith to fight for Brittany's custody alone. Keith Lussier and his wife Kim's dream comes true when they are selected to adopt a Korean girl they baptize Brittany. But Kim withheld information about her terminal cancer and dies soon after. The adoption agency now invokes clauses to have the baby re-assigned to an other couple. Born father Keith persists supported by his own father and in-laws against his mother's skepticism to have his paternal rights acknowledged in court.
