In Sept 2004 five ageing men took five ageing cycle-craft and chose to bike it from Edinburgh to York covering 80 miles a day to raise money for charity. With training consisting entirely of smoking cigarettes and drinking pints the ride was never going to be easy yet in five years of the annual ride the boys have made more than ≈Å30000 for good causes - with even actor Paul Newman making personal donations. Blood Sweat and Beers follows the group on their journey through the best and the worst of the British countryside. The result is a heart-warming tale of camaraderie with a Spinal Tap-esque flavour hindered by a truly incompetent film crew and a sardonic dwarf in the form of Graham Hughes (The Libertine Clash of the Titans).
