Sunderrajan aka Sura (Shiva) comes to Chennai from Coimbatore on his way to Saudi Arabia. He is received by Marthandam (S. P. B. Charan) a veterinary doctor who is going to marry his sister soon. After the travel agent informs Sura that he cannot taste liquor or women in Saudi he along with Marthandam go to a wine shop to have the last gulp. It's a dry day thanks to elections. Though disappointed Sura is determined to taste the 'quarter' and starts his journey to various places in Chennai where he is told that liquor would be available. He goes to a politico who supplies wine for votes a star hotel an Anglo-Indian group of youngsters a fish market a gambling den a kulfi shop and a brothel house among other places all in search of 'quarter'. During his trip he meets Saraswathi aka Saro (Lekha Washington) who attempts suicide after her parents scold her and King-Prince a father-son duo (both roles played by John Vijay) who run a gambling center. How Sura in the company of Marthandam and Saro succeeds in his mission and leaves for Saudi Arabia forms the remaining story.
