The St. Louis area has long been considered by fans and band members alike to be Gypsy's home away from home. O April 11th 2015 Gypsy returned to the historic Wildey Theatre in nearby Edwardsville IL to play two sold out electrifying shows. Presented here in 16:9 picture quality and sound is a rarely captured evening of one of the greatest original jam bands playing their hearts out in some of their best material. Layered vocal harmonies virtuoso instrumentation and a killer horn section shine on classics like "Dead And Gone" "Blind Man" "Gypsy Queen Pt. 1" "Tomorrow Is The Last To Be Heard" and much more.
