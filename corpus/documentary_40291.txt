Equipped with cameras a pushcart for his belongings and plenty of walking shoes - filmmaker Shane Nelson left his hometown on the Atlantic coast to walk over 3000 miles across America in search of his first feature film. Poignant and self-affirming 'Left' is a genre-bending documentary that incorporates diverse interviews and breathtaking montage sequences backed by an original soundtrack featuring live recordings from local artists and street musicians met along the way. Throughout his trip Nelson attempts to discover the answers to five questions - 1. What is happiness? 2. Do we communicate well as a society? 3. What is the importance of art and music? 4. What's the biggest solvable problem we are facing as a society? 5. Do you believe in a higher power? Forrest Gump was the personification of the experience of a generation whereas 'Left' is the soapbox upon which multiple generations voice their thoughts and concerns regarding the current day and age.
