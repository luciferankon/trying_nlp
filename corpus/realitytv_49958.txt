In each episode a dream team of handy men will come to the aid of one wife with a totally relatable problem: she's got a honey do list a mile long and her husband doesn't know where to begin. That's where our hunky carpenters come in. They'll bring their tools and talents and get to work doing all those things her man doesn't know how to do. They'll paint the dining room and finish the deck. They'll snake the toilet and swap the old can lights for a new chandelier. Oh and they'll also make the husband a part of their team so he knows how to do all those things after they're gone.
