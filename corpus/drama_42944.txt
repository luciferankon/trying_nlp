After her dementia diagnosis Loretta's only son Gary has essentially left her to live her life alone at Oakwood Retirement Home. After a few months Loretta has quickly realized that Oakwood isn't the retirement paradise the peppy ad and enticing brochure had promised; but rather a bleak and lifeless housing facility she's doomed to spend the last days of her life in. Making the most of her situation the strong willed and independent Loretta tries drawing semblance from her old life by caring for an Iris flower from the windowsill of her bedroom; the flower that will bring her the happiness she's been looking for.
