New Labour MP Jean Price is quickly learning how things work in Parliament with the help of her fellow MP whom she shares an office with and her run ins with an arrogant MP from the ruling Conservative party. Trying to arrange a share in order to get home in time for her husband's birthday dinner Jean becomes the arrogant man's "sweetheart" which means both of them can leave early since they would otherwise cancel each others votes out after a debate.
