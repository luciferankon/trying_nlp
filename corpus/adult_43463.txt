Four lengthy homosexual episodes of guys being sodomized by other guys strung together by narration from Derrick Vinyard. The first involves hot clubber Billy who only is a top picking up straight guy Mike. But Erik the bouncer and former Billy trick suggests to Mike making Billy the bottom for both of them. They do. Secondly Tyler invites Jake an Internet date over for sex. They both give it to each other although supposedly neither likes to receive. Thirdly Kevin the bartender tries to hook up with three different bar patrons one after another the same night. When they discover his ploy they give it to him in a sling presumably located downstairs in the bar. Finally the narrator gives his own account of submission to his closeted football boyfriend Jason.
