Lisa is dying and - since it's the last thing she can do for somebody else - wants to give one of her kidneys to someone who will eventually die if they aren't going to be transplanted. In the studio are three candidates who show clips of their lives tell their story and explain Lisa why they should be the one to receive the kidney. The audience at home can send text messages to help Lisa make this very difficult decision.
