Depicts the struggles of reservation-dwelling Native Americans in the North Central United States. The main character is an introspective and lovable person in a process of seeking pride and identity through traditional and mystical means of gathering power. His high school friend who is a Vietnam War Veteran is exerting power as a highly principled social activist using a modern rational materialist adversarial model of progress. Buddy Red Bow is struggling in the face of persecution by greedy developers and political in-fighting to keep his nation on a Montana Cheyenne Reservation financially solvent and independent. Philbert a simple-minded friend of Buddy's ardently pursues Native American/First Nation wisdom and lore wherever he can find it--even on Bonanza--in order to earn his warrior name. He's even got his war pony Protector: a beat-up old wreck of a car. Buddy's sister has been arrested in Santa Fe and together Buddy and Philbert set off on a road trip to look after her kids and go bail her out. However Bonnie's arrest has something strange about it as her friend Rabbit points out. As the miles roll by Philbert's faith challenges Buddy's hard-edged view of the world (and occasional bout of reckless violence) and together they face the realities and dreams of being Cheyenne in the modern-day US as they fight to free Bonnie and her children and elude the Feds.
