Over 60 minutes of McCoy's supercharged performance in front of 35000 adoring and festive fans was captured by eight state-of-the-art High Definition cameras and recorded in HD Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Among the 12 songs included are "The Boys Are Back In Town" "Wink" "The Shake" "No Doubt About It" "They're Playing Our Song" "You Gotta Love That" "Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On" and "The Hillbilly Rap" (during which country's original rap master makes the nail-biting ascent up the rafters and onto the stage's roof to lay down his rhythm-and-rhyme rumination.) Neal McCoy LIVE! also includes a backstage pass with exclusive behind the scenes footage at the annual festival set deep in the North Wisconsin woods. Bonus features include McCoy clowning around with fans; interviews with General Tommy Franks comedic actor Rob Schneider and TV's "Jungle" Jack Hanna; a look at McCoy's humanitarian efforts; and much more.
