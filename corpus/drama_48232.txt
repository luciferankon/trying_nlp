An elderly woman alone in her crumbling house and ensconced in the difficult circumstances of her life is nevertheless stoic. She is about to have her world upended when a young fugitive enters her property seeking a place of solace. Strange and silent though the young man is a tentative friendship is formed. They have both been rocked by seismic events she by the military testing that has irreparably damaged her house and he by the wars he has escaped. But the comfort and exhilaration of a shared daily life is underlined by fear - she doesn't really know who this man is and he doesn't know if he can trust her and stop running.
