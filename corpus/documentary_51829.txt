Since 2000 the conventual friars minor have been present in Havana and in Cuba where they follow the Order's evangelic message and are intensely involved in social activities. Pope Francis' Encyclical letter Laudato Si' was released in May 2015. It is inspired by the message of Saint Francis of Assisi and represents an important source of inspiration for this movie.
