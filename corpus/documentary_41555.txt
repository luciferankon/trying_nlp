Bob Chipman hosts this series in which he examines classic movies to explore if they can still be considered that distinguished in the present day. To that end Chipman endeavors to look at not only their artistic qualities but also of the times in which they were created and how the movies in question reflected them. In doing so Chipman is able to take a larger picture of these films' cultural significance and see what they can still mean today.
