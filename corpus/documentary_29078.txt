In 2004 Sean Willmore traveled across six continents and nineteen countries interviewing and filming the lives and stories of park rangers in an attempt to explore the social and environmental pressures on the front line of conservation. Sean Willmore a Park Ranger from Warringine Park in Victoria Australia sold his car and remortgaged his house 3 times to make this film. Sean spent most of 2004 filming the lives and stories of rangers on 6 continents and 19 countries. There were some incredible experiences: volcanoes ascents by horseback in Chile and Argentina a charging elephant in South Africa drowning rivers in Costa Rica Mountain Gorilla protection in volatile Virungas of Uganda helicopter rescues in the Rockies dangerous anti-poaching patrols and chases in South Africa Galapagos Uganda and India and violent threats by rebel soldiers antagonistic poaching communities and protesting fisherman. Sean counts himself lucky to be alive. These experiences set the tone for the life stories and challenges facing the professional Park Ranger. This documentary moves away from the cute cuddly or dangerous animals seen in traditional wildlife documentaries. The animals themselves become the backdrop for the human face of conservation. The aim of the film is to expose 'The Thin Green Line' in the hope that others will join Park Rangers to save what is endangered.
