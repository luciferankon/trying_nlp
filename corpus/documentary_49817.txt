Turgut Tekdemir is a music teacher in a religious vocational school in North of Turkey. Mr. Turgut have a project called 'Bir Ses Bir Nefes' (One Sound One Breath). Within this project Mr. Turgut choosing talented student and some song from different cultures in Turkey and practice with student for months. Then the choir giving a concert. The point of the project is call attention to the importance of being together without looking each other's nation language culture etc. The easiest way to say call attention to this point is make student ready to give a great concert. Some of people in Turkey think that singing is a sin. That point of view and the 'fear of the other cultures' together make Mr. Turgut's job even harder.
