Her four eldest brothers Chen Chi ('Ken Zhu' (qv)) Chen Cheng ('Chun-Tian Lan' (qv)) Chen Chuan ('Sphinx Ting' (qv)) and Chen He ('Godfrey Gao' (qv)) attempt to smother any chance she has at a love life by setting impossible rules with respect to suitable men. One rainy day Tao-Hua encounters Shih Lang ('Jiro Wang' (qv)) and immediately falls for him. Despite Shih Lang's above-average academic standards and high-quality character Tao-Hua's brothers only tighten their grip. To add to her woes she must also compete with Kung Hui-Chi ('Chia-ying Lee' (qv)) for Shih Lang's affection. Will Tao-Hua win her independence and the heart of Shih Lang?
