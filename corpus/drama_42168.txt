Echoes of Dostoyevsky. At the start Christine Blanc is a temp her boyfriend has gone. Near the story's end she's been offered a steady job she has a fianc√© other men seem interested in her she's passed her driving test and after she wins 1000 Euros in a scratch-off her colleagues sing that she's a jolly good fellow ("one of us"). But something's askew: her gaze is too direct her eyes open too widely; conversational gambits hit odd notes; she parrots others' words; she cooks too much food when she invites a supervisor to dinner. When the supervisor takes Christine on a spontaneous outing that disorients her her oddities become something else. Can things ever be normal?
