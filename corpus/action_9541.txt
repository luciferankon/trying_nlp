Johannes (50) is an Icelandic Buy-king and CEO of an hedge fund under investigation by the specially appointed Icelandic prosecutor. He is believed to have illegal funds in off shore bank accounts. His reputation in Iceland is not good. The nation is angry and blames him and others like him for the economic crash in the country. As an act of reconciliation although misguided Johannes bids on and purchases the most important archaeological find in Scandinavia in recent times. A spearhead made from Damascus steel found in a cove in the north of Sweden. Outbidding the competition Johannes tells the media that he will offer the spearhead as a gift to the nation in an effort to remind them of their proud Viking roots. Laufey (28) his daughter and business partner is opposed to the idea but has to go along with it. What Johannes doesn't realize is that the spearhead is cursed. It amplifies violence and lust for power. Even in the most innocent people. Johannes heads home to Iceland in a jet with Laufey his daughter Elva his wife and Johannes Jr. his overweight teenage son. When they land in Iceland they head to Thingvellir where the family has a country estate. The plan is to gather the government and the president in a ceremony to hand over the precious gift of the spear. But when Johannes and his family arrive at the country estate they are taken hostage by masked men who have their sights set on the off shore accounts that aren't supposed to exist. Due to the spearhead a manageable hostage situation turns bloody and no one gets out alive.
