In the middle of a parsley field there is a tiny stadium where a team of hardworking snails are training for the next Snailympics Games. Snails are slow soft fragile creatures and this makes them good-natured. They inspire warmth and affection. In spite of their physical limitations our protagonists are highly devoted fighters with a winning spirit. Therein resides their humour: these seemingly weak little animals are capable of throwing the javelin playing basketball and even diving thanks to their spirit of improvement.
