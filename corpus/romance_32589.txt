A sixteen year old teenager made an immortal warrior must decide the Fate of the other immortals. Norse Gods grant Carla the status of immortality. She must fight against all odds to survive when the man responsible for her becoming a Demi-Goddess betrays her. Her connection to her Viking heritage is growing and she is becoming a threat to his plan. She is protected by another he can't face. His plan is failing and Mark is becoming frantic. He must stop her from leaving the Islands or he will be set to lose the thing he cherishes the most. Carla is the key to unlocking more than just the cure for immortality. She will also gain access to the Norse God's themselves and endless power. A power that he must possess. Time is running. Sides must be chosen.
