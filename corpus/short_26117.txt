Aspiring novelist Kyôko is in the process of writing her first novel while packing to move in with her lesbian girlfriend Rie. Kyôko seems uncertain about the move but much like she is having problems with her writing she is unable to articulate the underlying issues for what she is feeling. As Kyôko describes the plot outline of her novel to Rie the story which sounds semi-autobiographical Rie understands Kyôko's apprehensions better than Kyôko herself.
