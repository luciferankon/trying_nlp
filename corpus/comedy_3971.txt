From the creative team behind "The Burg" and "The All-For-Nots" comes "All's Faire" - the original Renaissance Faire comedy. "If the real world be too much for you to bear... then come on down to the twentieth annual Southeastern Delaware Renaissance Faire!" So goes the commercial. But for the lords ladies wenches and minstrels who call the shire home nothing could be more important than their private realm of fantasy. So when an outside interest threatens to shut the faire down they will defend it to the death.
