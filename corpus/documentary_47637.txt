The documentary examines Truffaut's life and career in astonishing totality highlighting selected clips from many of his best and most-loved films including under-appreciated gems like his crackerjack movie-within-a-movie "Day for Night" and his tender and insightful portrait of married ennui "Bed and Board." The layer of Truffaut's generally affable public persona is also peeled back a bit revealing the complicated often moody artist who existed beneath the veneer. Many seasoned Truffaut buffs may very well be familiar with a lot of this stuff - particularly the bits about the director's famously tumultuous childhood which served as an inspiration of sorts for "The 400 Blows" - but it's still an engaging and genuinely probing look at one of the most significant cinematic storytellers in the history of the medium.
