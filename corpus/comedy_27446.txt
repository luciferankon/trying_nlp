In the market place tent the writer Jaroslav Hasek shows four different films. The representatives of the separate stories are part of the public. 1) Vzorná skola mocnárství: The first former Chocholka ('Vladimír Pucholt' (qv)) is frightened by the Latin composition. He runs into the toilet and refuses to leave it despite the insistence of his classmates teacher and the headmaster. 2) Vzorné rodinné stestí: The first former Honzátko ('Václav Postránecký' (qv)) buys a hamster. The animal settles inside the upholstered couch and doesn't want to come out. The family asks the animal trader Bukl to help. 3) Vzorný mecenás: The industrialist Kauble ('Bohus Záhorský' (qv)) unwillingly becomes the recipient of numerous applications for financial help. 4) Vzorná láska lepsích lidí: The old bachelor Hanzlícek ('Josef Kemr' (qv)) is pursued by his landlady who wants to marry him to her daughter Anna.
