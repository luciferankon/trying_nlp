Spencer Wellington a wealthy young man who is threatened with paresis will not take his physician's warning and marries Grace Valient. Dr. Rand loves the same woman but his professional honor will not permit him to tell her the secret about her husband. A child is born a hopeless defective that dies almost immediately. The mother loses her mind for a time and another child is substituted for the dead baby. In the meantime the husband keeps getting worse. Realizing that he cannot hold off the moment of his mental breakdown much longer Wellington starts in on a fast round of debauchery. He keeps a number of dancing girls in a secret retreat on his estate and one night falls dead in tin- middle of a wild carouse. Indications point to the union of Doctor Rand and the widow.
