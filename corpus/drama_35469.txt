The life of a flight attendant is glamorous and exciting but as The Aviary follows Summer Pozzi from city to city we discover that when the uniform comes off things can get very complicated. An unexpected transfer takes Summer from Chicago her boyfriend and her mother to a crowded San Francisco apartment. Her new roommates include Portia (who is in the throws of an identity crisis) Kate (who has an old score to settle with Summer) and Lucas (who Summer hastily finds affection with but discovers he's not what he appears to be). In this new city Summer watches the carefully designed blueprint of her future begin to slip out of reach. Finally Summer falls into the arms of the Captain of her dreams. Everything seems back on track until a disturbing visit from Summer's past forces her to choose between true love and the man she has been searching for all her life.
