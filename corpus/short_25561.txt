sanscesse is a dance film that is pure choreography for camera. It is inspired by the nature of visual perception and how the mind reconstructs the images it perceives (via form orientation depth motion and colour). It can also be seen as a reading of the emergence of human kind and its journey towards eternal life. The film mirrors the ceaseless movement of stars the continuous nature of the evolutionary process the incessant flow of life into afterlife and the coalescence of history that unites us to our origins.
