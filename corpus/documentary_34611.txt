Mexico is a country with a great cinematographic history and although throughout its history it has had moments of both great splendor and crisis it is a spectacle which forms a part of the everyday life of the majority of the population. At the beginning of the new millennium Mexicans' cinematographic language began to change just as new forms of production were developed and systems of promotion and distribution were modernized. In the last few years despite the competition of foreign film industries millions of people have attended movie theaters to see Mexican films.
