Floor by floor the visitor can discover small self-contained worlds: grousers collectors the forgotten people with obsessions concealed and exposed passions. Behind securely locked doors each prepares his own heady brew. Then however death makes its entrance for the first time sweeping through the stairwell. The owner of the house a resident himself dies. His nephew an entrepreneur inherits the building and acts immediately. He moves out takes up lodgings hands out notice to quit renovates and devastates. One goal hovers before his eyes; to get rid of the tenants and make money out of the property.

What comes to light thereby is an anthill full of life and once it opens up a flood of comical individuals streams out of it all fighting for their own living space. A minor official plagued by persecution mania fears a dreadful end to the matter. Though the signs he sees of this are all wrong nevertheless in a furious finale the outside world descends upon the house and his inhabitants.
