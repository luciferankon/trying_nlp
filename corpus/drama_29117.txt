A couple of young university students decide to spend the day in Toledo in order to forget a little of the routine in which they are. At nine o'clock in the morning Jos√© Luis waits at the Atocha station for his girlfriend Mari Carmen. The couple has deceived their families who have told that they will eat in the Faculty. The journey is eternal and the stay in the city rather than surprise them as they expected immerses them even more in the monotony in which they live. Without friends without relatives and without university partners the couple will spend twelve hours in Toledo half a day of tenderness in the rain and the December sun that will help them to know themselves better.
