A group of students from the fifth year of an Italian high school tell about their last school year guiding us through school times and spaces in the very delicate moment of the passage to adulthood and to the world of work caught between the anxiety for the imminent final exams and the uncertain expectations towards their future. Their school experience is mirrored in some former students' narrative 30-year-old men and women remembering their school education and comparing it to their work experience and more generally to their current life. From students and ex students' words a world of sharing and perseverance comes to light a world reminding us that the "student condition" is common to everyone and it's repeating in time: can listening to yesterday's and today's students help to improve tomorrow's school?
