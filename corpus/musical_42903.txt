Two friends both named Willie are working as window-cleaners at the American Embassy. They rescue a girl from a roof-top after witnessing a scene as she tries to gain an audience with a film producer whom she is certain will take her to Hollywood. The two young men offer their penniless protégée shelter in their own impecunious colony made up of old railway carriages. All is very happy until their friendship is threatened by growing rivalry over her affections.
