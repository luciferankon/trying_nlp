The story is a meditative depiction of Bruno Mathsson's townhouse at the glass mill in Kosta. Like Mathsson's private house in Södrakull and Frösakull the townhouses had been neglected for a long time when the two artists started working. The film is no documentary but adheres to the visual and formal qualities of the buildings. Artist Carsten Nicolais soundtrack reinforces the abstract conceptual character of the film.
