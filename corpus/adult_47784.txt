Dear Diary This morning the pictures came back from my summer vacation in Hawaii. Dawn and I spent the day putting them in my photo album and remembering all the wonderful times and the fabulous men we met while we were there; the days on the beach making love the tropical nights in quiet motel rooms the motor scooter trip up to the cane fields where we all got crazy and that unbelievable party aboard the yacht that turned into a non-stop orgy....but then I'll tell you all about this and more in my Hawaiian scrapbook.
