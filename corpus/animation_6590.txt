Welcome to the animal underworld. Flea-ridden black cats pretending to bring bad luck for a profit senile pigeons who've lost the knack of flying laboratory rats with after-effects and cockroaches determined to make a name for themselves playing the maracas. And things are even worse when the animals come from other countries. Tano (a stray cat) Chung-I Fly (an oriental pigeon) Paulov (an Eastern European rat) and Ram√≥n (a Caribbean cockroach) are all part of this "dispossessed" fauna whose most prized possessions are their dreams.
