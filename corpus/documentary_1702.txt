Every four years participants from 27 island nations gather to celebrate their culture and to perform their identity at the Festival of Pacific Arts. In 2016 FestPAC took place in Guam the largest of the Mariana Islands and as many say one of the USA's last colonies. One of the festivals core themes in 2016 was: 'Our resources from land and sea that have sustained Pacific islanders for thousands of years'. We meet festival delegates from three island nations (Tokelau Guam and Kiribati) to discuss how they perceive today's environmental challenges: We are looking for the undercurrents of a changing climate. How does climate change discourse affect performances of traditional and contemporary dance and other art forms? Our interview partners are: Asi Fangalua Halaleva-Pasilio (one of the leading figures of the delegation from Nukunonu Tokelau) Kaure Babo (a newly elected member of parliament from Kiribati) Joe Viloria (a cultural practitioner and fisherman from Guam who is working relentlessly to restore a perceived ancient Chamorro culture) and Adrienne L. Kaeppler (curator of Oceanic Ethnology at the Smithsonian Institution Washington D.C.). A film by Dennis Dellschow and Eric Petzoldt - 35 minutes - 2017
