Billy Brown is a forty something record promotion man ('plugger') at VTO Records - a medium sized mostly unsuccessful label. He hates his job because he hates the mediocre rubbish he has to promote. His nemesis is tone-deaf A and R man Jamie who's aim in life is to sack Billy. Will Billy win his battle with Jamie?
