Jeremy Selenfriend is an Emmy Award nominated Special FX Makeup Artist who built his business Monster In My Closet from the ground up. Normally switching up genres for any artist is a huge obstacle but Jeremy is doing it with great ease. He began working on super-campy indie horror films like MOLD! which is a throwback to the classic science-fiction movies of the 1950s and went onto other horror films like "Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet" "The Bleeding House" and "Crazy Eights." His most recent credits include the second season of HBO's "Boardwalk Empire" and the Robert De Niro executively produced series "The 2-2" premiering on CBS.
