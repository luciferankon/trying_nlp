In the South Bohemian little town young Lenka ('Lenka Machoninová' (qv)) prepares for her meeting with Pavel ('Ivan Vyskocil (II)' (qv)) who is visiting her from Prague. She invites her girlfriend Markéta ('Miluse Voborníková' (qv)) to accompany her to the date. Pavel is not alone either - his friend Honza ('Viktor Sodoma' (qv)) arrived with him on a scooter. The young people walk through the forest and have a bath in the small forest lake. As the day goes it becomes gradually clear that both the boys are interested in the more attractive Markéta.
