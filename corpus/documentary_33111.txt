Winner of four Emmy(R) Awards including Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming (Jon Alpert Matthew O'Neill)! The 86th Combat Support Hospital (CSH)--the U.S. Army's premier medical facility in Iraq and formerly one of Saddam Hussein's elite hospitals--is the setting for this unforgettable documentary that puts a human face on the war's cold casualty statistics. Directed by Emmy(R)-winner Jon Alpert (HBO's 'One Year in a Life of Crime') the film profiles the doctors and nurses at the 86th who fight to save wounded soldiers who are Medevaced (helicoptered) in on a numbingly routine basis. In addition to capturing the drama of victims and caregivers in the ER the film provides vivid frontline rescue footage with the 54th Medical Company Air Ambulance Team along with tension-filled scenes of soldiers patrolling what is considered the most dangerous road in the world: the five-mile highway from the Baghdad Airport to the CSH. It shows the Iraq war from the perspective of a military hospital in Baghdad. It has some relatively disturbing scenes in it therefore the U.S. Army is officially warning that military personnel watching it could experience symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.
