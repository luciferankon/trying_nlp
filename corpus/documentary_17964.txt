Byron Chief-Moon is a multi-talented actor stuntman dancer choreographer playwright founder of the Coyote Arts Percussive Performance Association and member of the Blackfoot Confederacy member of the Blood Band. Through his art and his life Chief-Moon's story is one of cultural survival. Themes of his dance creations begin with his people's traditional stories his attachment with the land and his community as well as the inner conflict he faces in existing within the Aboriginal culture and the wider community. He is ensuring the preservation of his native language through its incorporation in his work. As well he's firm in his resolve that the spoken legends of his people are communicated to the next generations in his society and for the larger society too. His art and his life cross boundaries. Challenging the cultural construct is never easy but Chief-Moon does.
