Oliver Platt plays Wallace Benton a journalist for a New York tabloid magazine called the NY Ledger. He works along side his soon to be ex-wife and various other people using his journalistic instincts to get the story no matter what it takes. He seems to drink heavily and he curses so he's clearly an average guy with no super human qualities about him. On the side he teaches a class full of journalism students who sometimes go along on his researching "missions" and he frequently uses them to get information on stories he has done or is doing to save himself some time. Benton is a smooth talker with a lot of tricks up his sleeve always searching for more information to add just the right touch to his articles and he sometimes finds himself using somewhat devious tactics to get that information.
