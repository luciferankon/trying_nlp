In 1992 my neighbor and close family friend Julie D'Agostino was born with Cystic Fibrosis a potentially life-threatening genetic disease. In and out of hospitals since she was a child things took a turn for the worse right before Julie's 19th birthday. This documentary chronicles Julie and her family's life-long battle with the disease leading up to the recent life-saving double lung transplant surgery. It also documents our neighborhood's strength as well as the support from the entire community. As a filmmaker I felt a responsibility to tell Julie's courageous story and shed light on the importance of organ donation.
