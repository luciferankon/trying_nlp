TETHERED is an independent film in the purest form. We follow Peter who's life is turned upside-down when he takes the fall for his friends and is placed under house arrest. As he struggles to cope with his new restraints figuratively and literally he quickly realizes that there is much more going on than what lies on the surface. This directorial debut of Chris Foster introduces the likes of Nathan Bonk Alexandra Pica Brian Ballance Daniel Cancio and many more.
