All you will see is new  only the natural preserves almost unchanged its appearance . All that is generated by man has no more than a hundred years . 38 Parallel NORTH is a coordinated part  an undefined place on the 38th parallel north . It could be the border between North and South Korea  the scene of major conflicts in the post-war or Smyrna  the threshold of Turkey . It could be Athens . It could be San Francisco . The Strait of Messina is the protagonist . An invisible border of this parallel . Here nature has thrown at the man violently and catastrophic time it bears the signs . Messina  Sicily's port  rests his feet on a natural boundary  reminiscent to those who live there  that man is but a cell in the Earth system . The fracture  the wound that separates Sicily from mainland is pulsating  alive and rotting . The time for men to Messina sounds like a countdown .
