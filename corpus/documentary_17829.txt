New residents in Memphis Tenn. Dr's. Sylvia and Steve Richey are ready to renovate the family room in their English-style home. The couple would like to update the dark room so they can use it for relaxing entertaining and holiday gatherings. They hope the design experts will make this the grand southern room it should be. After considering the three proposed design plans the couple chooses Jackie Glisson. Mr. Glisson brings the room together with an eclectic appeal blending contemporary and traditional with the use of sumptuous fabrics and textures. Form meets function and the Richey's room looks as though it were pulled together over time.
