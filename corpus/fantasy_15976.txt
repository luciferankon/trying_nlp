A young man (Art Hindle) suffers a lightning strike on a dark and stormy night. Instead of dying he absorbs the lightning's electrical energy into his body losing consciousness. He awakens in a hospital only to learn that the accident changed both his body and his life as he knew it forever. Now he can discharge electricity from his body at will. The government coerces the young man into becoming an operative and his handler gives him a wristwatch that is not really a wristwatch but rather is a device that allows him to control precisely his electrical discharges. The hook is that now that the lightning strike "charged" his body he has no choice but to re-charge the electrical energy stored in his body on a regular basis or he will die.
