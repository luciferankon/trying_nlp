Set in the distant future of 1986 our story follows THE IMMORAL DR. DICQER as he makes a go of it in suburbia. A former single man and pirate turned family man and back-alley gynecologist Dr. Dicqer wants nothing more than to be left alone in his new life. So maybe it was a bad idea to steal a ship from a crew of bloodthirsty mercenaries and make off with the bride of a powerful sorcerer bent on revenge. High adventure comes to the 'burbs and the doctor's going to get what's coming to him.
