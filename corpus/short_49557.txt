A couple in Moyobamba Peru struggle to maintain a reserve for an endangered species of monkey. During the course of an especially trying month they focus their efforts on the survival of two infant monkeys (Yumi and Tumai) both rescued from illegal captivity. Highlighted by the energetic music of Sonido Verde de Moyobamba (Green Sound of Moyobamba) and against the backdrop of a group of orphan monkeys being readied for a return to the wild "Yumi Means Rain" is set in the little-known towns and native communities of Northern Peru's disappearing cloud forests.
