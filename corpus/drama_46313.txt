Teresa is overwhelmed: with a husband three young sons a job as a crew leader in a textile factory and volunteer commitments as cultural leader of her union. Her husband Ram√≥n wants more of her attention; her feelings are mixed wanting domestic peace feeling responsibilities to the revolution and wanting to control her own life beyond doing dirty dishes. They separate; he begins an affair. When he wants a reconciliation she asks what his response would be if she'd had an affair too. "But men are different" is his reply. He's failed her test and to hold on to independence and self-respect she remains uncompromising and hard-edged.
