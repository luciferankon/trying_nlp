The film 'L'Autre' or 'The Other' follows the movement of two girls within the space of postmodern architecture in a closed time loop. Un the girl in a white dress represents the the conscious the archetypal light and other philosophical concepts of Apollonian nature. Deux the girl in a black dress represents her opposite: the archetypal darkness the subconscious unintegrated Jungian shadow and other Dionysian philosophical concepts. The meeting and reconciliation of these opposites is enacted in the meeting of Un and Deux followed by separation at the start of a new cycle.
