Film crew on the road: Director ('Jaroslav Plesl' (qv)) his Producer ('Simona Babcáková' (qv)) and their Director of Photography ('Jirí Vyorálek' (qv)) and Sound Arist ('Johana Svarcova' (qv)).

Their next collaborative effort - the Director's lifetime dream - is quickly becoming oblivion because he failed to win a grant which means it won't be made. And so the frustrated Director and his colleagues await their chance among record-holders of curious disciplines such as crawling with a squash racket or collecting four-leaf clovers. How will the collision of these two worlds end? What will the Director's next film be about?
