In the early 90's Italian businessman Romano Artioli committed to revive the legendary Bugatti Automobile brand to create the most prestigious and technological supercar of those days. He summoned an exceptional team of engineers and technicians conceiving a new futuristic factory in Campogalliano near Modena the heart of the Italian 'Motor Valley'. His venture starts auspiciously and the new car named EB 110 in honor of Ettore Bugatti the founder of the brand is unveiled with great fanfare in Paris during September 1992. Over 200 technicians were employed in the factory excited and proud for this pioneering enterprise unmatched in the history of motoring. While many showings of the car are promoted all around the world Artioli's wide creativity ranges across the board from design and fashion branding to partnerships with the best manufacturers/suppliers of the time (Michelin BBS Aerospaciale Nakamici ...). But shortly after the presentation of the second car prototype EB 112 - a four-door sedan designed by well renown Giugiaro - a car aimed to consecrate Bugatti as top excellence brand a number of questionable events quickly lead the company to bankruptcy all the way to liquidation of the business factory and its employees. After 25 years the factory is still there intact and sleepy as the day after its closure. It can be admired from the highway as a symbol of courage utopia and passion of its people. Employees still enchanted by the short but intense experience will share with us the feelings and atmospheres of a golden age dissolved too quickly. Thanks to valuable archive footage (pictures and video) and exclusive interviews we have the privilege to revive this mysterious and epic adventure which still fascinates us for its working ideals in terms of excellence enthusiasm and passion.
