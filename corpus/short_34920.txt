Post 9/11 dark and disturbing Because I Can touches on a number of issues whist portraying a kafka-esque vision of a never-ending cycle of violence in which the perpetrators are as much the victims as the detainees. Set in a desolate prison cell the action seems timeless- and the resulting anonymity of both the characters and their surrounding makes the events all the more horrific.
