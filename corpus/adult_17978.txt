The countess (Dominique St. Claire) is transfixed by the sight of a young woman making love to a horse in her stable. She later recalls this memorable sequence while making love to the count (Gabriel Pontello) in various orgies with their friends or when she & the count make love to their servants. After the count dies she returns to the stable and imagines that he has been reincarnated as the stallion.
