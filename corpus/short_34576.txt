The correct and full name of this short is "Screen Snapshots: LagunaU.S.A." (Columbia production number 9852) in which director/producer Ralph Staub is out touring Laguna Beach. While there he drops in at the Griffin Theatre where actors Brian Aherne Lon Chaney Jr. Dane Clark and Eddie Bracken are rehearsing as members of the Griffin Theatre Players their roles in an upcoming stage presentation of "Of Mice and Men." To be precise Lon Chaney is not in this film as "Lennie" as some sources seem to think. He is in this film as himself an actor rehearsing the role of "Lennie" (which he played in the 1939 film) for a stage production of "Of Mice and Men." That makes a slight difference in identifying his role in this short. The Griffin Theatre Players was an orginization of (mainly) film players who liked to get back "to their roots" and "on the boards" once in a while.
