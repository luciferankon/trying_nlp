A seventeen year old girl lives by herself in a luminous attic bedroom. Her father watches over her from a little town a few miles away where he lives on his own. Its summertime and very very hot. The bright clear light of Apulia accompanies this young woman in her summer holiday. Some relief comes from frequent showers. She often stands at the window her hair dripping wet and watches out as she did when she was a child and enjoyed looking out of windows or lerning out of balcony rails. She loves her eyes for what they can get but about all for what they can give to her dear ones or to the people she comes across like the disables old man who accepts her cares and company. In the evening to earn some pocket money she works as a waitres in a little pub where she meets a photographer who enables her to remember her mother who has recently dead and stimulates her love for photography. That's why some photos are suddenly inserted in the film as a link between the girl's personal experience and the historical context of the last troubled decades. The girl in spite of her young age has well realized the importance of observation and caught the precariousnes and instability of times. A september afternoon. The girl is going to see her father. She knocks at the door but nobody opens. She takes the key from her bag and walks in.
