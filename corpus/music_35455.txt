Filmed in front of a live audience in New York City earlier in 2014 Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga perform 60 minutes of jazz standards including It Don't Mean a Thing Sophisticated Lady Let's Face the Music and Dance Anything Goes and Cheek to Cheek. Backed by a 39-piece orchestra this glamorous showcase art-directed and lit by theatre genius Robert Wilson marries the vocal talents of a legendary crooner with a global pop star. The result is a nostalgic treat with a modern twist.
