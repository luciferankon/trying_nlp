Filmed while conducting a scientific research expedition in the expansive outback of Australia BUNYIP THE MOVIE is engulfed in both prevailing political debate and historic legend. Funded by a government grant Dr. Nick Jenson and Bunyip enthusiast Lindsay Farland search the continent far and wide for the elusive and possibly dangerous creature. Trailing them with camera in hand is a rather eccentric and not always reliable assistant who has been generously bestowed upon the team by the Australian Minister for Environment. Their journeys take them from the wild forests of Tasmania to the magnificent Ningaloo Reef of Western Australia and what they discover may be more than they ever bargained for. Dr. Jenson and his team's efforts to finally prove the existence of the mythical Bunyip is a twisted tale filled with beauty tragedy and adventure.
