Jessica's extraordinarily strong will and heart enables her to rebel against her fanatical cult-like upbringing. From seven to seventeen Jess is brainwashed to be one of the 'saved' to devote her life to Jesus to follow the discriminatory teachings of Pastor Finch and his understanding of Revelations. As her warm personality dictates she succeeds in fitting into this regime and spreads the word of Jesus in a fairly content manner. But when her friendship with Melanie develops into something a little more 'unnatural' she easily realizes the error of the Pastors teachings. The girls are subjected to terrible treatment to convince them to repent.
