In the summer of 2000 the owners of the "Ramon Sewing Workshop" in Mitzpeh Ramon announced their decision to close down the workshop. The 57 employees all workweary women refused to accept this "death sentence" and embarked on a heroic campaign to protect their income. For five weeks 57 jobless seamstresses entrenched themselves and their children inside the plant refusing to part from their sewing machines and determined to go the whole mile. Even the women themselves were surprised by the results when the workshop reopened as an independent cooperative owned and ran by the seamstresses themselves. Overnight they unexpectedly became Israel's working class heroes.
