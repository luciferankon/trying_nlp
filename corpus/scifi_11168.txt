The year is 2030 and planet Earth has begun a transformation as alien species from all over our galaxy begin to migrate to our little marble orbiting the Sun. Of course none of this is public and the migration is managed by a secret government agency called AIM; Alien Integration & Management. The series story arc follows the sometimes bungling adventures of AGENT9 as he bewilderingly finds himself working as an AIM agent. His past is a foggy blur and he struggles with his memory as he falls into a secret mission to find a mysterious "instrument" that may eventually be the clue to his own identity.
