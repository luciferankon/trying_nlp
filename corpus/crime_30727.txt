Based on the true story and award winning autobiography by Dean Dimitrieski Tears for My City tells the story of an immigrant white kid from Macedonia who moves to the most dangerous neighborhood in Detroit at the height of gang violence in the 1970s. With a crack house next door and gangs like Young Boys Incorporated fighting for control of the neighborhood Dean Dimitrieski struggles to keep himself and his family safe while refusing to join a gang -- even when most of his friends are already on the inside. He later befriends two of Detroit's most wanted drug lords and just when he feels he's starting to fit in he becomes a witness to a horrific crime that shatters his American dream and the life he loved in Detroit.
