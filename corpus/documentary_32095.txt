Assault on America gives both a personal and historical perspective to one of America's closest brushes with World War II. Following the United States' entrance into the war after the bombing of Pearl Harbor the German Navy launched submarines to attack and destroy the wartime shipping operation off the East Coast. The Germans anticipated the U.S. lack of preparedness for their assault and capitalized using just a handful of U-boats to sink more Allied tonnage off the East Coast than the entire Japanese Navy could claim in the Pacific. This is a story of devastation fear and survival. And remarkably this is a story still relatively unknown to many. The frightening and amazing details of this story are told by those who lived it The seamen who survived the U-boat sinking of their merchant ship relate the chaos of escaping a burning ship. A German U-boat radio operator tells of the life and death existence aboard his ship and his crew's experience upon being attacked and sunk by the U.S. Coast Guard. People who were children at the time of these assaults recall seeing the ocean on fire the prescribed blackouts coastal residents ignored and the debris that washed ashore following the attacks. The viewer will visit the remains of some of these ships as they sit on the bottom of the ocean and journey back in time to a pivotal point in World War II.
