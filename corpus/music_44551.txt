St. Johns Newfoundland is a city with a deep musical spirit and few bands embody that spirit better that The Once. Named for a unique Newfoundland phrase that means "imminently" now is indeed their time. Live at the Stagehouse is an hour of interviews and performances by this amazing trio featuring songs recorded live off the floor in late 2013 at the picturesque Stagehouse Recording Studio in St. Philip's. The Once embraces a different vision of Newfoundland music. Their sounds do not come from the noisy pubs and dockside taverns that fuel so much of the Island's energy. Instead their music comes from a quieter and more thoughtful place. Hope and tragedy are intertwined whether they are singing an old lament from World War I original songs that speak of love defeated or tasteful songs from the artists whose music inspires them. The Once: Live at the Stagehouse features some of their best-loved tunes and some never heard before. It is a unique opportunity to see one of Canada's fastest rising bands in the place that inspires them and feeds their soul.
