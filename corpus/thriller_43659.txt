Trevor Grainger Amber Croft and Rob Rankus are three like average dudes who run Go Time Liquidators - an eBay auction business. Trevor likes Stephen King Amber wants to be a singer-songwriter and Rob's into the Chili Peppers. Amber used to date Trevor but now she's going to marry Rob. They read the obituaries in order to find things they can turn into money on the internet. Pretty soon they end up in the destroyed house of a dead dude named Bill Zill and they're also seriously obsessing over watching a surveillance-cam website called fourboxes.tv. Fourboxes.tv is a dusty digital window into the wacked-out world of a creep they call Havoc. Havoc didn't know his apartment was wired up when he moved in. And he's weird. He sleeps in a bat-cage builds bombs in a dungeon and looks like he's planning to kill people on a seriously massive scale. Trevor Amber and Rob decide they have to do something to find and stop Havoc wherever he is. Or...maybe not - they could just keep watching 'cause as Rob says "That's what the internet's for." Havoc's dirty wrecked world couldn't affect them - right? Safe alone deep in the dark clean American suburbs.
