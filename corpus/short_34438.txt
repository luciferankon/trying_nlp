A look at an ant colony with emphasis on the roles of workers warriors queen and drones. An off-screen narrator uses the metaphor of a city throughout. First we watch workers care for eggs and for larva that spin a cocoon. Workers move eggs and larva to cooler or warmer rooms rotate them and help them hatch. We watch a queen and drones go through the mating cycle. Workers continue their jobs and the film ends with the colony's elaborate preparation for a storm.
