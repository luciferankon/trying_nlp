These guys are no ordinary house flippers. They are Robin Hoods taking from the banks and giving back to the sellers. In a typical flip a house is bought all cash or with a loan and the accumulated interest during a flip goes to a bank. Bank Your House offers a 2nd option where our guys are the borrower and the seller is the bank. All the accumulated interest during the flip goes to seller. It's risky but we hope to see a handsome profit for the seller and the guys in the end!
