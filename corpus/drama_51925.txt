Another in the long line of the Trials-and-Tribulations (compounded by Misery and Irony) offerings from Hugo Haas. This time out his character Marko ('Hugo Haas (I)' (qv) is searching for a lost gold mine with his young partner Ray Brighton ('John Agar' )qv)) and despite the fact that Haas appears no more at home playing a prospector than Raymond Hatton would playing a Bulgarian diplomat they find the mine. But Marko decides he doesn't want to share with his partner and figures out a devious and complicated scheme to get rid of him. (Shooting him in the head and burying him in the desert is far too simple a solution in a Haas film.) So Marko ups and marries buxom young Peggy ('Cleo Moore' (qv)) as a marriage of convenience even though past experience would indicate any involvement with a character played by Cleo Moore would not be described as anything close to convenience. Rikor figures that after the three of them spend the winter together in a shack far from civilization he will sooner or later catch them in adultery and he can use the "unwritten law" to kill Brighton and thus escape punishment from the law. But "Murphy's Law" rears its ugly head.
