MY SECRET COUNTRY is a multi-platform journey into the world of imaginative play and a portrait of three children who have invented imaginary friends and worlds. Embedded in this hybrid documentary is a fiction adventure co-written with the film's three children. Using 2D animation we bring to life their collective imaginings and follow their pretend companions on an important mission to save dessert from extinction.
