House is a found footage experimental film. It uses an archival 50's nuclear testing film from the Prelinger archives and reclaims it by re-editing sound and image. Rooted in French 20's surrealism and 80's industrial music House evokes the sense of displaced home and space in a globalized world of divided wealth and poverty.
