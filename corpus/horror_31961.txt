Miguel a mercenary soon learns that La Llorona is anything but a legend when he is commissioned to locate and return a young runaway to a sleepy riverside town in order to rid it of La Llorona's curse. Miguel is successful in recovering the young girl; however as he is nearing the town he swerves to avoid a figure standing in the road and crashes his car. Awakening he finds that the young girl is missing and heads towards the town to find her.
