Dutch filmmakers gathered to make this compilation movie consisting of 17 segments as a reaction to the status quo in The Netherlands after the assassination of filmmaker 'Theo van Gogh (II)' (qv) on November 2 2004. The film is not as much about Van Gogh but rather they are short simple stories told from the sideline. No political analysis no media-trained politicians but a focus on the grief hope and anger of the neighbor the viewer and the tram driver. Stories from the edge of the murder.
