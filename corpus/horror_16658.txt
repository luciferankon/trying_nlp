Hoping to cash in on the final stages of the found-footage phenomenon a shady LA producer hires a small crew of cult-icon has-been and never-were filmmakers to 'whip up' a supernatural first-person perspective ghost story on a pitifully low budget. Along with a handful of amateur actors the group heads into the woods and sets about rigging up 'scares' and planning the story with varying degrees of enthusiasm. After filming the first gag the actors return to base camp to find the crew has been brutally murdered. MOST of the crew anyway... Now the actors are lost far from home and being hunted stalked by a vicious killer with an eye for cinema.
