A brief look at the rise and fall from greatness of various locations in the United States such as Detroit the Salton Sea Hunters Point Naval Shipyard and the towns of Picher Oklahoma and Bodie California. The decay of these sites as they are retaken by nature have strange beauty that is difficult to look away from. Forgotten Planet takes a look at ghost towns in American. It visits Pichard in Oklahoma (abandoned due to mining related lead poisoning) the Salton Sea (abandoned due to fertilizer run on off) Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard (abandoned due to radioactive contamination) Detroit (depopulated due to economic changes) and Bodie in California (abandoned after its mines ran out of gold).
