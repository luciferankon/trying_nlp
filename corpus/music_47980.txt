This 30th Anniversary Special for the legendary Dick Clark TV show "American Bandstand" was released to the public over TV stations on the night of Friday October 30 1981. Dick Clark showed clips from old episodes of the show the clips from the 1950s and 1960s of the most interest. But the most exciting moment in the special was at the end when Dick Clark played a tribute to dead 1950s rocker Bill Haley by having an all-star-jam of "Rock Around the Clock" showing old clips from the 1950s of Bill Haley and his Comets performing the song.
