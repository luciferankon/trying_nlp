A teenager recalls an incident where he and three of his friends used fake IDs to buy and consume alcohol in a bar. Following he was caught by the police and convicted for driving while intoxicated and he and his friends were additionally convicted for fraud for using the fake IDs. An off-screen narrator tells some facts about alcohol its consumption its effect on the human brain and the rationale for having a legal age restriction for its consumption. Despite some positive effects of alcohol when consumed responsibly the narrator also dispels the myth that many teens have that alcohol makes them appear older to others. In this situation the narrator also mentions that the teens' actions have a wider ranging negative effect on the bar itself despite the bar staff doing due diligence in checking ID. The question becomes whether this brief act of wanting to appear older is worth having his driver's license taken away having to sell his car and having a life long criminal record.
