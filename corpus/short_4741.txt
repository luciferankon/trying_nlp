A jaded hipster named Reza -- lost in a dead-end job and a culture of irony and passive recreation -- is struck by the realization that he can't quite seem to care. His free-spirited friend Amy has kept him level until now... but she's moving to Australia in a week and Reza fears that he'll be totally lost without her. Amy vows to kick Reza out of his rut before she leaves and so begins a subtle touching and humorous awakening that includes actual footage of a guy in a bear suit break dancing in a suburban mall.
