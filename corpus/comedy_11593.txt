Although shot simultaneously with the first part director 'VÃ­t Olmer' (qv)'s sequel to the story of three businesswomen dealing in erotic services stands on its own. The film abandons a majority of the topics important to the original and focuses instead on a new plot and characters: the erotic club's new owner introduces an element of crime by blackmailing her customers.
