Circus Aztl√°n which performs in the villages around Mexico City is made up of the members of just one family. They each have their own act: there is a clown-cum-ringmaster a trapeze act a juggler an act with a pony and a pink poodle plus a goat that does tricks. The daughter is thinking about leaving the business but she would miss the circus and the applause she says. She is also very proud of her roots and her profession. Seen from the outside it may look like a life full of adventure but behind the glitter suits and heavy makeup lies a difficult uncertain existence.
