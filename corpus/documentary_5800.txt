Narrated by Robert Redford Saving the Bay explores the history of one of America's greatest natural resources - San Francisco Bay - with four one-hour episodes tracing the Bay from its geologic origins following the last Ice Age through years of catastrophic exploitation to restoration efforts of today. This spectacular high-definition series takes viewers on an unforgettable journey around the waters of San Francisco Bay and the larger northern California watershed from the Sierra Nevada mountains to the Farallon Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The series also highlights the story of three women who rallied an entire region to save San Francisco Bay from becoming little more than a river. Spearheaded by three women in the East Bay hills the story of how the Bay was saved is not only compelling in its own right but offers an invaluable lesson about how ordinary citizens can have an impact on protecting and enhancing our natural environment.
