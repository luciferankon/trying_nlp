30 years ago a hard working road weary musician looking for a place to relax stumbled upon a sleepy little town south of the border. With a little luck and heavy on enthusiasm Sammy Hagar created the Cabo Wabo cantina. Little did he realize his idea for a place to play and invite his friends to would turn into an empire that continues to grow and develop today. As that idea grew so did the town. Cabo San Lucas has become a worldwide tourist destination where many flock not just to hit the beaches but to party with the guy who started it all. The biggest party of the year is reserved for Sammy's birthday where for the past 20+ years he has celebrated October 13th by playing a week of special concerts to promote and help the town he fell in love with. The publicity the intimacy of a small club the special guests who show up unannounced have captivated the redhead nation from around the world to journey to the tip of Baja and celebrate this annual event.
