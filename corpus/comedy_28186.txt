Charly Chiarelli brings his second hit show about growing up Sicilian in Canada to the small screen. Produced by U.b. Wired Productions in association with Bravo! NewStyleArtsChannel Mangiacake! is the second installment in the autobiographical saga that began with Cu'Fu. Part dramatic monologue part stand-up comedy this one-person show is punctuated with Chiarelli's own brand of Sicilian blues and some very fine blues harmonica.
