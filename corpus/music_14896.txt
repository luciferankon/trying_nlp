Starting in 2005 Liga dk became Danish television's weekly music show focusing entirely on Danish music based around a video chart and host Kristian Leth's strong opinions on the music played. Starting out as a half-hour show it was expanded to an hour in 2006 and eventually went through various format changes including the chart being removed in favour of more interviews and features. In 2007 the show now simply called Liga and playing foreign as well as Danish music was cut back to 30 minutes due to scheduling changes only to reappear in a 45 minute version in autumn. Late in the year it was announced that the show would be canceled at the end of the year and that host Kristian Leth would go on to start his own record label.
