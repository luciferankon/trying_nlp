Does alien life exist out there in the Universe Scientists are now getting closer than ever to answering that question thanks to the Kepler Space Telescope. This revolutionary spacecraft is on a mission to find habitable alien planets. Thanks to Kepler we now know of thousands of possible planets and we're getting closer than ever to finding the holy grail: a twin of our Earth. We use CGI to bring these alien worlds to life and with the help of scientists we speculate on what extra-terrestrial life might be like.
