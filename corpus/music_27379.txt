J.J. Cale (1938-2013) recorded live at Leon Russel's Paradise Studios in Los Angeles Ca. in June 1979. Re-discovered i Nashville in 2001 and restored and digitally re-mastered. John Weldon Cale was born in Oklahoma City 1938 and grew up in Tulsa Oklahoma. He later styled himself "JJ" to avoid any confusion with John Cale of the Velvet Underground. Cale was friendly with a fellow Tulsa musician Leon Russell and at his behest moved to Los Angeles where he found regular work. It was there that Cale made his first recordings of his own songs cutting three singles for the Liberty label one of which featured "After Midnight" as a B side. They were not commercially successful however. He returned to Oklahoma and in 1970 he heard Clapton's recording of "After Midnight" an experience he likened to "discovering oil in your own backyard". The producer Audie Ashworth invited Cale to Nashville to record an album which resulted in Naturally (1972). It was released on Russell's Shelter label and tracks included "Call Me the Breeze" "Magnolia" and a new version of "After Midnight" alongside "Crazy Mama" the song that gave Cale his first and only substantial hit as himself going to No 22 on the US singles chart. J.J. Cale recorded 15 solo albums (1972-2009)
