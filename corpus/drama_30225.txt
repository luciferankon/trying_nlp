Akaki is a school teacher. He unexpectedly becomes an inheritor of a dying billionaire who sold his assets around the world and returned to his homeland Georgia. Akaki promises him to become a philanthropist. Anonymously he starts reaching out to different people and funding either their medical needs or different charity organizations. He feels his lifetime won't be enough to help all the people in the world. And his religious background makes him confident - the end is near. Ultimately he believes - "Maybe there will be no Apocalypse there is still hope for the future as long as we do good things for each other".
