The same stage we're in today. In the midst of an unexplainable solar crisis Jeff (Jeff Chapman) mysteriously finds himself traveling back through time when he looks into an eclipse. In an attempt to fix the future he desperately tries to change the past not knowing that nature has a will of its own.
