Today Afghanistan at war is a hot topic across all media throughout the world. The U.S. in particular is focused on Afghanistan as it expands its military involvement. Yet there is another Afghanistan: the Afghanistan of young leaders who want peace. These young leaders do not receive the media attention to broadcast their message for a new Afghanistan. An Afghanistan where the guns and tanks are replaced with teachers books and computers. An Afghanistan where tolerance and human rights replace the hatred and violence so ingrained in the children from birth. Between Light and Darkness aims at giving these young leaders an open multi-media channel for their voices to be heard across the international community. The documentary follows two young leaders who work for a Non-Government Association NGO called PARSA (Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Support for Afghanistan) as they dedicate their lives to empower their people to become educated economically self-sufficient and champions of human rights. Where so many teachers teach hatred Yasin Farid National Director of PARSA teaches tolerance through education and leadership. Palwasha Madomi PARSA Economic Program Director empowers widows to become self-sufficient through entrepreneurial initiatives Their journey becomes personal urgent - no longer mere televised images. Yet their progress is very fragile; their voices unheard; their cries for a good education ignored. There is insufficient funding to train teachers to teach; the University of Kabul has no computers; resources for women's education are few. Between Light and Darkness is the beginning of these leaders' journey. We really wonder how they go on day-in day-out working so hard to heal their country from this perpetual cycle of hatred and violence. What if they collapse from exhaustion or even death? How long can they last without the support of the international community? For if they fail the world around them will never heal.
