Gordon 28 an aspiring animator leaves his home in Oregon to sell his ideas to Hollywood. After being told correctly that they are quite possibly the most stupid ideas ever and that he needs to spend time rethinking them he moves back home. But his father never a kind man escalates his mean treatment of his rather unconventional son. Meanwhile Gord has fallen for Betty an attractive doctor at the hospital where his friend is staying; she happens to use a wheelchair and to delight in having her paralyzed legs beaten with a bamboo cane; her sexual aggression intimidates him. Gord's family goes to a psychiatrist and he lies to her that his father molests Gord's brother Freddy; Gord neglects to mention that Freddy is 25. Soon Gordon has the house to himself and comes up with a winning animated series "Zebras in America" based on his own family. All this is really a framework on which 'Tom Green (III)' (qv) hangs his usual crazy stunts. Tom Green plays Gord Brody a slacker who dreams of becoming an animator for cartoon shows. He is forced to move back in with his parents but then refuses to leave. Along the way he sexually pleasures various farm animals licks open flesh wounds accuses his father of molesting his brother goes scuba diving in a toilet plays an organ with several sausages attached to it which are suspended in midair and does a bunch of other stuff that is too insane offensive disgusting or weird to be mentioned here.
