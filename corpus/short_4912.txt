UNION descends upon New York City for 24 hours and explores the lives of several of its inhabitants. A cab driver hits a bicyclist; a homeless woman dies in grand central station; the police officer who discovers the homeless woman takes out his anger on his young son;- all these stories collide and intersect without any of the players knowing their inter-connection and influence upon one another.
