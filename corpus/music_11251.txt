The bulk of the material in the film was recorded live at The Key Club in Los Angeles on November 22 2003 with many post-production shots mixed in with the live clips. The title itself "Disease is Punishment" could be a very obscure reference to the band Devo who the Network is heavily influenced by. Disease is Punishment is a live DVD featuring songs from The Network's first album Money Money 2020. The project directed by John Roecker with visuals & music videos directed/produced by Roy Miles of AntiDivision was conceptualized to be a more a film than a concert DVD as evidenced by the collages in between songs.
