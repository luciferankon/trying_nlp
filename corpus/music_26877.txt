In early 2013 Neil Finn and Paul Kelly (two of the best songwriters of their generation) put together a concert tour that was in every sense the highlight of 2013. Kelly and Finn delved into each other's catalogues rummaging around for their favourite tunes; trying new things on songs that had become part of the nation's fabric. Recorded at the Sydney Opera House Goin' Your Way is a sublime meeting of talents a once-in-a-lifetime re-imagining of Australia's favourite songs providing simply one of the greatest concert experiences of this century.
