Nighttown represents nearly twenty years of music history in Rotterdam city The Netherlands. In this danceclub and pop venue situated on the Dutch cultural artery 'West Kruiskade' not only different cultures from the streets came together but also the pop and dance cultures in the broadest sense gathered here. Until in 2006 the curtain falls ... Ex-Nighttown program creator Marcel Haug and external organizer Mike Redman made a film in which old staff artists and followers explain what the force of Nighttown was. A documentary full of memoirs legendary concerts (The Ramones Amy Winehouse Johnny Cash Ice Cube Underworld and many others) and never seen before footage.
