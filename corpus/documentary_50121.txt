L.A Roll weaves together the lives of a group of dance roller skaters facing a myriad of social and economic pressures to create a kaleidoscopic snapshot of a vibrant Los Angeles subculture over the course of a year as they search for a rink to call home. Although this rhythm skating community is thriving more and more rinks have closed as the city rapidly expands and gentrifies leaving only the rinks outside the city's edges. This predominantly black skating community is stretched thin and skaters struggle to balance their work lives in order to travel even further to maintain this rich culture. L.A. Roll tells a story of how communities can uplift and support each other while navigating racial economic and social tensions. Wheels and bodies spinning atop wood skating rink floors provide a backdrop for us to witness this inspiring multi-generational community in motion and joy.
