from the Bari Balafon Film Festival 2008 program director Koblan Bonaventura Amissah: "The family of Mouloud a peasant in the Algerian mountains is overwhelmed by a tragic loss: their soldier son has been killed in an ambush. With stubborn patience Mouloud sets off on a motor tricycle to Algiers to get his son's body. The journey is difficult and painful through the harsh landscape of the mountains and a thousand bureaucratic and administrative setbacks. When he returns home the battle is not over. Mouloud now has to fight the sadness and give new meaning to his life and that of his wife who has been cloistered in profound silence by her sorrow."
