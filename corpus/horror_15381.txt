Four friends get sidetracked on their way to a vacation. They meet a family of adult siblings who invite them for dinner. One of the siblings is very welcoming but the others must have been born from a different mold. The siblings were raised from the bible's words but everyone's interpretation isn't always agreeable on what sin is.
