In America alone there have been over 1500 newspaper accounts of giant skeletons being found including 3781 skeletons of a race of blond haired giants exhumed on Catalina Island CA in 1920. The fact is there are many credible accounts of such discoveries including giants with double rows of teeth and in some cases six fingers. So where is the evidence?
