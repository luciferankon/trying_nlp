This is the story of Hasani living in the village of Shalamrood; But not the children's story version but the real true story that really did happen. He was a troubled little boy as the villagers used to say. With messy black hair dirty nails and filthy clothes. All he ever wanted was to play and to feel loved but the parents told their children they mustn't play with him. So the kids made fun of him teasing the way he was and to Hasani's sadness it affected him leaving him more alone than ever. Even the animals were afraid of him and ran away when he wanted to play. Hassani's mom who raised him and her other two children alone was very worried and heartbroken for her son and tried to help him but Hassani only wished to play with other children. So the elder of the village told people he was cursed and ominous because wherever he put his foot on any farmer's land their sheep died and the only way to help him and their village was to wash him in the lake. The children all went to Hassani and took him to the lake. This was the best day of his life. The joy he had lighted up the sky. They never heard him laugh so heartedly and full of passion. The kids as they were told by their parents took his hand and led him into the lake and surrounded him washing all his dirtiness away. He didn't mind if some of the kids were rough or still teasing how ugly and filthy he was he was happy just as it was at least they were playing with him. Unfortunately the kids didn't know he wasn't able to swim or some rumors say they did and led him to the deeper end of the lake and let go of his hands. He screamed and shouted for help but the children just stared at him. Even passing villagers just watched as he sank into the deep water and drowned.
