Every September 'the Ginsengers' of North Carolina set out to earn a big payday... "to get while the gettin's good!" The price of White Panax Ginseng has hit $1200 per pound but the real prize is the "Monster 'Seng" root which can fetch upwards of $10000. We follow four teams led by Ricky "The Legend" Reece Carl "The Goat" Bateman "The Ranger" Cody White and "Young Gun" J.R. Parker. These mountain people cherish this federally protected endangered species. They want to conserve as they forage and only take fully mature ginseng. As well as fierce competition from other Ginsengers they face treacherous rocky terrain poachers rattlesnakes and bears.
