The film begins as a raunchy Bollywood sex farce and evolves into a gritty psychological thriller.It opens with a trio of thrill-seeking ennui-ridden housewives plotting and scheming to indulge in a torrid game of "husband swapping" on a beach vacation. Unsurprisingly the husbands each concur; one Aryan (Siddarth Koirala) falls in love with a girl named Megha (Henna Rehman) whom he saves from drowning. He fails to realize however that she's married to the wealthy tycoon Raj (Aryan Vaid) - albeit grossly unhappily. When the couples return to the city horrid violence begins to plague Raj and Megha - Raj survives numerous attacks on his life and Megha turns up dead. Naturally Aryan is the foremost suspect - though it remains unclear if he is guilty or if someone else bears responsibility.
