Shy and overweight Tanya is a social misfit whose one desire in life is to fit in. While searching the deep web she finds what she is looking for...or so she thinks. What starts out as an attempt to achieve physical perfection turns into a nightmare not only for Tanya but also for a variety of outcasts and anyone they feel has wronged them. Tanya will learn the hard way that things aren't always what they seem and that everything...including perfection...comes with a price.
