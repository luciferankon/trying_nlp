The American public is increasingly interested in healthy eating but many people have poor access to healthy food. The documentary Food Frontiers explores a variety of projects from around the U.S. that are improving access. The people driving these projects are begging people to steal their ideas - any or all of them - and make them their own. Food Frontiers covers projects ranging from supermarket development to farmers' markets to community-based cooking education - all of them aimed at solving the problem of "food deserts." The film profiles a pioneer in the farm-to-school movement a citrus grower who helps rescue his farm (and his neighbors' farms) by supplying fruits and vegetables to local schools some dynamic high school students who run a rural grocery store in Nebraska and a Virginia pediatrician who prescribes cooking classes for her patients and their parents. This film was produced by the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future and will be included in the Center's free online high school curriculum about the food system to be launched in August 2016.
