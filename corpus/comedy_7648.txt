Francesco the director is from San Donato. A dreamer with a candid soul he is inspired to make a film about his neighborhood through the thwarted-love story between a roma girl and a local gagƒç boy a talented and promising boxer. To give his film a sense of local authenticity he decides to organize an acting laboratory. That's when the problems begin. First: no roma girl answers the ad for someone to play the love interest. As if that's not enough all his attempts to meet roma girls are vain. The Gym is a fictional documentary that tells the story of a director's attempt to make a movie about the roma people of his home town or rather "with roma people" as he himself specified. But once he got in touch with their world his project was called into question: their reality didn't correspond to what he had imagined. Gradually and not without resistance the director enters a world that he had previously known only through stereotypes and discovers its value and beauty.
