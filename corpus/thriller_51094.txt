Lifeboat 715 is the ultimate experiment. Twenty-four strangers. One room. No script but countless secrets and lies. When Meredith Rhiannon Jimi Alexis Calvin and Sarah awaken in a strange room they have no idea how they got there and barely know each other. Calvin is in handcuffs. Sarah is still wearing her apron. And Jimi blames the Illuminati - especially when he's twitching on the floor. Sergeant Knox and Agent Noach seem to know what's going on - but they also look like teenagers with a sniper rifle. A screen counts down from two hours. But two hours to what?
