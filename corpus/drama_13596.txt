Threads of Belonging depicts the daily life of "Layton House" a fictional therapeutic community where doctors live with their schizophrenic patients. The characters and events of Layton House were drawn from writings of the anti-psychiatry movement  whose most famous proponent was R.D. Laing. In this film we see experimental therapies power struggles and the individual arcs of mental illness converge as a community struggles to understand itself and determine its destiny.
