A young couple settles down in a large abandoned industrial warehouse. An orange strip glued to the floor partitions the area in two equal portions: to the right his sculpture atelier; to the left her dance studio. Pendular takes place in this setting where art performances and intimacy mingle together; and where the characters slowly lose their capacity of distinguishing between their artistic projects their past and their romantic relationship.
