DENNIS sits in the passenger seat. Stunned. He quickly wipes the blood from his face. Then looks at the LITTLE GIRL in the back. She stares forward speechless. In the driver's seat is RANDY-slumped over the steering wheel. A gaping hole in the side of his dead. The kidnapping is not going well. Panicking Dennis turns to the Little Girl. His gun is still her hand-one bullet lighter now.
