Over the last three decades Brian Moore has searched out drank and recorded over 38000 different beers yes that is 'thirty-eight THOUSAND'. He is the undisputed Champion Beerticker of Britain... and probably the world! Beerticking or scooping as it's also known is where the traditionalists lie. Having allegedly grown out of the Train spotting era Beerticking has an unwritten and very strange set of rules (often flouted). The tickers travel the length and breadth of the country and some travel the world in search of new cask conditioned beers that they can drink and 'tick' before adding to their ever-growing list. From this hobby a community of enthusiastic and eccentric drinkers has formed and they are the basis for this 70 minute documentary entitled 'BEERTICKERS: beyond the ale'. Following Brian the Champ Dave Unpronounceable Mick the Tick and Gazza Prescott the film is a journey into the world of collecting and Britain's national drink... real ale. As alcohol is further taxed and binge drinking dominant in the media the film maker explores the hobby of beer ticking and its position in a far bigger context of beer history and national pride. This is a film about obsession identity curiosity and tradition. This documentary film is an exploration of the collectors psyche and of Great British drinking culture - not to mention a severe test of one film maker's affection for and dedication to beer.
