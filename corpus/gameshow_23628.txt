Speedrunners take turns demonstrating their prowess at beating various video games in the quickest possible time done in front of an audience as well as a livestream through Twitch.tv. Sometimes these runs may be executed in an unusual or specific way such as fully completing every level completing a game blindfolded or featuring multiple runners racing against one another to complete a game first. Video games run in Games Done Quick events include both retro and modern titles. The runs typically feature commentary from the runner(s) or experienced commentators as well as donation messages read by an announcer. Most of the popular runs feature video game glitches and discussion between the runner and the commentators most frequently describing techniques or using observational humor and banter. Humor and banter is especially used for non-interactive or repetitive sequences that don't require the runner to use much or any skill. Donations from viewers may feature humorous comments that contain inside jokes among the speedrunning community as well as more personal acknowledgements concerning the charity donated to. Because of the live broadcast and wider audience runners and commentators are encouraged to refrain from using strong profanity and offensive behavior.
