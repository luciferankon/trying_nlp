Leah joins a playgroup with baby three to make up for missed playdates with her other kids while a workaholic. She enters a group of crazies. This is therapy. Tifany Queen Bee Mom and her side kick Sinnomin Ditzy Mom are at battle with the Tiger mom and her court mandated life coach/yogi (what? exactly!) the hippie mom that's still breastfeeding her son (he's 15!) and the gay work from home Dad (the only normal one in the group.) They are lead by Ms. Barbara Ph.T: Playgroup Helper and Therapist (No that's not a real thing) who always wanted to be a therapist but failed out of college. She's convinced she's their therapist and Leah is her newest study. As competitive as they seem they keep returning maybe for unity maybe for their kids to play maybe because the playgroup has a babysitter (score!) ok it's really for the shirtless foreign male model that serves wine at the end of every session.
