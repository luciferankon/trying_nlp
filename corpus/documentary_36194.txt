7-year-old Robbie has a rare gut condition called Pseudo Obstruction which has resulted in various surgeries as well as a stoma - a surgically created opening from the bowel through the abdomen - something many children with the condition struggle to cope with.We follow the journey of a teddy bear from a Canterbury factory to a charity sewing group in the Highlands of Scotland where the bear is specially adapted with it's own stoma and finally onto Robbie in Glasgow to see how it changes his life.
