After Atlas drops a dirty bomb and transforms the dead into bloodthirsty zombies the infection makes its way back to the last Atlas Corporation branch still standing where all victims are still in their Exo Suits. Now a janitor a CEO a security officer and an IT Tech are all that remains to fight off a whole new threat of zombies. During the war Atlas dropped a DNA Bomb. Anyone not entered into its genetic code was killed. However the dead came back as zombies as a side effect and Atlas took some to a Bio Lab. However some of the zombies broke out and they infected the entire compound. Kahn Lillith Oz and Decker are the only four survivors. After being over run however Atlas saves them. They are then sent to a Burgertown Atlas Facility which is then overrun with infected. After rescuing survivors a Sentinel Warbird comes in and 'saves' them. Lennox (Bruce Campbell) the Sentinel Commander then comes out and shoots Oz claiming that Oz was the source of the infection. He then proceeds to load the group up on a warbird. They then go to an Atlas ship. However Oz is revived as a zombie. The Atlas ship is then infected. As the group of survivors (Lennox now joining the remaining 3) is about to escape zombie Oz appears and comes at them.
