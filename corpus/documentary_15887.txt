Every two years the farmers of the African village of Kwen Burkina Faso organize a Carnival which takes place far from those of Venice and Rio. Over three days and two nights the locals dress up as the officials of the nation - the President Prime Minister Ministers of Justice Security and Agriculture and the King and Queen. Chosen by the elders the most hard-working young farmers act out their country's political leaders on stage. The festival which has been taking place since the 1940s but has never before been captured in a documentary intends to encourage the young people to work in the fields and celebrate the nourishing forces of the land.
