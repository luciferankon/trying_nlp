A huge spruce is cut down in the mountains to be used as a Christmas tree in the center of Sofia. As it is transported across the country it becomes the link between six stories that explore celebration or the luck of celebration in the everyday lives of the protagonists. The structure of the film is fragmentary as our life is these days and the stories resemble snapshots of existence - moments of cruelty and longing of beauty and disgrace... The tree is already decorated - the celebration may began!
