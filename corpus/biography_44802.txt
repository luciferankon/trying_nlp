This film looks at the life of George Washington Orton and attempts to determine why he was shunned ignored and basically forgotten in his native land despite his many successes. At the same time questions arise as to the whereabouts of his 1900 Olympic gold medal which was considered to be a victory for America at the time but 75 years later was officially credited to Canada. Mark Hebscher seeks out the truth about the mysterious life of an American sporting icon who as we later found out was actually the first Canadian to win an Olympic gold medal. Nobody knew it at the time but Orton's roots were deeply Canadian. Many years after his death Olympic researchers discovered that this man with a uniquely American name was actually born raised trained and educated in Canada before leaving at the age of 20.
