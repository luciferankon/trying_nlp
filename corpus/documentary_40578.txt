Each person gets to drugs and addiction in their own way. The ways out however are subject to severe rules. And it is not only about willing or possibly being able to walk these ways; it is also about being allowed to walk them. When you get to the community you have already taken all the steps up to dependence. You have even been a street dealer. You have sold drugs to others just like yourself so you could pay the shots without which you were a living corpse.
