Dr. Tony Menzies is the chief resident of a rundown understaffed Adult Emergency Services emergency room located in New York's inner city. Much like "Barney Miller" the characters comment on the craziness of big-city life while seemingly acting as loony as the people they try to help. And like Barney Miller everyone looks to the witty Menzies--the sanest nut in the asylum--for guidance.
