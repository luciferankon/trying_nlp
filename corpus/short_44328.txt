Five Dacoits after doing the robbery hide themselves outside the village. They have got the robbed cash and gold with them. They have been travelling whole night and they don't even have any food stuff with them. They start fighting amongst themselves because of the starvation and finally they come to conclusion that the path being a way to the farms some one might pass from their with some breakfast. And they will snatch the breakfast from that person to fulfil their hunger. In some time one farmer along with the breakfast passes through that same way and these people snatch the breakfast from him. But that breakfast does not fulfil the hunger of these Dacoits. So they threaten the farmer to make a call from his phone at his place and to call for the food. Farmer calls his wife she gets afraid after listening to him but then farmer gives her courage for not to get afraid and also not to tell anyone in the village about this thing. He tells her that the Dacoits are starving badly so if we give them the food they will release me. Question arises in mind of farmers wife about what to cook and on the other side expectation of the Dacoits increases and they ask for meat and bread. She cooks meat for Dacoits and at the same time she also hides the entire incident from the village people. She takes the food to the Dacoits and gets her husband released.
