'Dead Mall' evocatively floats through the kitsch design cheesy floor tiling lilting muzak empty parking lots indifferent clerks shuttered storefronts soft light and neon letters glass and plastic and worn carpet and tiny mom-n-pop businesses that have replaced the major chain outlets in a struggling shopping mall that's in stark danger of closing for good. This avant-garde documentary is a haunting meditation on a time when the American perspectives on consumerism and capitalism were vastly different than they are today.
