Lajos Mezei is a middle-aged insignificant average man. He works at the post office sorting letters with a machine. His life is but a series monotonous everyday events but he has a passion that makes him different from his fellow humans. This passion replaces all human relationships and events in his life. He flees into a world of his own hermetically sealed which only he can understand and where he therefore feels safe. One day however his well-balanced life is turned upside down.
