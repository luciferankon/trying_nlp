The Conquest of the Desert was the offensive of the Argentine State to evict the indigenous peoples of Patagonia in order to advance over vast portions of land fragment them and market them. Beyond the military campaign there were a series of extermination operations. An unwritten final solution supported by forced exodus concentration camps the elimination of the indigenous families through starvation disease or slave labor. The protagonists of The Invisible History are descendants of the Mapuches who are trying to reconstruct their original identity. The film makes the wound which is still open visible in order to make room for debate on a different conception of the country inclusive and multicultural.
