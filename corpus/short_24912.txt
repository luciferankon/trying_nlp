This is the story of a small group of river surfing pioneers who are sculpting a world-class wave on the Kananaskis River forty-five minutes outside of landlocked Calgary Alberta Canada. Over the years Neil Egsgard and Jacob Kelly Quinlan among others have molded a standing wave called The Mountain. They have not only built a wave but also a river surfing community. The goal of their project called Surf Anywhere (from which this film takes its name) is to create sustainable river surfing communities throughout the world. The river surfing revolution is here. Surf Anywhere - coming soon to a river near you.
