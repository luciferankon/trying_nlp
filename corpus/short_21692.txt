Mary Wilkens an elderly retired woman begins to feel ill and consults a Dr. Forrest Jacksburg whose unusual healing methods that don't seem to help Mary at all make Mary's husband Fred suspicious. Fred goes to Dr. Jim Stewart for help and they write to the American Medical Association to get any information on Dr. Jacksburg. The AMA uses its advanced research skills looking through their files of all medical doctors in the U.S. and Canada. It soon becomes clear that Dr. Jacksburg is a medical quack whose license was already revoked once in the state and once Mary testifies against him in court Dr. Jacksburg's clinic is closed and a warrant is put out for his arrest.
