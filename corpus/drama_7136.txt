Field of Martyrs is a web series about an intensified global persecution of Christians following a worldwide economic collapse. Much like Nero's persecution of Christians after the fire of Rome in 64 A.D. in the near future anyone who is tagged with the generic derogatory term "mono" i.e. as a monotheist has become the designated scapegoat. The New World Order is being built in the name of "Logic and Peace" by a spilling of the blood of martyrs on a scale dwarfing all previous persecutions in history. Catholics are tagged with the specific derogatory term "cannie" short for "cannibal" a mocking reference to their Eucharistic practices. Now the "cannies" are being methodically eliminated worldwide by death squads. "Field of Martyrs" focuses on a local persecution headed up by the cruel and ruthless Ana Santana ("The Priest Hunter") and her local squad of Guardians empowered under global martial law. The "Field" in "Field of Martyrs" refers to a legendary although some say mythical vineyard that could hold the key for the underground.
