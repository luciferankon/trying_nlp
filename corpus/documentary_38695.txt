With over 1500 films released each year Nigeria has become the world's third most important film producer after the United States (Hollywood) and India (Bollywood). Nollywood's films are shot in no time with a small budget and although their quality may be questionable Nigerians do love them. Rightly so. These are films that are shot by Africans for Africans. They are sold in the streets in CD or DVD formats. Their stories unfold in Southern Christian communities or in Northern Muslim regions. They mix action romance religion and sometimes even magic. In short these films are a sheer reflection of this country. Welcome to Nigeria. Welcome to Nollywood.
