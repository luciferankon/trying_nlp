People from all over Sweden write in to "Det Okända" when they feel that they have been visited by spirits from beyond the veil. Sometimes they are frightened sometimes they are convinced it's a loved one visiting them but what they all have in common is that they want to find out what the spirits want. A team of mediums are on standby to help the families - but they are told nothing about what the family has experienced. Instead they must attempt to connect to the spirits and gain their information that way. The mediums tell the family and the cameras what impressions they are getting and what type of connection they are making. They also try to get as many details about the person they are in contact with as possible and try to find out what the spirits are doing in the house. Sometimes the family will recognize the spirits and sometimes the spirits are connected to the house or the area rather than the family. Sometimes the mediums connect with a spirit that has been unable to cross over to the other side and have to help them over or "cleanse" the home. Sometimes just finding out what the spirit wants makes the phenomena stop. After the medium has completed his or her work the TV-team compiles the information about the spirits and tries to find out more about them. In the cases when the families have recognized a relative or friend this is relatively easy but with older lingering spirits or ones that are connected to the area there is a fair bit of research done as the team try to find proof that all the people the medium had contact with really existed. Sometimes it is impossible to verify sometimes it becomes obvious who the mediums where in contact with. "Det Okända" works with some of Sweden's foremost mediums and prides itself on the fact that unlike many shows about mediums they never "cheat". There is no research done in advance and the mediums aren't given any information in advance not even an address. It is also entirely unscripted.
