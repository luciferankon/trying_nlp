The first documentary film ever to explore the 4000 year-old epicenter of spiritual transformation located in Teotihuacan Mexico and the mystical pyramids altars and transformative energy that make this location one of the great pathways through time truth and consciousness. This is the place where man awakens to God. The Teotihuacanos built the pyramids to guide their people through the ascending levels of consciousness and 2000 years later a handful of Toltec spirit guides remain. For the first time ever a few of the most prominent Toltec guides invited a handpicked camera crew along to film the journey as it unfolded in real time over 5 powerful days in May.
