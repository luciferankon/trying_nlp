The demand for covering of the female body in ways that exceed any norm of commonsense. . . Objectification of the female body in society setting rules for how it should be covered and all forms of manipulation around it have been continuing in various ways in both the East as well as the West despite ongoing outcries of women. It is such a form of violence that invades not only the female body but the minds of women as well. The Lamenting Body addresses the question of violence against the female body from the viewpoint of Shadi Mousavi an Iranian female painter. Her paintings reveal this less spoken and less visible violence. Through this confrontation Shadi's mind perceives the female body as a wounded scattered entity in blood. Her works are subjected to censorship due to the fact that the very scope of the confrontation reveals these grim facts starkly. The Lamenting Body is an outcry against this violence and the outcry itself faces violence in the form of censorship.
