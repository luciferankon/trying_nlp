I'm Just Anneke is a portrait of a 12-year-old girl who loves ice hockey and has a loving close-knit family. Anneke is also a hardcore tomboy and everybody she meets assumes she's a boy. The onset of puberty has created an identity crisis for Anneke. Does she want to be a boy or a girl when she grows up or something in between? To give her more time to make a decision her doctor has put her on Lupron a hormone blocker that temporarily delays the hormones of adolescence. Despite rejection by her friends and struggles with suicidal depression Anneke is determined to be true to herself and maintain a gender fluid identity that matches what she feels on the inside. I'm Just Anneke takes us into the heart of a new generation of children who are intuitively questioning the binary gender paradigm.
