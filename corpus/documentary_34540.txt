It all started with a miracle when a Virgin appeared on a hill near Tilcara Jujuy (NO Argentine) giving back the locals the protection of the sacred. Since then thousands of pilgrims arrive to El Abra every year in gratefulness after a challenging pilgrimage. Sikuris bands (musicians) are central actors in a ceremony. We follow "Territorios Argentinos" one of the oldest sikuris bands to take up the three days of non-stop walk where only few foreigners dare.
