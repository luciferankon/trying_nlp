A newly rich couple under the impression that Cockney racing tout Evans is a championship-winning trainer (he isn't) ask him if he can train a racehorse they have just bought. It turns out that they don't know anything about horse racing but think that having a championship racehorse will be their ticket into "society". Evans agrees but since he doesn't have a stable moves the horse into the quarters he shares with two lodgers. Surprisingly the horse has an innate talent for racing and could well be a champion. Evans enters him in the big championship race but the day before it is to take place the horse is stolen.
