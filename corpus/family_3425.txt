Being laid off is already not a pleasure cruise but all the less so when your nine-year-old kid is pissed off at you because you are unable to buy the four-wheel drive he has already boasted about to his friends. And when your wife can't put up with for being ALWAYS at home. Or when you ARE NOT in she despises you for giving a hand to a pal who holds a French Fries stand at the fair... Poor Eric! He was Oh So quiet when he was overworked as a landscape architect...!
