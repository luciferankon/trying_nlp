The famous stage production of A Walk Worthwhile by legendary writing duo 'Jirí Suchý (I)' (qv) & 'Jirí Slitr' (qv) was created for Semafor Theatre in 1965. Several generations of audiences grew up on the original music of Jirí Slitr the poetic texts of Jirí Suchý and the entire Semafor ensemble. 'Milos Forman' (qv) and 'Ján Rohác' (qv) shot A Walk Worthwhile in 1966 as a television film _Dobre placená procházka (1966) (TV)_ (qv). The new premiere of the theatre production was held in Prague's National Theatre in 2007 directed by Milos Forman in association with his sons director 'Petr Forman' (qv) and stage designer 'Matej Forman' (qv); and this also gave rise to a new film version of the exquisitely staged comic jazz opera.
