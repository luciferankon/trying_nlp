Two generations of professional baseball players return for a reunion game at one of their minor league stops en route to the big leagues. Unbeknownst to them the owner of the club on his way to a month of rustic living in the high Asian elevations and desiring a connection to home arranges an inducement to get the players to reveal novel anecdotes from their past 'on and off the field' baseball lives. The only apparent commonality between the two groups is their success on the ball field each team providing the locals with the only two minor league championships for the small town nestled in the valley of the Allegheny Mountains.
