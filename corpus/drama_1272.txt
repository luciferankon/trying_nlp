George Wall is a retired New York City police detective and now owner of Ruby's Bar. Once a month he gathers with his old police crew for a "Bulls' Night Out" of drinking and fellowship. One night the bar is held up by a young junkie. George and his retired police friends teach the bandit a lesson in street justice and determine with the neighborhood sliding into drug-fueled violence and the police seeming to have their hands tied that they are in a unique position to up-end the drug activity. So George and the bulls prowl by night putting the fear of God into the local drug dealers until their vigilante actions go horribly wrong. The retired detectives turn on each other as their lives are forever changed.
