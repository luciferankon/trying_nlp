The history of gender equality has undergone different stages and can be understood in diverse ways; that is why this program takes a historic approach to the evolution of inequality - and early struggles to counteract it - all the way up to the appearance of the birth-control pill and with it the beginning of "women's lib." In order to conceptualize sexual differentiation and gender equality moments are explored from the earliest traces of humanity to the decade of the 1970's which was decisive in the feminist struggle and marked the beginning of the contemporary age.
