Add to the clan Greg's younger sister Shell a uni student and budding left wing extremist and things are prone to go very very south!

Will Barb keep her abattoir open despite formidable opposition and subjugation from the local band of radicals? Will Darlene and Bass make it to the altar? Will Shell realise the error of her ways?
