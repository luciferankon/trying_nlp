When Caroline's cat Tibby disappears and then returns sleeker and healthier than before Caroline experiences every stage of grief...and betrayal. Where has her companion been? Has trust been forever breached? Is their relationship at an end? Her friend Wendy suggests modern tracking surveillance technology to uncover Tibby's traitorous excursions and they find themselves embarking on not only a cat's eye view of the world but on a voyage of discovery about where true love really lies - sometimes right in front of our eyes if we're only able to see it.
