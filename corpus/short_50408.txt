'Sky Source' makes water from air using atmospheric generators to turn moisture in the air into fresh drinking water. Each Sky Source model is capable of producing up to 300 gallons of fresh water per day enough for a household or emergency relief efforts and can do so more efficiently than any other method of extraction or filtration. 'Precipitating Change' is a short film on architect David Hertz who has integrated 'Skysource' into his studio to produce up to 150 gallons of water per day. The water is then offered to the public of Venice Beach CA for free as well as to a local NGO Community Healing Gardens.
