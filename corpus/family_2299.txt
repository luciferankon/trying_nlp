Be the Church centers around the life of a 20-something PR major who struggles to control her tongue in both her professional and personal lives. Her drive for authenticity wreaks havoc when the church hires her to spin a scandal and she takes it a whole new direction as she works to reconcile her two worlds. The series seeks to own all the messiness of doing 'church' in a modern world but also examines why anyone would stay... in a snarky quirky and comedic light.
