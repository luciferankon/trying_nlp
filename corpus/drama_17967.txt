Bijan asks Manou to meet so that he can tell the story of Kami: Kami's father has passed away and he is introduced to the Agha that has conducted the funeral. A friendship develops between Kami and Agha based around meeting every Wednesday for lunch followed by an opium smoking session and reading of Rumi poetry.
