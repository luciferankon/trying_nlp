This short essay film is based on Crow/Apsaalooke native tribal cosmology in which air characterizes one of the four cardinal points and when called upon represents a powerful blessings for the people. In this film Dakaake or Bird represents air. The traditional Crow story accompanying this film "The Story of Moon and His Bride" was first written down by Helen Pease Wolf. The story was read for this film by her great-granddaughter Ramona Russell Real Bird. An experimental documentary this short film unfolds with a dreamlike weaving of text and image.
