What can we do theater people? The mortification of not being able to plead in times like this any appropriate gesture faced with the painful helplessness of the theater or art more broadly given the violence and madness the artist can only try to continue to do their work well. This reflection by Strehler written on the occasion of the massacre of Piazza Fontana started the idea of this film on the Piccolo Teatro of Milan whose story is completed by the events of the host city. He always says that the theater is full of ectoplasm but there between the holes in Fontana these are visible and bring us extraordinary memoirs.
