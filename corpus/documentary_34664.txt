An experimental film using a mixture of techniques to portray the different views of the human body. It consists of seven parts each one presenting an ideotype of the human body from the beginning of civilization up to the present time. The body as a concept or dogma is simply the embodied reflection of every civilization upon which man himself is established. The anthropomorphism that characterizes the sum total of perception in a clear or latent state comes from the fact that the human body as reality idea and expression comprises the ultimate reference.
