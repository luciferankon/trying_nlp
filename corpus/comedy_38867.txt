Comedy film and theatre project set inside a train. The whole story is set inside a train carriage. Due to an engine failure the journey is dragging on without knowing when it will end. The only information received is from the "camp" voice of the main train driver blasting away throughout the train at regular intervals. The passengers are forced to endure this pushing them to the limits. During the journey they all speak to each other either together and in unison or they are responding to their own respective conversation without even acknowledging their receiver's end conversation all veering deep to what is in fact their own monologue. No one is really listening to what the other one has to say but the interaction is still vibrant and often high-ended. Toward the end it's almost like if all the passengers were talking to a brick wall; but the difference is that a brick hasn't got a face or a sound. All the groups share the same conversation but never interact between and with the different groups. They only share the same train of thought(s).
