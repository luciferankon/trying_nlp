Duke is a modern day telling of a classic western film. Dare and Roost are brothers who have been raised in a reformatory taught to survive and conditioned to trust no one. They have moved to West Los Angeles where Dare moonlights himself as a Detective and Roost blankets himself in old John Wayne films and reclusive habit. Cleaning the streets and ridding the neighborhoods of scum this contemporary study finds Dare obsessed with a phantom like criminal (Winky) who seems to be terrorizing the community. Simultaneously the same exact investigation is being led by official and likely engrossed Detective Robert Morrison. As Dare closes in on Winky and the entire department closes in on them both these brothers must make the ultimate commitment and pay the extraordinary consequences therein.
