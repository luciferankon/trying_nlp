Tinhoko has included images from no fewer than three different continents (asia europe and the usa) in its video Spatial Lines. White orthogonal lines glide over the screen in opposite directions as the final definitive visible element. The video sequences arranged under this planimetric animation constantly change color and format are deformed and separated without pause. The process continues until the individual shots are reduced to microstructures which form additional layers of sediment. The varying speeds of the various visual levels create a fascinating polyrhythm and cleverly arranged changes in velocity and breaks provide additional dynamism. In a manner similar to tinhoko's normal work method H.Kulisch employed the samples he collected during various trips as raw material for the soundtrack. A gentle melancholy tenor underlies this opulent and sensitively composed fabric of graphics animation and video allowing the viewer to suspect more than is actually shown. (Norbert Pfaffenbichler)
