In 1920s Turkey a young peasant is smitten with a beautiful young girl who has been promised in marriage to the fat dullard cousin of the province's powerful and corrupt governor. When an assassination attempt is made against the official the young man flees his village and joins up with a group of outlaws fighting against the wealthy and powerful landowners who control the lives of the locals and make life miserable for them. The outlaws' successes prompt the governor to call in the Turkish army to capture or kill them.
