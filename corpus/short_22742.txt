An experimental film re-appropriating "The Adventures of Batman" into a parody of a Leni Riefenstahl-esque Nazi propaganda film replete with nationalistic fervor and disturbing undercurrents of anti-Semitism. Intended to act as a critique of superhero films in general which have been noted by critics to contain inherently fascistic undertones. Note that the German translations are so poor as to be practically gibberish -- this is actually intentional.
