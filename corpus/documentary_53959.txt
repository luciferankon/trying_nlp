Life...What's The Point? In this thought provoking documentary we follow the lives of three people suffering with diverse life problems. There is Taylor a young woman who deals with depression; Aviane who experiences mental illness; and Julius who suffers with gender identity. All these issues plus much more will be discovered and revealed in a small town in Virginia where the skyline run-down mill and empty fields haunt the heart of our country. Everyone wonders what is the purpose of this mundane thing we call living. This film attempts to get to the bottom of this universal question. Is there a reason for what we do or are we just running around in circles until we die? Life...What's the point?
