During the Nineteenth Century a number of women were admitted into an Asylum manifesting pseudo-epileptic fits. They were diagnosed as suffering from Hysteria. Looking back Andre Breton would describe these women as the 'greatest poetic discovery of the late nineteenth century.' Women during this period were regarded as being too sensual thereby open to manias of all kinds and therefore requiring a great deal of censure to prevent them from becoming Hysterical which untreated would surely lead to becoming insane. In fact women were seen as the carriers of madness.
