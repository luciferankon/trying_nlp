A "This is Spinal Tap" for the world of film schools this mockumentary follows the careers of 7 film school students from their first day of film class at UNY (whose graduates work "here to Kentucky.")until one is chosen as the winner of the school's Filmic Achievement Award. We meet Delvo Christian who desperately wishes hew were French and has 400.000 feet of undeveloped film 'gestating" in grocery bags in his apartment. In his mother's basement we meet Mike Pack who worships Quentin Tarantino but whose mother may be the real director in the family. Those are just 2 of the students overseen by by faculty like Buck Felty who becomes a little too excited by his students' film pitches and Selway Cascade who insists that she left her ego back in her apartment and who listens to student input because well she is obligated to. The stereotypes are drawn broadly and the situations are absurd yet the characters and script are [frighteningly] believable. WORLD PREMIERE 29th Annual Cleveland International Film Festival.
