The Late show which only ran for two years was one of the most successful and funny comedy shows ever produced and shown in Australia. It marked the re-grouping of the D-Generation a comedy group from the late 80's. From the LIVE late night comedy show came classic moments such as Shitscared Charlie the wonder dog The Oz brothers and heaps of other 'Champagne Comedy'.
