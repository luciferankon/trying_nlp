Following the participants who one after the other are voted off the sixth and seventh season of the Danish 'Robinson Expedition'. Earlier in season 1 to 5 the participants had to spent their remaining days on an exotic hotel once they were voted out of the competition. To their big surprise in this sixth season there is no hotel waiting for them no hot baths no dinners. Instead the participants are thrown onto another island called 'Utopia'. Here an all-new Robinson adventure begins for them. And for one of the participants there is even still a chance to get back into the real Robinson game and win 2 million Danish kroners.
