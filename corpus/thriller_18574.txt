Byron Orlok is an old horror-movie star who feels that he is an anachronism. Compared to real-life violence his films are tame. Meanwhile Bobby Thompson goes on a killing spree... Peter Bogdanovich's debut feature is a thinly disguised account of ex-marine Charles Whitman who after murdering his mother and his wife armed himself with a number of rifles and handguns and on a sunny 1966 Texas morning began a shooting spree that killed 14 people and wounded 32 people. Bogdanovich's version tells two stories concurrently about an aging horror-film star who feels that his type of movie monster has become pass√© and the other about a father-hating gun freak who goes on a rampage to get even with his dad by shooting at people from the top of a water tower and then from behind a drive-in movie screen.
