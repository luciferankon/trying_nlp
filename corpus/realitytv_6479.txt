Hosted Katty Kay this exclusive 30 minute presentation will look at the storied history of William and Kate's relationship - from their start at the University of St. Andrews to William's proposal in Kenya. Includes footage from the couple's most recent televised interview one of the few times the public has heard from Kate directly as well as archival BBC footage. It will also look at how the British monarchy has adapted to survive over the last century and explore what the future holds for this beloved couple as they balance their public profile and the demands of Britain's intrusive press with their private personal relationship. In addition to interviews with William and Kate's friends the special will include an interview with the highly respected historian and documentarian Professor Simon Schama from Columbia University.
