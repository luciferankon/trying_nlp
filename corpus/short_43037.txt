Phallic is one of several shorts made by San Francisco's experimental super 8 film group The X-Corps. Random subjects are chosen by the filmmakers and then each is assigned to make a 30 second film sharing one roll of Super 8 film (total time 3:20 at 18fps). Based on an old literary experiment "exquisite corpse" was played by several people each of whom would write a phrase on a sheet of paper fold the paper to conceal part of it and pass it on to the next player for his contribution. The X-Corps translate this idea by shooting a 30 second film then passing it off to the next filmmaker without sharing any knowledge of what the previous filmmaker had done. The last person to finish out the film roll was to have it developed and then meet with the rest of the X-Corps (along with their rolls) and all see the films together for the first time.
