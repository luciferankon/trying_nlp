A group of college students decide to end the summer by going camping in the woods near the small town of Cedar Cove. While there they encounter a crazy hermit who warns them about strange experiments with dead bodies being conducted by a demented scientist in an isolated lab nearby. The campers snoop around and are noticed by Dr. Letum's treacherous assistant and that night are besieged by zombies. Separated in the attack the campers must try to escape the risen dead and survive the nightmare they have stumbled into as they deal with the ramifications of science delving into realms into which it was never meant to go. But is Dr. Letum the true evil or is Max Vendo his assistant the real mastermind behind these terrifying events? The truth will unfold as the campers are slaughtered in turn by the resurrected dead. Will any of them survive long enough to learn the truth? Will any of them survive at all?
