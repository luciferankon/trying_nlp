Significant Others is an improvised comedy about couples in and out of marriage counseling taking a hysterically honest look at marriage and the rewards - and costs - that come with being in a committed relationship. More real than traditional comedies and more imaginative than reality shows this six-episode series features a talented ensemble of actors and comedians who quite literally script themselves.
