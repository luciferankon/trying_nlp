Villagers Paul and Davie Nance would be perfectly happy except for four consecutive miscarriages. She transfers her nursing side to Baptist parish volunteer work. Thus she cares for grumpy sickly infidel old neighbor Olin Arrendal better than the registered nurse. Grateful he makes her meet his cheeky stray-Methodist grandson Clay who moved in to get to know his grandfather. Davie soon finds Clay's knavish charm irresistible he's amused she 'stalks' him. Then things turn.
