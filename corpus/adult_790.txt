An empty house which is for sale becomes the opening scene of one of the worst miss-matched sex scenes in history mainly because of Vince Thomas who was up all night before this movie was shot doing drugs at a pool party orgy he looked completely out of touch with his surrounding reality and trying to match him up with blonde bottom Shadow Joyce was a big mistake this movie is terrible.
