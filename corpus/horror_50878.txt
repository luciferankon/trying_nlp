Dr. David Stone is a scientist with a special interest in legends about the Okaloosa wilderness where a violent man-like beast is said to dwell and where many campers have disappeared over the years. When local moneyman Milton St. John offers to fund an expedition to look for the monster Stone readily accepts not realizing that St. John's son was one of those missing campers and that his financier is not interested in science but in getting revenge on the beast!
