This documentary special features stories from people diagnosed with the disease and explores its grave impact on the victims and their families such as Blanchette Hooker Rockefeller mother of Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) who died of complications from Alzheimer's in 1992. Never before has a documentary sought to unveil "what it feels like" to have the disease. Equally important this original program uncovers some of the latest findings in the search for answers and a cure. Highlights include the groundbreaking work underway at BRNI. Scientists there believe they have discovered a biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer's and are especially excited about a test drug that appears to have the remarkable power to not only treat damaged neurons but regenerate growth.
