Thirty thousand billion trillion years in the future. The universe is now a corrupted and hellish place. The mutated spawn of a million alien species have consumed all that was once good. Now in a world where the werewolf lords of Karmaggis battle the androids of Sibelius prime where the mutanoid slavers of Astrogar plunder and the Drakovian rape tribes pillage; heroes are but a lost ideal. Yet in this cosmic hell of metal and magic of future and fantasy a new breed of warriors arise. Ruthless and inhumane restless and unstoppable. They are the only good guys worse than the bad guys. They are Starbarians.
