A leggy red-haired detective pursues a notorious criminal adept at changing her appearance and frequently winds up bound and gagged while the glamorous villainess makes her escape. In a vignette the actress playing a damsel in distress is left trussed and silenced by the mischievous crew when the production has wrapped for the day. In another tale set during World War II an Axis femme fatale captures a costumed heroine only to lose her victim to an even viler villain.
