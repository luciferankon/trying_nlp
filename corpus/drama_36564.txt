A poor and handsome Bulgarian falls for women who only exploit him. Itso about 35 drives a special ambulance called a 'corpse-van'. His job is to pick up the bodies of the recently deceased and transport them to the morgue. Itso's assistant is a Gypsy with the nickname 'Buddy'. Mimi a nice and lovable ward-maid from the morgue likes Itso but he doesn't really pay much attention to her because he is in love with Katya an attractive 40 years old woman. Katya humiliates Itso and uses him but it doesn't change his feelings for her. His attitude can only be explained by the way his mother used to treat him - with care but also with sadism at times. Katya turns out to be a mistress of the mafia boss Rocco who beats her and one of the days - brutally rapes her which is seen by Itso. Buddy convinces Itso that real men deal with life problems by administering justice themselves. Itso decides to rescue Katya and her 14-year old son Mario from Rocco and free the world from a villain... This complex story referring to subconscious psychology and symbolism is not only about freeing the world from outside evil but also freeing a man from inside demons...
