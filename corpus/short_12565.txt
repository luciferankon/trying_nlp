This short documentary is about Cedric Wentworth a sculptor whose contemporary fine art work can rival any popular media art form. The film shows the process of Cedric's work as well as people involved in his art process. The film shows how a classical art form can reflect today's society and show how caged people think. The film explores the contrast between classical steel figures based on abstract plates or boxed in industrial steel boxes. The film represents the opinion of people what they see what attracts them what shocks them and why are they moved by looking at the sculptures. Pop art has a much easier task for success because of it's exposure and media access while fine art is limited to be seen in galleries and museums. Cedric's work is relevant to people who often aren't used to look at art because he takes his art out into the nature and shows it in unusual locations like a shopping mal.
