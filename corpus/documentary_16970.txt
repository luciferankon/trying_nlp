Real Access is produced by the makers of the popular television tabloid Access Hollywood. The show is basically the 'tween/teen version of its parent program airing on the young adult network "The N" within the United States and focusing on young actors singers and entertainers that appeal to the aforementioned age group (e.g. Britney Spears Hilary Duff Orlando Bloom etc.). In addition the show also is a promotional vehicle for its own network's programming occasionally profiling actors from its own shows (e.g. Degrassi Radio Free Roscoe etc.). Mostly relying on archived interviews and newsclips former aspiring pop star and host Lauren C. Mayhew occasionally has the opportunity to interview the show's subjects. Overall Real Access is a well-done entertainment show and while it may not get overly-explicit due to the age of its primary viewership it manages to be unique informative and entertaining and is very responsive to comments made and polls taken by its viewers at The N's website.
