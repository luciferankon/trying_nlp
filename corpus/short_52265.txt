Who said that the unemployed were lazybones? Just look at Christophe Aumont a nice young man who happens not to have landed a job: well his life could not be busier and ... more stressful. From dawn to dusk there is not a dull moment for the poor guy : filling in forms opening rejection letters calling up potential employers waiting for the phone call of a future employer trying to get rid of Jehovah's Witnesses soothing his mother on the phone. What a life! At long last midnight comes and Christophe collapses into bed exhausted for a short night's sleep. Before starting all over again the next day.
