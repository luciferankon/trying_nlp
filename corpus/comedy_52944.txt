The story is pretty simple: five youths spend together all the time they can. Laura is a rational and misunderstood girl who plays in an also misunderstood band. Lucas is a seducer and a compulsive liar. Fernando suffers from chronic insomnia and is capable of saying the most outrageous things with a poker face. Murdock does not say a word and never changes clothes. Anna is a good-hearted girl who lives to please the others. They are as someone points out during the movie "a not very representative group". Days follow one another without apparent difference. Our heroes always do the same: Fridays at the park Saturdays to the bar Mondays to the pub. Without fail they get drunk and without fail they forget what is it that they did the previous night but they don't mind they'd rather not know. This idyllic self-destructing atmosphere vanishes when Anna announces her departure. To make things worse she's leaving with an abominable presumptuous and vain individual: The Ninny. The rest of the group is torn between making life impossible for the Ninny trying anything to make Anna stay and tour for the last time the places where they've always been together. Because they only have one week. This is the week we live together us and them.
