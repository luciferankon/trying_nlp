One of the things I was most struck by when moving to Los Angeles from rural Vermont was how many very large newly constructed buildings there are in LA for the express purpose of storing things that we value but for some reason don't keep in our homes. Even though I am a bi-coastal storer myself I was set to wonder why is there a storage complex on every corner. What is everyone hanging on to? Is this just an American thing? Who are the people powering this industry? And is it worth it? My Dad owns a small set of units. And from those 26 he grosses about $3000 monthly in passive income. So if he's realizing this on a small scale what's going on with these very large companies that can have 1500 units in a single building? The structures in the cities are truly complexes. They seem to have all the comforts of home - electricity piped-in music air conditioning and at about $1.60 per square foot it's not all that surprising that people have taken to living in them. Speaking of complexes everything I try to get rid of something I hear myself saying "But it's still good" or "I'll need it as soon as I get rid of it "I might wear that." "It was a gift." And the ever popular "But it's my stuff!" I wanted to know if other people felt this way about their stuff too. BOXES is a quirky and compelling portrait of our connection to our stuff. We roll up the doors and rummage through the storage units of a wide-cross section of Americans to discover what is so important that we'll pay to keep it just not in our homes.
