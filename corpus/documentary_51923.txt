A 160-kilometer long historic river named 'Kali Bein' which has been associated with the socio-cultural-economic life of the people of Punjab since ancient times falls prey to industrialization urbanization and turns into dirtiest garbage bin. With the passage of time the stream vanishes and river finally dies. The consequences are terrible. People suffer for years and are then motivated by a saint to revive the river.
