Behind the walls of max-security Green Haven Correctional Facility documentary filmmaker Ryan Katzenbach interviews Ronald J. "Butch" DeFeo Jr. DeFeo was convicted in 1975 of murdering his whole family which spawned the "Amityville Horror" haunted house fraud. The story was the subject of Katzenbach's 2011-2014 trilogy series on the case "Shattered Hopes: The True Story of the Amityville Murders." In June 2014 Katzenbach interviewed DeFeo firsthand to ask questions about "The Amityville Horror" his family and the murders that took place four decades ago. This is the first time that an interview has been presented to the public that is uncut and uncensored.
