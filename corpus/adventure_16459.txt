Aron Ralston is arguably the most famous survivor in the world. His ordeal in a Utah canyon where he had to cut off his own arm after getting trapped was made into the Oscar nominated film '127 Hours'. Now he's spending another 127 hours as a castaway on a desert island. The story of his struggle to survive in the canyon merges with his desert island experience as he starts to suffer debilitating dehydration and tells how in the canyon he had to drink his own urine. In an emotional fireside climax on his fifth night he remembers how the vision of his yet unborn son gave him the strength to amputate his arm and how then as now thoughts of his family sustained him through bleak moments.
