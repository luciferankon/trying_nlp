What started off as a side-gig for a middle-aged single mother to make a little extra cash ignited into a full-time gig for a trio of talented women. "Hot Flash" introduces the world (outside of those blues purists) to a unique and inspiring group of musicians named Saffire-The Uppity Blues Women. They offer a raw but universal view you can only get from women who have lived...really lived - and can sing shout and laugh about life.
