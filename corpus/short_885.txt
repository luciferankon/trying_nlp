My grandfather paints landscapes that no longer exist because they have disappeared under touristic buildings. On Summer 2008 I came back to Menorca the island where I was born. I wanted to shoot my grandfather his paintings and his landscapes. The result: a touristic drama with hotel at the bottom.
