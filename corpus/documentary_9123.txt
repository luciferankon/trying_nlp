In this epic 15 part series Cambridge art historian Paul Binski makes a journey through the history of English religious art and architecture. Dr. Binski's story takes us from the Norman invasion of England and the building of the first great Romanesque cathedrals through the great age of Renaissance Wren and beyond. But this is more than a history of Britain's religious art and architecture - it is an exploration of religious belief. And it is also a history of Britain because for Paul Binski these elements are part of the same glorious story. Told over 15 half hour programmes Binski visits some of the most extraordinary religious buildings in Britain.
