Britain - safe secure manicured ordered. This is the Britain we know our gardens planted bordered and clipped. Our lawns neatly mowed our countryside managed tamed trimmed and taken care of. Our animals domesticated and those that are still wild small and harmless. But all is not well in our green and pleasant land. There have been whispers and rumors. Something has crept back into the woods and made them wild again. Something ancient and powerful not seen for hundreds of years. Something that may even be dangerous. Human activity has played an integral part in shaping the ecology of the British Isles. It was man who hunted and bred the wild boar to extinction hundreds of years ago and it has also been man who has inadvertently helped bring boar back. With no current Government legislation in place to control the growing numbers of this potentially dangerous wild animal and with such divided opinion amongst local communities the jury is still out upon the wild boars future in the UK. With unique footage of wild boar thriving in British woodlands and extensive interviews with both leading British ecologists zoologists and local communities 'Wild Boar - Return of the Prodigal Pig' tells the fascinating story of the rise and fall and recent resurgence of Britain's most dangerous wild animal.
