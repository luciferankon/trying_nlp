Britain is under siege from scammers who are using technology to rob us blind. They might not use a crowbar or wear a balaclava to break into our homes or steal our lives but scamming is the "new" burglary and it is out of control. Increasingly crime in the UK involves some form of cyber criminal and the Government is secretly putting millions of pounds into new specialist cyber cop units to identify and catch these 21st century crooks. Scamming now costs the UK economy at least Ł27 billion a year - and that's just the reported crimes. This film investigates the problem and reveals some of the heart-rending stories of victims who've fallen foul of the scammers. Including a woman who fell for a romance scam which cost her Ł180000 and a teenager who committed suicide after being scammed by a crook pretending to be the police.
