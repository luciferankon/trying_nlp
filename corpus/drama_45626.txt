Abu and Aisumma are an aging Muslim couple. Their aspiration is to go for Hajj and they make many sacrifices to achieve this aim. Now in their late 70s they decide that they will go for Hajj that year. Abu being a true Muslim wants to go for Hajj only according to all diktats of Islam. Good-natured people try to help him by loaning the amount but since this is against the accepted practices of the religion he refuses to take them. Finally they are not able to go. On the dawn of the Hajj Abu tells his wife that they will go the next year. He goes to the mosque to pray on the Hajj morning.
