Nick Broomfield met Hsiao Hung Pai a journalist who was working for the Guardian when making his feature film 'Ghosts' (about the Morecambe Bay Chinese Cockle Pickers ). As an experiment and using the latest in undercover technology Nick worked with Hsiao to make a Undercover film set in a Chinese brothel in Finchley. There are over 2000 'illegal' brothels in Londonlargely ignored by the police and the authorities which employ 80% foreign nationals mostly illegal that are easily exploited by the brothel owners. The film has a very different feel from the normal undercover film. This is due to the camera being mounted in the center of spectacles which causes the participants to look directly into the camera achieving a great intimacy and the possibility of making a character lead undercover film. This is also a very subjective story told through the eyes of Hsiao Hung Pai an immigrant herself who though a very experienced undercover reporter went through great personal trauma revisiting this territory.
