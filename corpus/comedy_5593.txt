Over-the-hill TV actress Joyce Whitman is the star of a bad network crime drama "Undercover Woman". Acting in such an awful series is bad enough; being directed by her acerbic ex-husband John is even worse. Her roommate is a dizzy blonde named Mitzi and she's frequently forced to deal with fussbudget network executive Doug.
