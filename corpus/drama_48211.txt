Complete Unknowns is about a couple of loners who couldn't find a place in society and struggling with everyday life only to find themselves in a strange place at the end of the film. Stick and Pinkie have been friends since they could talk growing up in small town America going to school together and are trying to find a way out of small town America to bigger and better things.
