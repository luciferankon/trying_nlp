" Over the years I have received literally thousands of letters from readers of my books from all over the world. The same phrase has recurred; I wish I could see the places you write about - if this film can reach those people then it will give them a glimpse of the countryside where I have found so many of the good things of life. The scenes and photography are exquisite and Chris's commentary and appearance superb. The film was a constant joy to watch
