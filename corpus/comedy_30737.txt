The comedic tale of local musician Toe's struggle to put together a tour for his band. Through selling dirt weed stabbing people in the back and double-crossing half a dozen of the meanest sons of bitches in Texas Toe puts himself in a position to achieve his dreams. Toe is the frontman for the rock band Pigpoke. He's also a dreamer. He dreams of the ultimate road trip for the band a trip that would validate that Pigpoke has arrived. But who will fund the trip and how? Rather than wait Toe takes matters into his own hands and proceeds to raise funds by becoming a weed supplier to the common rock lovin' slackin' and just plain down-and-out denizens he knows. Unfortunately for him the road to touring salvation is winding and bumpy and pretty soon getting out of town becomes not just an option but a necessity if Toe and his gang wish to stay alive long enough to play another day.
