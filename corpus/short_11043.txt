For a long time let us say since the Renaissance the West has looked on its world through one eye making the synaesthetic multidimensional experience of sight into vision. It is what Donna Haraway calls a "god trick". Elahe Massumi opens both eyes and sees the ghost. In her work which is not one there are no singulars. On two screens words images and colours flicker and fade. The Western eye cannot absorb it. She relents and offers us the chance to see screen by screen. Yet as in a Mandelbrot set descending one level does not simplify but adds further complexity even as there is understanding.
