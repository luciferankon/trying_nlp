The Great Granny Revolution is about the bonds of friendship between women and the power of individuals to make a difference. The Wakefield Grannies 12 Canadian women offer moral and financial support to a group of Gogos (grandmothers) raising AIDS-orphaned grandchildren in South Africa's Alexandra Township. With his partner Brenda - a founding member of the Wakefield Grannies - filmmaker Robert Rooney documents the group's growth as they inspire their community and others to follow their example. Meanwhile the simple knowledge that women on the other side of the world care about them brings hope to the Gogos and invigorates their efforts.
