From the Inside Looking Out is the tale of one man's will to change his old thought process. Though tempted by his past he refuses to fall victim to the very thinking that once hindered his personal growth. Bound by a new moral and value system he is forced to reckon with obstacles and adversity as he collides with an old friend. Now more than ever his choice becomes paramount as he must decide if he will do the "hard right" over the "easy wrong" with the understanding that whatever choice he makes will shape the community that he was once part of.
