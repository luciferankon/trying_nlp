Israeli detective commissioners Jakoov Blok and Sara Stein investigate an explosion at the Biblical anti-Roman rebellion fort Masada dig which killed maverick archaeologist Aaron Salzman son and plausible successor of amnesiac-blasted Warshaw ghetto uprising survivor Avram Salzman nationally celebrated by Zionist for discovering Masada. Aaron's young assistant Philippe a France-raised Iranian Jew is beaten up by thugs to keep the flow going of stolen artifacts provided by Aaron who believed to disprove the Masada mass suicide but is in for worse. Aaron's orthodox brother Elia is suspected of facilitating the contraband trade. But another Salzmann trauma proves relevant.
