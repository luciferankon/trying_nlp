A tough homeless man is jealous of the businesses and homes that he often begs and scrounges outside of. When the owner of a struggling caf√© makes a deal with him though to clean and dress-up and sit and eat in the window of her store (to make it look busier and pleasant) he realizes that everyone has their own problems. As the two help each other and bond they both realize they have much to offer others and much to be thankful for.
