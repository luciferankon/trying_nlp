The federal government passes the Gun Violence in America Act which mandates that anyone wishing to possess or who is caught carrying a firearm of any kind is relocated to the National Firearm Zone a massive walled city in the deserts of New Mexico. This area is now the only place in the country where firearms can be used. The rule is simple: Once you enter the NFZ you - and future generations of your family - never can leave. Locals call it Guntown.
