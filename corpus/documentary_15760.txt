Hitler's Atlantic Wall tells the exciting story of the German Atlantic line of defense during the Second World War. On Hitler's orders hundreds of thousands of people have built a gigantic wall of bunkers cannons and fortifications from the north of Norway to the Pyreneans some 4500 kilometers long. A megalomaniac project and a painful memory of a sombre episode in Western history. Hitler's Atlantic Wall is a testimony to brilliancy but also the lust for power and the madness of the Nazi thinkers and strategists. But this is also a story of those who lived worked fought and often died there.
