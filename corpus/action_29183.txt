Genji Nakamura and his soul-mate and partner Michiko Nishiwaki are thieves for the notorious Red Army terrorist organization in Japan. After pulling off the jewelry heist of the century (in which dozens of people get killed including a Tokyo detective) they are now planning to use the jewelry they've snatched to buy an arms cache from gun smugglers in Hong Kong for their movement. But when the duo learns the jewelry is fake and that their co-conspirator has set them up they are determined to get what is owed to them even if they have to tear Hong Kong inside out. But lovely Hong Kong inspector Rachel Yeung is on the scene and she's not having any kind of bloodbath on her watch. After recently being promoted to 'Madam' for the S.C.S. (Serious Crimes Section) Rachel is determined to bust Michiko and Nakamura anyway she can when their violence results in too many casualties. But Rachel finds herself at odds with her bumbling uncle Cameron Chung the head inspector for the S.C.S. as he feels this case is too dangerous for her and assigns Rachel to be a police escort for Officer Fujioka a quiet but determined Tokyo police officer who is in town for his own personal reasons...reasons which could spell trouble for Rachel when she learns that he has a personal vendetta against Michiko and Nakamura. As the action hits overdrive filled with chases gun fights and some serious hand-to-hand combat from both sides it leads to a brutal but nasty showdown pitting cop against criminal...and only those with something to lose may be the ones to walk away from this encounter alive.
