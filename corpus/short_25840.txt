This is another bogus title emerging from the error-prone pages of Richard E. Braff's Silent Short Film Working Papers; it is not the same film as A Counterfeit Santa Claus (1912/I) which features a different cast and there is no reliable documentation that the listed players Bosworth Cox Daniels and Leighton ever appeared together in a film bearing this title at this time. It is probable that the film was announced but either never completed or else completed but never released.
