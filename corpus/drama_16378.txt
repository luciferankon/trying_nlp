A prime-time version of the popular daytime show "Day in Court." America's fascination with what goes on inside the courtroom goes back way before Court TV and The People's Court were on the air. This program provided viewers with as realistic a look as possible at how real trials are conducted and decided. Re-enactments of actual cases were used with real attourneys making their arguments in front of real judges. Only the defendants and witnesses were actors.
