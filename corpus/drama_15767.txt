On the same day in the same accident Wei loses his pregnant wife and Ming her fianc√©. In Buddhism one is given 100 days to mourn for the dead. Like two mice lost in a labyrinth Wei runs around in circles while Ming calmly creeps down a determined path. But the pain and sorrow linger on. With the 100th day approaching they wonder if they'll ever be able to say goodbye.
