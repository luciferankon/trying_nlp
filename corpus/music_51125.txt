On March 21st 2016 a few weeks prior to the release of the Santana IV album this classic line-up of Santana took to the stage at the House Of Blues in Las Vegas. This was a hugely anticipated reunion of a line-up that had not performed and recorded together since the early seventies. It brought back the scintillating combination of rock Latin blues jazz and African rhythms which was the band's trademark and made them truly unique.
