The elderly as a percentage of the population has increased four times in the last hundred years. We are now facing a silver tsunami of an aging population. The Wenatchee Guardians are guardians of the aging and dying in Wenatchee Washington State. Many under their care are alone without family and die alone and without family. This film looks at dying dementia and aging and wonders about what may happen to all of us someday sometime. Wenatchee was chosen as a location for this film but dying alone and without family is an issue without borders.
