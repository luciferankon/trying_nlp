In this follow up to _The Time Machine (1960)_ (qv) Filby is still the caretaker of his friend George's house seventeen years following George's trip to the future. Filby is then surprised to see his old friend return to his home to retrieve some books to help in his quest to rebuild humanity. During the stay Filby implores his good friend to stay and resume his life there. However George refuses and tells James that he has chosen to remain in the future. Also it is a sad return for George due to the fact that at the time he returns it is just prior to the beginning of World War I and he does all he can to try to not reveal the tragic future of his good friend.
