Reconcile then tell the story of someone who left your father and tell it through the voices of people you've never met before the only ones who know make the separation visible by opening the door of the father's house then reconcile. The film walks across genres as we humans do: documentary performance landscapes all come together to tell the story of a man a father whose daughter has lost memory of. The film revolves around the absence of memory the collapse of the private space the sharing of intimacy or better the collective sphere that narrates the intimacy. The film does this without filters; the camera is hidden as it has to collect thoughts and public perceptions for a daughter who doesn't have memories of her father. Along these interviews where the camera stays uncontrolled and optional there are sequences of the space - Taormina - landscapes that tell the sense of non-belonging and distance from a city closed and ill-inclined to sharing as well as sequences inside the father's house: the sweet home.
