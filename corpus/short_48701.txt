Almost a tone poem this is a collage of sounds and images: gay Black men dance sing and recite poetry. They call each other to arms to parade and flaunt their race and sexual orientation. They call on each other to rewrite history to pervert the language to "be freaky and free" and to confront America in order to redefine it in a way that gives them standing as equals.
