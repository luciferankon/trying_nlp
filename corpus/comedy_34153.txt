In this wacky comedy teen-aged Tony (Bentley C. Mitchum) has never known who is father is. Together with his best buddies Peter and Susan he tracks down the clues he has as well as he can. Meanwhile the twin brother of a Spanish priest has set out from where he lives in order to find his son whom he has never met. (The priest and his twin are played by Christopher Mitchum.) The two search parties meet in the village where the priest lives giving rise to all sorts of misunderstandings - for instance that the priest was the father and not his twin brother whose existence no one else knows about. This leads to all sorts of trouble for the priest from his diocesesan bishop (Ernest Borgnine) and other priests.
