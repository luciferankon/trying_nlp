Sent to investigate a payroll robbery Marshall Rocky meets his old friends Ken Eddie and Max. He has the serial numbers and when Pop puts on his medicine show they get one of the bills. This enables Ken to see through Sorrell's scheme that threw the blame on an innocent rancher and he sets out to prove it. In a modified swipe/remake of John Waynes "Paradise Canyon" U.S. Marshal Taylor appoints Rocky Camron a Marshal with the task of solving a $100000 bank robbery. Camron enlists the aid of his friends Ken Maynard Eddie DEan and Max Terhune. "Doc" Martin and his daughter Ann are fleeing a nearby town in a hurry as some of the local citizens are somewhat incensed regarding the imitation elixir sold them by Martin. Their medicine-show jalopy breaks down near the state line with a sheriff's posse in hot pursuit. Maynard happens along and tows their vehicle over the state line with his white stallion Tarzan. An ambush attempt is made on Maynard's life as the bank robbers aware of the coming of a Marshal mistake Maynard for Camron because of the identical white stallions ridden by both. Maynard Dean and Terhune  posing as performers with Martin's traveling medicine show hunt for the bandits.
