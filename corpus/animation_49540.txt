Axel the truck is in awe of Mike's aerobatic abilities and wishes he could fly like that. Mike can't blame Axel's hero worship - after all what's good about being stuck on the ground like a truck? But when MIke shows off a little too much he clips his wing and ends up grounded just like Axel. Only by driving a mile in Axel's tires does Mike gain an appreciation for a truck's lifestyle while at the same time helping Axel realize his own unique capabilities. In appreciation Mike then makes it his mission to give Axel the same experience.
