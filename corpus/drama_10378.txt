The couch at Andy Warhol's Factory was as famous in its own right as any of his Superstars. In Couch visitors to the Factory were invited to "perform" on camera seated on the old couch. Their many acts-both lascivious and mundane-are documented in a film that has come to be regarded as one of the most notorious of Warhol's early works. Across the course of the film we encounter such figures as poets Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso the writer Jack Kerouac and perennial New York figure Taylor Mead.
