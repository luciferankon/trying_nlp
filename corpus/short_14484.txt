Black women and women of color alike have often been at the end of verbal attacks. They are often looked down upon and even discouraged from wearing their natural hair and curls. 'What are you gonna do with that hair once you have to get a job?' or 'Wear it like that while you are young and still can' are sentences that they know well. They have been advised to straighten their hair and use relaxers to 'tame' the hair that naturally grows out of their heads. A woman's hair has often been more esteemed than who she was as a person. Their natural hair had been deemed as 'messy' 'unprofessional' and even 'disgusting'. This really bothered me and I could recall seeing the affects of this issue as a child. I have seen countless women that I love and know to be beautiful mothers sisters daughters wrestle with finding and maintaining a sense of self worth. This project was crafted to bring light and love to the issue. It attempts to widen our concept of success and beauty. Women of color have kept silent in the work place and at large in fear of loosing jobs and opportunities. I hope that this project opens all of our minds to be more aware of the world around us and allow us to celebrate and appreciate different cultures as opposed to try to make them fit the majority.
