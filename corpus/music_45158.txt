Filmed in June of 2010 in the intimate surroundings of New York's famous Roseland Ballroom this is a real chance to get up close and personal as Phil Collins faithfully recreates the soul and Motown classics that he loved as a teenager. His band includes three of Motown's original backing band The Funk Brothers: Bob Babbitt on bass and guitarists Eddie Willis and Ray Monette as well as two stalwarts of Genesis' live shows: Chester Thompson on drums and Darryl Stuermer on guitars.
