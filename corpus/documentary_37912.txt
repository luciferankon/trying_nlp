Shot in Toronto Badge of Pride takes a look at how queer cops in Canada's largest police force deal with being gay in a profession that has traditionally been perceived as anti-gay. Four gay cops speak out. For each being gay has shaped their professional paths - whether they'd like to admit it or not. Two veterans a rookie and a copper who was so harassed on the job that he had to find refuge at a desk job. The stories provide a candid and unflinching look at the lives of gay cops. Featured are: Constable Jackie O'Keefe (43) a ten year veteran of the Toronto Police Force who entered policing after spending a decade as a lesbian activist; Sergeant Judy Nosworthy (48) a twenty two year veteran who is the country's first out Lesbian cop and the highest-ranking LGBT cop in Canada; Constable Todd Hillhouse (45) a nineteen year veteran who was hounded out of street patrols and into a desk job by homophobes in his division and Constable Paul Regan a rookie whose just joined the service and is openly gay in his division. Badge of Pride is a documentary that looks at the lives of gay cops; cops who are out cops who are closeted and cops who are somewhere in between the closet and the cruiser. Over the course of one year starting and ending with the Gay Pride Parade the documentary will survey how much the landscape has changed and look at the different challenges gay cops face - along gender race and class lines. Coming out as a gay cop has its price. Badge of Pride will ask: "Will the force be with you if you're gay?"
