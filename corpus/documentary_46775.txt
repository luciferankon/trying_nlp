Memories of a dreamer is a first hand account of the hardship suffered by a political prisoner of Chile's cruel 1973 and inhumane dictatorship. More than 30 years after Félix Mora relives the shocking details of the human rights abuses he suffered his escape from the dictatorship and the challenges he faced as an exile in Italy and Canada. Félix's heartbreaking memories are shared with Jorge Aro another political prisoner and friend of Félix who was also held in the Stadium at the horrifyingly tender age of 15. Together they share chilling details of their incarceration re-visiting the "snail shell" where the most gruesome tortures took place. The site closed down after our filming. Exile was meant to silence those who fought the regime. For Félix exile became a catalyst to fight for freedom and democracy. Escaping to Italy first he then settled in Canada and resumed the struggle for freedom in his country. Through this journey Félix looks for the answer to the struggle that has been his life: Can he ever repatriate to his birthplace and belong to Chile again or has this experience changed him to a point of no return? Archival footage dramatization and personal narratives bring to light an emotionally jolting and inspirational film where terror and injustice are overcome by courage and determination. The film also challenges the assumption that refugees cannot participate in their homeland's struggles from abroad and still build successful lives in their adopted countries. It is also a testament to the lives of many Chilean exiles.
