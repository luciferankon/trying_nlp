Tex Mason and Peggy Turner each inherit one half of the Triple X Ranch. Thomas wants the ranch and he has Triple X hand Joe let his men rustle their cattle. Tex not only has to fight the rustlers he must also contend with Easterner Peggy's idea of what a ranch should be. Rustlers are making off with the cattle at the Triple X ranch and foreman Tex Mason fears he may get a phone call from absentee owner Jim Turner that he is fired. But the phone call from Chicago is to inform Tex that Jim Turner has died and left half-ownership of the ranch to him and the other half to Turners' daughter Peggy. Unknown to Tex the rustling is part of a plan by John Thomas president of the Redstaff County Bank to force the ranch into bankruptcy so he can take over. To this end he has enlisted the aid of a Triple X cowhand named Joe. Tex and Peggy immediately disagree on any point regarding the ranch especially when she makes plans to turn it into a dude ranch and Tex replies that the ranch is part of a "man's land" that doesn't tolerate dudes or by implication women. Thomas comes sneaking around and tells Peggy of an offer he had made to her father to buy the ranch and he wouldn't be a bit surprised to find out that Tex in his own interests was behind the rustling. Then Thomas and Joe use a missing horseshoe on Tex's horse to further implicate Tex as one of the rustlers. And they have one more master plan afoot to get rid of Tex.
