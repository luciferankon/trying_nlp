Attrition the action or process of gradually reducing the strength or effectiveness of someone or something through sustained attack or pressure. Attrition is a different kind of experimental documentary perhaps one of the simplest forms and therefore one that has become lost in the eyes of the mass media. It's a film that is in the true sense a pure document a visual recording of the life of one being during the period of a year. With no speech the viewer is left to truly engage with this human interest. Attrition is a film that captures time itself. A collection of thousands of photographs taken each day in 2005 the result is a breathtaking high speed journey of frailty and emotion.
