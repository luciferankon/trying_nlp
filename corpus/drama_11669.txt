Beginning with a black screen a voice describes the life of Brother Andr√© born Alfred Bessette in 1845 and how he became a famous miracle healer and saint in Quebec and the founder of St. Joseph's Oratory in Montreal. Then one by one 5 seemingly unrelated characters in the present time are introduced living their ordinary daily lives without dramatization. Throughout the film between the introduction of each character the same young woman is shown doing housework and packing her clothes into a suitcase. It is eventually revealed that the woman is Isabelle and the other characters are her mother father and 3 brothers. She is the center point of the film and brings the other 5 characters together.
