Dedicated Dutch graphic designer Piet Schreuders visits Los Angeles to investigate all kinds of typeface as used in title-credits for movies and TV-series letters on billboards shop-windows or street-signs the banner-headlines of The Los Angeles Times and climbs finally to the giant letters of the HOLLYWOOD-sign. In the meantime he discovers to his great satisfaction the location and stairs where Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy shot their movie 'The Musicbox' by combining street-signs partially shown on still-pictures of this movie: "...MONTE" and "...ENDOME" which turn out to be found on the streetcorner of Del Monte and Vendome in Culver City. This documentary is bluntly intercut with commercials a phenomenon not yet known in the Netherlands in 1979.
