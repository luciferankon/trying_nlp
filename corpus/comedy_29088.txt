The Duchamps School of Acting follows Jonathan Duchamps and his class of dedicated acting students as they work to develop their talents and master Jonathan's technique. Eccentric and passionate Jonathan's approach to his craft is by turns intense and ridiculous. The documentary explores the relationships between teacher to student and artist to mentor. How far will someone go for what they love... what wouldn't you do to achieve your dreams?
