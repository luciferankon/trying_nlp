Geitzler's Asylum - Eight paranormal investigators are invited to do a taped-live show. Little do they know that a murder took place just days prior to their arrival inside the very place they will be investigating and another murder on the grounds of the asylum. One-by-one these investigators are killed by spectral hands or are they being dispatched by human hands? This film is presently being shot in and about the St. Louis Mo Metro area. The release date is tentatively fall 2012 and will be entered into various film festivals.
