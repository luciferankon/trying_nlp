Jess is happy. She loves her job has a brilliant group of friends and earns enough to be able to have a laugh and go on holiday occasionally. But she's at a point now where she'd just love to share that with someone else. She knows who she is and what she wants and isn't happy to settle. She's seen the Woody Allen films and wants true love. Someone who makes her stomach flip. Someone who laughs at her jokes. Someone who's kind and and fabulous in bed. Too much to ask for? She thinks not. She's a good catch it's just a matter of timing right?
