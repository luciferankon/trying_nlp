In a modest workshop in a remote Central Otago landscape Swiss goldsmith Kobi Bosshard now approaching eighty and regarded as the grandfather of contemporary New Zealand jewellery continues to produce works characterised by a simplicity and timelessness treasured by the thousands who wear them. "The work we do comes out of the life we live" he tells his apprentice "so we have to have a life to start with." Through the eyes of his daughter filmmaker Andrea Bosshard we watch Kobi in his lifelong commitment to the daily practice of his craft. Trusting in the ability of his hands he moves through life without hurry immersing himself in the everyday rhythms around family and work. Including old Super 8 home movies archival footage and family letters this very personal film is both a meditation on growing up and growing old and a glimpse into the humour and warmth of this father/daughter relationship.
