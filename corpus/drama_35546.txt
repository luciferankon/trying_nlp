Here Am I is set sometime in the 19th century. A horseman rides through the burning ruins of a village that he has just destroyed in search of a sacred text - a text his banished clan was forbidden to see because they were told they could not bear the purity of its meaning. From the devastation emerges a ten-year-old boy and Mute giant. Fearing the horseman both survivors head for the river for safety. During this perilous journey the boy not only has to deal with his companion's bizarre behavior but also the truth that he is the guardian of the life-altering sacred text.
