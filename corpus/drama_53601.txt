A farm widow who has been impoverished by the siphoning of her water supply. A nearby big-city aqueduct has priority over water rights leaving the rural outskirts virtually dry. Attempting to bring her cause to the forefront McGuire dynamites the reservoir half-hoping that she'll be "martyred" in the process. When she fails to arouse public support she targets the local power plant for her next blast. Assistant DA Victoria Racimo who as an orphaned Indian girl had been virtually raised by McGuire decides to challenge the water-department bureaucracy on McGuire's behalf.
