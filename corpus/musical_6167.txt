The Music Hall Entertainment Champagne Charlie was created for Christopher Beeching by the playwright and director Glyn Jones. This performance of the show was filmed in September 2013 at London's historic Wilton's Music Hall. George Leybourne (Champagne Charlie 1842-1884) had a repertoire of over two hundred songs and during the course of the show Christopher Beeching performs twenty-three of them wearing reproductions of Leybourne's costumes. They cover a range of characters: from a rowdy upper class yob to a heartbroken lover a bold fisherman a boxer a Chinese giant and a wealthy champagne drinking swell. Leybourne's beginnings in the slums of Gateshead are graphically described as well as the hardship of a life in the Victorian Music Hall; his meteoric rise in the public's eyes only to be deceived by fickle fame ending up exhausted with an early penniless death.
