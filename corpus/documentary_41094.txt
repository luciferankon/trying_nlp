FOOD SYSTEMS Chapter 3: The Ecosystem moves away from restaurants and focuses on farmers. Hidden Hills Dairy makes cheese. Laurel Hill Trout Farm provides a tour of the life cycle of farm trout. Founders of Penn's Corner Farm Alliance relive the early days. Downstream buyers Wigle Whiskey and Millie's Homemade Ice Cream show us their process. In addition to the craft of making different foods and drink the film documents the challenges of farming - impacts from climate change fracking strip mining and skyrocketing land prices to monocultures and their impact on diet and food pricing.
