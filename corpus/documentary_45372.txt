Most American Jews live in large cities where they are free to define themselves in any way they wish. But almost invisible to most of the country are roughly one million Jews scattered across far-flung communities. For them Jewish identity is a daily urgent challenge; if they don't personally uphold their communities and live affirmative Jewish lives they and their legacies could fade away forever. "There Are Jews Here" follows the poignant stories of four once thriving Jewish communities that can now barely hold a prayer service. In Latrobe PA we chronicle the closing of a shul through the intimate story of Mickey Radner who helped keep the synagogue open long enough for the Bat Mitzvah of their oldest member's granddaughter. Out west in Butte we meet the indefatigable Nancy Oyer who tries to maintain the community while struggling with her personal health. In Laredo a young interfaith couple is torn between reviving their community or moving to a thriving one in San Antonio. And in a twist we meet a Los Angeles family who takes up Dothan Alabama's offer of up to $50000 to Jews who relocate to their town.
