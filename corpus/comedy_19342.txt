Who would imagine that gays can be harsh? This film featured a gang composed of gays who was notorious for their illegal works in some popular parks and clubs in Manila. Carding (Leopoldo Salcedo) and Tomas (Ramon Revilla) were tasked to look after this gang by their Chief (Investigation Agency) and the two were asked to dress-up and disguise as real gays. They have to learn a lot of gay stuff and many people misunderstood them. Their glamour and fake charm might be funny and a cause of headache but a key to solve a certain case.
