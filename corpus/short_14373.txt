You let standards fall like that the next that goes is pride. And once you lose pride you might as well be buried because you're a dead man walking. And that's where we're at right now: an entire country of f%@kin' zombies. So says Jimmy -- a career criminal of the 'thinking' sort -- while staring out the windshield of his parked Cadillac thoughtfully munching a hamburger and fries. He lectures an audience of one -- Susie Solomon -- a hapless teenage prostitute who is currently bound blindfolded and gagged in the back seat. After Jimmy's philosophical appetite has been satisfied he begins the long drive to the middle of nowhere to complete the job he was hired to do and deliver Susie to a warehouse and a group of men whose ultimate intentions for the girl remain at least to him a mystery. Once inside Jimmy is commended for his work. He is paid handsomely - nearly twice what he was promised. All is well in Jimmy's world. Another rung ascended on the criminal ladder money in his pocket and the pretty naive girl from Idaho is about to learn a lesson that should swear her off 'hooking' forever. But maybe he suddenly realizes as he studies the 'scenery' around the warehouse they're going to do more than just 'teach her a lesson'. When Jimmy finally learns of her true fate he must make a decision: take the money and run or stay and try to save Susie Solomon? A two-bit criminal is hired to kidnap a working girl from off the streets and deliver her to a warehouse in the middle of nowhere. Exactly what's going to happen to her when he gets her there is a mystery; and when he finally finds out he has second thoughts about completing the job.
