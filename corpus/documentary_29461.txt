Less-usual holiday programme with the BBC's Ben Anderson risking a tour of two of the world's officially failed states. In North Korea he enters a ghost-land unchanged since the ceasefire of 1953 closely monitored by a government tourist-guide who can only speak in propaganda phrases. In Iraq he explores an Islamic country bitterly divided between Sunni and Shia and a fatalistic public just recovering from one long war as they sense the next one coming up.
