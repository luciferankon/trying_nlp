Game show in which four contestants compete to earn money. Five rounds are played beginning with a "money clock" of $1000 and going up to $5000. Rounds are played by each contestant pushing a hidden button locking in a money amount. Some rounds the clock goes up from zero others down from the amount of the round. The contestant who is greediest (locks in the highest amount) gets zero for that round and the others get the amount they locked in. Fifth round eliminates the greediest and most cautious player awarding money to the two contests in the middle of the range. After all rounds the two contestants with the most money over five rounds play for their combines total and the least greedy of them wins the amount they clock in at.
