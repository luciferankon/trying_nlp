Marie Temosach an Indian girl graduates with honors at an eastern college but is not received socially and is glad to return to her old home. She is coveted by Sancho a cattle thief but she rebuffs his advances. Morton Dean a spendthrift is trapped into an engagement with Dora Wendell a society adventuress. His father threatens to disinherit him and dies within a short time leaving one will bequeathing only his mines to Morton and a supplementary will specifying that the rest of his estate should go to Morton after six months. Dora refuses to marry Morton believing him penniless and he goes to Mexico where he and Marie become mutually attracted to each other. Sancho becomes jealous and after being worsted in a fight with Morton swears revenge. Marie warns Morton but he tells her to have no fear. Later Morton is wounded and rescued by Marie who takes him to her cabin. They declare their love and Marie telling Morton that he shall henceforth be "her god" destroys the idol she has previously worshiped. Dora learning that Morton has not been disinherited follows him. She meets Sancho and they go to Marie's cabin. To save Morton Marie paints him to represent the idol and places him on the pedestal. Sancho and Dora not suspecting this ruse search the cabin but cannot find him. Marie forces Morton to go back to the white girl despite his protests. Later haunted by visions of him she rises in the night and goes onward and onward as in a dream until she is in the embrace of the man she loves. Sancho again annoys Marie who proudly shows him her baby. He tells her he is the child's father that the night she walked in her sleep she came to his hut. He goes for a priest and tells Marie he has come to marry her honorably. Just as the ceremony is about to be performed Morton returns and claims her as his wife and Sancho is killed by the officers in a skirmish that ensues.
