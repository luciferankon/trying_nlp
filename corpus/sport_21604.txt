MICHAEL MOORER had a fast but steady rise through the professional boxing ranks. He debuted on March 1988 knocking out Adrian Riggs in the first round. He spent the year taking on a rather ambitious fight schedule in terms of quantity if nothing else. Before the year's end he was undefeated in eleven bouts (winning all by way of early round knockouts) and fighting for the world title for the first time. He acquired the newly created WBO light heavyweight title with a five round knockout of Ramzi Hassan. Michael Moorer's collection of 30 fights over 7 discs.
