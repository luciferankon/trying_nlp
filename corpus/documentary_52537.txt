In the middle of California surrounded by dairies and farms sprung one of the most unique educational experiences in the world. Created by a principal who 'hated school' when he was a kid Fort Roosevelt was built to inspire kids to want to learn. Built and operated by community volunteers Fort Roosevelt was literally a fort: a western style stockade surrounded by 1000 telephone poles. It featured an authentic log cabin pond 7 different environmental areas and wild animal rehabilitation center. Fort Roosevelt became a role model for outdoor educational facilities around the world. It garnered praise from as high as the President of the United States and even attracted Hollywood's attention. The fort drew in approximately 30000 visitors a year. To children the fort was a magical place that inspired awe at every corner. Thousands of children have been positively influenced by the fort's magic. To the school district Fort Roosevelt was an albatross that had to be removed. After 40 years unparalleled success the Fort was destroyed during the Christmas break in 2005. Despite a valiant effort by the community the school district could not be deterred from its mission. 'Fort Roosevelt Requiem' chronicles and recreates the magic of Fort Roosevelt as well as exposes the truth behind its tragic demise.
