In this amusing picture we see the little ones imitating their elders and in fact the tiny actors look for all the world like real little men and women. In the first scene we see two young gentlemen each attended by a mite of a footman calling on a young lady. Each sends up a love missel accompanied by a bouquet to the tiny miss who has won their hearts. The next scene is laid in the wee beauty's bedroom and we see her reclining on the lace-covered pillows as the notes are handed her by the maid. Deciding to interview her admirers she makes a very elaborate toilet and descends. Finding one of the cavaliers more to her taste than the other she accepts his offer to dine so they depart arm-in-arm followed by the less fortunate one who vows vengeance for such an affront. They stop at a fashionable restaurant where they enjoy a good repast after which the lady is placed in a cab by her escort who then turns to give his attention to his rival who has followed them to the caf√©. The latter on being asked to explain why be insists on dogging their footsteps answers with a blow. A duel is immediately decided upon and a remote spot is found where they have it out using their walking sticks as weapons. In the meantime the two footmen are quarreling over the maid and they too decide to engage in combat and are busily engaged in pummeling one another when their masters appear on the scene and separate them. Finally the first lover compromises with his rival and gives him the lady's maid and he seems perfectly satisfied but the poor footmen are left without a sweetheart while the other happy couples are fixed for life.
