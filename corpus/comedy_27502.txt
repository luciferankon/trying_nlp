Graham Braithwaite is a violinist in a B.C. symphony. Unfortunately the symphony folds and much to his horror and disdain he's forced to get a gig with a country band as the bassist. He has to leave the city and his girlfriend Jane to tour the B.C. interior with Frank Hay and his band. At first he has a hard time fitting in but he realizes that Debbie one of the backup singers and Frank's daughter has a great voice and asks Frank if he can work with her. She slowly begins to get more of the set time and he feels more at home in the band. Problems arise between Frank and Debbie and Graham and Jane because of the supposed relationship between Graham and Debbie.
