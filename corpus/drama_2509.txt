The film offers a glimpse at a group of school girls who are very flexible in terms of gender roles playing males both in the school play and in real life. A modern-day all girls high school traditionally celebrates its anniversary by staging Chekov's play but this year the faculty may cancel the play because Noriko a senior was seen smoking in a coffee shop with students from a rival school. Yuko has permed her hair and Kaori kisses her boyfriend on a couch.
