This documentary focuses on how several individuals from Fukushima have decided to live fully in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Disaster. The director Toko Shiiki traveled to Fukushima from the US in order to hear stories directly from the local people not just from the media. Through intense conditions and confusion many of them have developed a new lifestyle in their own way. Some of them left Fukushima others stayed but no matter where they chose to be these people haven't lost their bright spirit. They live fully in the now. Moreover they stay alive by keeping in touch with what they love most - music. Along with the six individuals Shiiki traces inspiring performances and rehearsals of two unforgettable children groups from Fukushima - a Brass band and Japanese drum ensemble. Their life stories and powerful music intertwine revealing the essence of living and encouraging us to consider fundamental questions about our own humanity.
