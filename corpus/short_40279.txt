WATER FALLS is NASA's new Science On a Sphere (SOS) movie introducing the public to the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite mission. This film was made to raise awareness leading up the February 27 2014 launch of the GPM Core satellite. In short GPM is a joint NASA and Japanese Space Agency program that is taking on the essential task of measuring water as it falls to our planet's surface. However this movie is more than a discussion of new space hardware. It aims to engage the viewer in thinking about the role of fresh water in our daily lives. Alongside the orbital paths of the satellite fleet and an overview of how the instruments work we see painterly representations of the water cycle and discover the complexities of understanding water as it falls through the atmosphere. Beautiful seamless photography adds context from the natural world from blossoms in macro to iconic waterfalls and even kayakers rolling in a lake. Indeed what would life be without fresh water?
