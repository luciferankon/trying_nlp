It's death-by-fear (aka scared-to-death) in this deceptively psychological thriller. The hero Mike brings his friends to his grandparents' house for a Halloween party wherein they will all dress up as their innermost fears. Mike's fear is that he's inherited a homicidal legacy from his father. Mike's father was a serial killer who murdered his mother right in front of him when Mike was five before committing suicide. Mike's fear manifests itself in his inability to commit to his girlfriend of 4 1/2 years Peg for fear that he will kill her too. Everything gets rolling when an ancient Indian totem wooden figure named Morty comes to life and starts killing off Mike's friends by making their worst fears come true. The ultimate confrontation comes when Mike has to face his greatest fear - his own father. Twenty years ago the five years old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an ax in an empty road and committing suicide later. On the present days Michael invites his girlfriend Peg and his best friends Chris Jennifer Lisa Ann Ned Mitch Maldive and Trish to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear and together with his Indian friend Crow they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty that would eliminate their fears forever. The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father killing his friends. An unfortunate young man whose father commited an unspeakable act in front of him as a child travels with his mates to his uncle's remote hillside cabin so they can explore their inner fears by dressing up in costumes. Unbeknownst to the clan the uncle has left a nasty secret behind for them to encounter.
