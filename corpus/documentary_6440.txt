The film tells the very real and ongoing story of what many claim is the biggest cover up in aviation history. Passengers and crews for nearly fifty years have been supplied with unfiltered air to breath taken directly from the engines even though this air supply is known to sometimes become contaminated with neurotoxins carcinogens and other hazardous chemicals. With unique access into the aviation industry the film reveals the cover up and serious exposure consequences on flight safety passenger and crew health of those who have and continue to be unknowingly exposed.
