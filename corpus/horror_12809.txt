Two giggly high school lovebirds playfully throw pieces of bloody human brain at one another then take a messy shower in the latest horror flick out of South Carolina which is fast becoming the Gruesome Gus capital of the world. The flick is called GENERATION AX and it's HEATHERS meets SCREAM meets THE TEXAS CHEERLEADER MOM meets BONNIE AND CLYDE. Tommy Faircloth wrote and directed this little low-budget gem starring Marina Morgan as the high school girl whose best friend wants to be a cheerleader so she sort of helps her out with a locker-room hatchet job on the beauty-pageant queen who beat her friend in tryouts. Pretty soon Marina falls for the new kid intown Brian Kelly because he believes that everyone dies because of "fate" so if you kill somebody they would have died anyway. They soon get a chance to try out this cosmological theory ...[on a classmate]. Faircloth keeps this baby moving with plenty of nasty humor and humorous nastiness although the death scenes can be a little lame mostly because Marina holds her little hatchet like such a girl. (You know how girls throw a baseball? Same deal.) Between the time the picture was made and the time it was released Columbine happened which just might have hurt distribution a little bit. It's no longer cool to make funny films about geeky high school misfits killing the jocks and cheerleaders. To which I say: Thank God for South Carolina. Nine dead bodies. Two breasts. Chest-gutting. Multiple cheerleader-hatcheting. Tongue-nailing. Brain-hacking. Body of a "skeezer" deposited in the popcorn machine. Stiletto pom-pom to the face. Head rolls. Gratuitous water-bong.
