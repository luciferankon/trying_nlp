Alfredo (writer director himself) has Multiple Sclerosis! After a MRI scan they see new brain defects. Alfredo has one last wish: to climb the Himalaya. The doctor called it absolute madness and the doctor's last line is: YOU DON'T GO! But next scene we see the Himalaya from the sky followed by Alfredo limping and stumbling in the endless mountains where he passes out to regain consciousness with a Budist nun in front of him. Then we get Alfredo's stay at the convent where life is simple hard working in the garden and devoted to a better world for themselves. All or most of the very old and one young nun are telling their stories in long but breathtaking single shots. Alfredo is pictured how he starts to think and even learn some of the language going to nearby cultural Budist ceremonies. Meanwhile reflecting on his MS (in beautiful poetry) we see traditional performances showing the fights agains demons and his demons. The (very) old nuns whom expect to die soon are happy with their destinies. It up to the viewer to make conclusions on what is in Alfredo's mind when he's finally heading back home.
