Director 'Nicholas Ray (I)' (qv) is eager to complete a final film before his imminent death from cancer. 'Wim Wenders' (qv) is working on his own film _Hammett (1982)_ (qv) in Hollywood but flies to New York to help Ray realize his final wish. Ray's original intent is to make a fiction film about a dying painter who sails to China to find a cure for his disease. He and Wenders discuss this idea but it is obviously unrealistic given Ray's state of health.
