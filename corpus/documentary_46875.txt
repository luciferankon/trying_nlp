Haďti a Carribean island. A land torn between America and Africa. After three decades of bloody dictatorship President Aristide restores democracy in 1994. He disbands the army and creates from start to finish a new police force. 5200 young men most of them academics are trained within only four months and sent away throughout the country. Today from Cité Soleil a shanty town of 400000 inhabitants to Hinche a remote province a few Haitian policemen struggle to carry out a mission that becomes each day more difficult.
