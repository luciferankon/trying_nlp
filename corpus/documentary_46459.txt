In the spirit of the great television rallies our ROSES DES SABLES series will follow competing two-woman teams as they race across the rugged challenging terrain of exotic Morocco. This certainly isn't some tame game show where everything's been comfortably pre-arranged - but rather reality complete with all its often-harsh surprises and gritty challenges!!! The documentary series ROSES DES SABLES sticks close by a few competing French and Quebec teams following them through the ups and downs of their adventures and unexpected frequently-unforgettable challenges. The rally which begins in France and ends in Marrakesh is divided into seven stages as the female racers make their way across the Moroccan desert. Our series will stick with the teams every step of the way plunging viewers into the heat of the action deep in nature's untamed wilderness dramatically reminding us that when we challenge nature victory is far from assured.
