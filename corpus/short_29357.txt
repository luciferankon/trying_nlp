The Swallow and the Squeeze is an experimental science film that illustrates the relationship between the mind and gut through the process of what happens when you eat. A collaborative effort between scientists researchers dancers and visual artists envisions this process from as an expanded audio/visual experience that privileges affect and the somatic. The resulting film is a meditation on the representation of the human body through the history and philosophy of western science.
