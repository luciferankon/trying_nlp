The Disinherited after the fragment "Platonov" by Anton Chekhov is a live cinema performance adaptation of Chekhov's first full-length play chronicling an emotionally bankrupt society of anti-heroes who are less heroically also losing their loves their homes and perhaps their humanity as well. In an unprecedented experiment the performance is realized simultaneously as live play (Platonov) and feature film shot and edited in real time and simulcast to movie theaters.
