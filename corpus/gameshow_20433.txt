He Said She Said was the original name of the original format of what would become the popular 70's game show Tattletales. Joe Garagiola hosted this iteration. The primary difference between formats was the number of couples and who they played for; He Said She Said had 4 couples whereas Tattletales had 3 and where the He Said She Said couples were each only playing for 'one lucky couple in the studio audience' Tattletales - with the red green and 'banana' sections of the studio audience - had a couple for them - in their entirety.
