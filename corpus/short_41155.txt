Four apparently random murders are intertwined in the mind of an unforgiving killer. A doctor a lawyer a narcissist and a drunk do not seem to know each other but as events unfold we see the string that ties them to one fateful night. Of special note this film was shot in Chicago in the dead of winter and intentionally shot without sound. All the sound was created in post production.
