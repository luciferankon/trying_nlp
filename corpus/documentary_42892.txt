COCKFIGHT is a voyage into the underground world of rooster fighting. The film chronicles the harrowing and hilarious adventures of three wildly different characters. The first Manuel is a salty 73-year old who attends illegal cockfights in California and fights to preserve the ancient but embattled sport. The second Clara is a vibrant Latina who was forced to quit cockfighting when the sport was outlawed in Arizona. The third Larry is a firebrand ex-patriot exiled to Mexico where he fights roosters for a living. Cockfight pierces the veil of secrecy that cloaks this enormously popular yet controversial activity. By bringing you in contact with people whose daily lives are defined by cockfighting the film seeks to demonstrate how people can draw meaning value and humor from something many see as savage and barbaric.
