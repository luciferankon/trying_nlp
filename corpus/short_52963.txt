Alone at Last is a playful drama that follows a young couple from the bustle of their wedding send-off to the stillest hours of the night. Told with warmth and candor it is an intimate portrait of a less than perfect relationship. For as anyone who has ever been in a relationship knows even the best are infuriatingly-yet beautifully-imperfect.
