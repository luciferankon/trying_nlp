This feature documentary follows 33-year-old Ariel after his legs are shredded by an industrial dough mixer in Mendoza Argentina. Ariel embodies the ongoing duel between man and machine: he eventually sets out to rebuild his broken identity to keep his family together and to design his own artificial legs. Ariel's newfound transhumanity is represented in a juxtaposition of his daily life with dreamlike inner worlds pushing the boundary between the real and the imaginary. This story of healing and transformation is an introspective journey tinged with touches of magical realism.
