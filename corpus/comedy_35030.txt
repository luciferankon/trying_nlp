The Mary Whitehouse Experience was an rapid-fire observational sketch comedy show which first aired on radio and then moved to television where it ran on the BBC (BBC 2) between 1990-1992. It's title was a tongue-in-cheek jab on the well-known morality crusader 'Mary Whitehouse (I)' (qv). The show featured a lot of topical humour based on famous people films and TV shows of the day along with original character material in a format somewhat similar to _"Kids In the Hall (1988)". The series starred 2 comedy duos (who had all graduated from Cambridge University); Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis and David Baddiel and Rob Newman. It was first broadcast on the radio during the late 1980s before airing to TV.
