Thirteen-year-old Frank Pollack (Eastman Presser) eats sleeps and breathes movies. After receiving a camcorder for his Bar Mitzvah Frank decides to make his own film Zombie. "It's not a horror movie" he explains. "It's a murder mystery. It's Hitchcockian." But as Frank labors away on Zombie he increasingly neglects everything else including his friends family and personal well-being. Featuring music by Ted Leo and the Pharmacists Movie Boy is a bittersweet coming-of-age story about passion youth and the love of movies.
