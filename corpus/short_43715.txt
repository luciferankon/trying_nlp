Filmmaker Marzano chose to tell this story in pure pantomime with no spoken dialogue: On the Long Beach boardwalk on Long Island a girl (Barbara Balmer) walks along with a young man but the discussion becomes intense. She indicates that she wants to leave him and he demands an explanation. The two separate. After she walks away from him she joins a young woman who has been waiting for her. As they go off together it becomes apparent they are lesbians.
