Get The Message was broadcast on weekday mornings in 1964 for three cycles (39 weeks). It was a game-panel show that featured two teams (male and female) consisting of two guest stars and one contestant on each team. The stars would attempt to "get the message" to the contestant with one word clues. The game was an amalgam of several other Goodson-Todman games shows including obviously "Password".
