Deep in the Canadian North six young guys embarked on an epic adventure - to explore some of the most remote and untouched rivers in the world. Four Canadians two Kiwis two dogs (Zephyr and Taiger) three boats and two hundred pounds of camera equipment on a 63 day mission - it was always going to be a mighty test of endurance determination and friendship. But beyond the swarming mosquitoes technical challenges and physical hardship what they didn't expect was the impact of the stories from one First Nations family. This chance encounter introduced them to people so tightly tied to the land and the river that they live on and showed the team that the Peel Watershed debate is not just about protecting the environment but also a way of life.A boys-own adventure turns into a mission to truly discover the secrets of the north and show the world why some places are worth preserving.
