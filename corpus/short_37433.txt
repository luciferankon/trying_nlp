This is the film version of Lejlighedsminder (Memories From an Apartment). Originally the work is a film installation: a cross-over work that merges narrative film video art and theatre monologues into a new way to show film and communicate with the audience. The work consists of five short films 6-8 min. each screened simultaneously in five separate rooms in an apartment set. In each film a young woman's everyday doings are interrupted by an intruding unpleasant memory that takes over her mind and she is forced to relive the bad memory. The films run in loops and while watching one of the films you can hear the sound from the others too. This creates a cacophonous and claustrophobic sense of being at the mercy of your unwanted memories. The installation is a no-budget production created by Faroese film maker Katrin Ottarsdóttir and her daughter actress Hildigunn Eyđfinsdóttir. Hildigunn wrote the monologues and did the acting and Katrin did the filming and the editing.
