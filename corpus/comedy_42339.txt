UARGH! To the cataleptic search of the insane element A social and cultural film in 4D: Delirious Demented Irreverent MyGodifIfindwhowroteit! It's better to pursue easiness rather than happiness or to waste time rather than to be efficient: all this is UARGH! a grotesque fiction promoted by the Movie Circle Lamaca Gioconda and IMFI - Institute for Materials and Unaware Forms supported by GLFC - Genova Liguria Film Commission ServizItalia and Asl 3 Genovese with patronage of UICC - Unione Italiana Circoli Cinema Roma Italy. Born as a strong social condemnation the movie develops into a dreamlike and absurd tale on the subject of "idleness as cancellation of all no motion absolute stillness emptying actions". In the real world people don't want to think so they move incessantly in Uargh! the absence of motion facilitates positive thinking and creativity. The Uargh! becomes the means of research while La Zanzottereide turns into the Company of Seekers in a surreal atmosphere. It's thorough research that comes from afar and goes beyond duty and guilt imposed by a society of consumption and increasingly frantic hyper-engaged.
