A condensed version of _"The Choir: Unsung Town" (2009)_ (qv) is presented. The show told the story of choirmaster 'Gareth Malone (I)' (qv)'s year long project to create choirs in South Oxhey a housing estate north of London which was seen as a cultural wasteland when he arrived. Gareth and some of the people who participated in or were indirectly associated with the project comment on what happened and the longer lasting effects of the project on them. At the end of that show Gareth agreed to continue directing the choirs he had started tasks that he did for an additional eighteen months. What is happening with the choirs now and what Gareth's current role is mentioned.
