The creators of The Puppet Monster Massacre bring you a grindhouse spectacular filled with blood boobs special fx and southern rock. This is the story of a religious cowboy a lost soul and a beautiful one-eyed grease monkey fixing to exact bloody vengeance on the same undead S.O.B. He's a low-down dirty disgusting depraved sadistic psychotic hell-bent grade F Zombie A-Hole who preys on naked twin girls. He ain't gonna know what hit him! Zombie A-Hole takes place in a world that's a bit different from our own. A realm that teeters on the edge of sleaze and comic book stylized awesomeness. It's Planet Terror meets Sin City meets The Good The Bad and The Ugly. All the men are hard-asses and all the women are bombshells. Just because vengeance is your way of life doesn't mean you can't look damn sexy while you dole out hearty doses of whoop-ass. Everything is just a bit bigger and more interesting than their real life counterparts. This is a an exploitation flick with a southern gothic flair.
