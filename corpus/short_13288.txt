In January 1999 at the height of the Lewinsky-Clinton affair Herman Asselberghs and Dieter Lesage asked me if I would be in for a trip to Lost Nation. They explained this was part of a project they were setting up in Brussels: a place slash library slash installation about vanished nations such as Yugoslavia Czechoslovakia East and West Germany USSR and Zaire. Intriguing so I thought and I told them I was in. But where was Lost Nation? And since it was lost where could we find it? Browsing through their library Herman and Dieter stumbled onto Lost Nation an American village located on Highway 136 in Eastern Iowa with a community of 497 citizens. Would I be interested to check it out? Sure. And so this little road movie was the result. A trip to a nation where the average citizen spends about 5 years of his lifetime waiting in line 2 years trying to reach people by telephone 1 year searching for misplaced objects 8 months opening junk-mail and 6 months sitting at traffic lights. A nation that attempted to impeach the wrong president.
