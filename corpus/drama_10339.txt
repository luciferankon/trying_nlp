Three people meet and become friends in London. Two of them form a relationship in turns loving and destructive. The death of one of them forces the others to reassess their lives and change or die. The main themes of 'Egression' are escape and redemption. All the characters are trying by some means or another to escape from aspects of their pasts. Whether it's by drinking taking drugs gambling casual sex. What begins as fun distractions in youth leads to lives of self abuse and addiction. With forms of therapy frowned upon by the strata of society composing the piece and families distant or uncaring the characters have no recourse but each other. After the lead female character takes her own life the others are left with the repercussions; blame guilt self-doubt. Thoughts of the futility of their own existence. Deciding to simply keep on living is the nearest to redemption these characters allow themselves or are perhaps even capable of.
