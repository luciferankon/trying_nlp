Atlantis is known across the world as a myth. But is this really the truth? No matter what cultural history we explore we discover a story very similar to the one we know about Atlantis...why? For years experts and researchers have been looking in the wrong place at the wrong people and for the wrong thing. For too long historians have focused on a few words left to us by Plato whose meaning they misunderstood. The fact is even Plato didn't understand what had been told to him. The startling truth is that the remnants of Atlantis are all around us right now and have been for a very long time - long before recorded history. New research and insight exposes Atlantis to be a pivotal part of our ancient beginnings. The legendary lost city that many think of as myth was in fact a very real and highly advanced civilization that was uniquely aware of the laws of the universe and was able to access hidden dimensions and make contact with extraterrestrial races. This is the story of the real Atlantis. This is the real lost history of mankind itself. "Fascinating research and evidence of a lost epoch in history." - OH Krill author of Montauk Babies. "Highly entertaining and enlightening." - United Media Network. "Philip Gardiner has found the 'Hiram Key' to Atlantis - Bravo!" - John Jay Harper author of Tranceformers Shamans of the 21st Century.
