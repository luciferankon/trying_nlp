BIPOLARIZED is about one man's personal journey to heal. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder Ross' psychiatrist told him he would live with the disorder for the rest of his life and that he would have to take lithium to control symptoms. To Ross taking the drug daily felt like a chemical lobotomy leaving him in a foggy drug-induced haze. Ross ultimately decided to resolve his symptoms outside of conventional medicine. He progressively reduced his use of the psychotropic drug lithium at an experimental clinic in Costa Rica. What ensued was a self-exploration into alternative treatments to treat his condition and a journey delving into the root cause of his mental breakdown. The film uses Ross' personal experiences to tell a larger story about medication. It will reveal how we are labelling more and more people with mental illnesses and how in tandem we are prescribing more and more toxic psychotropic drugs to treat these illnesses. BIPOLARIZED weaves together a series of interviews with activists psychiatrists and other psychiatric survivors who have challenged the status quo as well as recounts some of the alternative therapies Ross uses to maintain his mental emotional and physical health.
