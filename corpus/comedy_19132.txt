A creation of the Air Farce's Roger Abbott and Don Ferguson which gives a half and hour to comedy troupe's to support up and coming artists shine lights on little known troupes and honour better known stars. Each troupe usually appears in only one or two episodes sharing half the epsiode with another. It's a small taste of the underground Canadian comedy scene.
