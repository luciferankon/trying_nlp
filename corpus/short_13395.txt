An eager narrator tells a story from a stage. As he tells his story he has to power through difficulties such as pop-up ads and budget constraints. After getting to his story he spins a yarn about a young man whose entire life is on a constant loop with no variation. He wakes up passes a girl with an orange hat on his way to school makes it through the school day and goes straight home. However his routine is thrown off balance when he sees the girl with the orange hat struggling to walk and he offers her a ride to school. The two forge a friendship and deal with what they mean to one another and how that overlaps with what they mean to themselves.
