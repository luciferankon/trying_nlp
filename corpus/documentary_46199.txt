To sum up the life and work of British artist Genesis Breyer P-Orridge is close to impossible. Not only because of the wide range of artistic disciplines but also because of the timespan since the mid 1960s to the present day that has been saturated by hundreds of records thousands of concerts exhibitions interviews videos spoken word performances collages sculptures philosophy cultural engineering occultism and radical transgender concepts. A couple of descriptions are still valid after these 50 years of active creativity and provocation. P-Orridge is a romantic existentialist and a cultural engineer. Everything is both work as such and seed for cultural and behavioural change.
