Wandering around wine bars and pubs drinking thirty-year old worker Oldrich ('Petr Kostka' (qv)) who is celebrating the birth of his son meets a seventeen-year old lad called Yellow T-shirt Boy ('Vladim√≠r Pucholt' (qv)). Yellow T-shirt Boy is a problematic young man. Forced to leave his job because he kept provoking conflicts he now finds some satisfaction as a member of a gang led by the failed actor Ancek ('Ludek Munzar' (qv)). He gets no support at home either; his father has vanished without a trace and his mother has been unable to cope. Oldrich learns all this in the small hours of the following day after waking up next to Yellow T-shirt Boy sobering-up station. The new father is so moved by the young man's life that he starts taking care of the boy.
