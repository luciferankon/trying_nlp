Road Show gets into the heart of America's obsession with performing and becoming a star under the notion that every town has a story and every town has a star. The series centers on small town talent shows and the comedy that ensues when a little bit of Hollywood shows up to give people who have long submerged their artistic dreams of becoming a star a chance to be the big fish in the little pond of their hometown. Each episode the series holds open call auditions welcoming everyone from singers and dancers to comedy acts and jugglers. Two mentors then select four finalists to participate in a talent show held at a local venue. The audience gets to know the finalists and their back-stories as they are coached over multiple days by these mentors. The goal is to bring out the best of their abilities in preparing them for their performance at a "Big Show" in front of a local audience who will select the winner.
