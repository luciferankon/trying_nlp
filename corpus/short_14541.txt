Mágico the god. A magician that moved in the tiny football area as elegantly as he did in the eternal night. Jorge Alberto Barillas arrived to Spain with the 1982 World Cup wearing blue from his beloved country. He was leaving behind two years of civil war. The glory days and bohemian nights lay ahead of him. The magician's legend became a myth in the people's hearts. For all his team players he could have been the best ever player but all he wanted was to "be happy without stepping on anyone's toes". Back in Salvador everybody follows either Real Madrid or Barcelona F.C. and of course Cádiz F.C.
