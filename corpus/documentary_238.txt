Celebrated chef Luke Nguyen in the third instalment of his popular series takes us on a culinary journey across the Greater Mekong region of Southeast Asia. Beginning in southwest China Luke explores the culinary cultures and centuries old traditions of Yunnan Province from the Naxi people of Lijiang to the Dai communities of Xishuangbana. Journeying south to Myanmar Luke uncovers the unique flavours of the former capital Yangon. He learns the family recipes of Inle Lake communities and cooks with the hill tribes of the Shan State. Crossing the border into northern Thailand Luke learns from local fishermen and Aka grandmothers that the mighty Mekong River is more than just a source of food - it is a way of life.
