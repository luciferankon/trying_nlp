An NIH doctor puts her career on the line as she battles to save children with disabling mental illness. Could the answer be simpler than everyone thinks? Nine-year-old Kathryn was a normal healthy child. She was a star student athlete and dancer. In a matter of days she would become totally dysfunctional. Kathryn had alarming rapid-onset OCD... refusing to eat or drink. How did this happen? Kathryn's family and many families like hers turned to a fractured medical system where there is fierce disagreement about how to help her. More often than not a child with these symptoms would be diagnosed as having mental illness. One NIH doctor unlocks a clue but in the process of informing the medical community is ridiculed and scorned. "My Kid is Not Crazy" tracks the journey of six children and their families as they become tangled in the nightmare of a medical system heavily influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. Here it's common for a caregiver to prescribe a young child a Selective Serotonin Uptake Inhibitor (SSRI) but hesitate to prescribe an antibiotic to counteract a potential infectious-based trigger. For some of these kids what happens after several years is shocking and sad. Because of years of misdiagnoses some live with the consequences for the rest of their lives.
