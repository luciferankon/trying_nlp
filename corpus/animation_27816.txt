Willow & Constance are just your ordinary Hairy & Scary kids having adventures in an "extra-ordinary" world. Like any Hairy worth his salt Willow is a boy who greets each day with enthusiasm - and maybe a little too much naivete. Constance true to her Scary roots is a girl who loves having a plan and sticking to the rules even though she's a bit clumsy tripping and knocking things over endlessly. And of course throwing a wrench in the works is none other than their scheming classmate Junior. You couldn't really call him a "friend" since he enjoys making life difficult for Willow in order to get closer to his beloved Constance - (SIGH). He can keep on dreaming because Constance's heart belongs to Willow. So you see there's never a bad-hair day on the Hairy Scary Planet. Between the kids quirky adults pet Boolus toy Niak-Niaks and out-of-control inventions every viewer will be thoroughly amused and wondering: Could it get any stranger?
