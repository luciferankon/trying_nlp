a comedy web series about a passive and gawky Black woman named Maya who continuously bumps into white conundrums while living her NYC life. Maya is a slightly-failing jewelry designer who works full time in a nanny-matching service to pay the bills. She manages her dating life and personal qualms with the advisory of her best friend named Lana who is white. Sit Black & Relax is JustLatasha's first scripted work. Latasha wrote and directed the series as an ode to the normal life many young Black women live as an effort to dismantle the narrow stereotypes often provided by Hollywood.
