This is the first experimental video in a series based on Angie van Broekhuizen's concept of Ecneconni or lost innocence. In this short piece there is an exploration of the defilement and reversal of the loss of innocence through use of common childhood foods and children's dolls. Eerie sound design by Richard Schmoocoo Wagger provide a perfect atmosphere for the narrative. Filmed with a Canon T2i 18-55mm lens and edited in Adobe Premiere and AfterEffects.
