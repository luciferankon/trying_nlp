Things are going badly for Raymond Fox. His high-powered wife Jenny has left him for a younger man and looking after his teenage kids - nerdy Sara (17) and wayward Robinson (15) - and his gorgeous suburban family home is his only consolation. But now Jenny has found happiness with Joe she's keen for the kids to live with her and plans to buy their home and put Raymond out on the street. Returning home unexpectedly early from a holiday Raymond is shocked to find that his cheery neighbour Lydia hasn't just been watering his plants. She's also been working as a prostitute to supplement her and her daughter's lifestyle and has been using his house to do it. Raymond is desperate to raise enough money to put a stop to Jenny's plans but there aren't many opportunities for failed mechanics turned house-husband. So while he's initially shocked at Lydia's activities he soon realises that his housekeeping skills are surprisingly transferable. Meanwhile Jenny's attempts to create a happy family unit with Sara Robinson and new love Joe aren't going quite to plan.
