Véra Cabral works in a psychiatric emergency unit. One evening she finds her obnoxious and pretentious boss Edouard Russel waiting for her on her doorstep crying and begging for her help. His gibbering son is found pacing up and down in his bedroom with a dead body at his feet cut to pieces. Russel wants Véra to proclaim his insanity to prevent him from going to prison. But Véra refuses to acknowledge the young man's responsibility for the murder and decides to investigate for herself.
