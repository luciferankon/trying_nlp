Two bondage stories in one Isaac W. bondage film. In the first story Connie Sims and Tabatha Katz are cat burglars who are adept at stealing jewels and cash from unsuspecting folks but not so good at keeping their ill-gotten gains from a determined thug who steals their goodies and leaves them bound and gagged. Soon a third burglar played by red-haired Natasha Flade falls victim to the burly jackal. In the second vignette when Krystal Knight's car breaks down the singer requests assistance from her biggest fan who keeps the rock star a bound prisoner.
