The Child Of Music explores Mozart's frenzied life and offers a visually poetic interpretation of the composer's String Quartet No. 15 in D Minor K.421. Biographical vignettes introduce each of the quartet's four movements which unfold as a series of imaginatively choreographed tableaux featuring dancers and actors who perform scenes freely inspired by Mozart's life.
