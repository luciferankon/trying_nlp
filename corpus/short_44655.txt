More than just a video clip this is an experience to be seen and felt. This epic music video directed by the great Jonathan Demme consists of massive close-ups of New Order band members each performing with their musical instrument or sometimes changing them from time to time while providing the spectacular song "The Perfect Kiss"  single from their second album.
