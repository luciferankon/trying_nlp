Epifânia Évora loved music and the piano the most anyone can. Throughout her life she turned joy and pain into melodies and sang them breaking all conventions. To this nonagenarian Cape Verdean woman daughter of the coladera's creator and mother of 14 children life only made sense with applause. Did she hear all the applause she deserved? From the glorious and warm nights at the Café Royal in Mindelo to her intimate family life in the inhospitable island of Sal we traveled with this passionate woman and celebrated with her the unique culture of a country of musicians that tenderly called her "Dona Tututa".
