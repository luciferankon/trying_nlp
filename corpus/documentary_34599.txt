The M.V. Pacific Coaster was one of nearly 900 British coasters 400 of which were probably at sea at the time. She was a 1700-ton liner coaster running to a definite schedule. In this programme she was followed to sea sailing by night from London Docks down London River past the South Goodwins Lightship and down Channel. She sails on across the great trade routes past Land's End to Queenstown and Cork and finally to Liverpool the home of many of her crew and of her master Captain Joe Beckett OBE.
