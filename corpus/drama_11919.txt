After not having seen each other in five years Chris Terry goes to visit his younger sister Noelle Terry in Montr√©al. Their lives both together and apart have been turbulent ones with something toxic having affected the way they interact with each other. Chris who has just divorced his wife Denise is a recovering alcoholic. Although he has never served time he has committed crimes in his past. Noelle a drug addict turns tricks to make ends meet. She has just completed a stint in prison. Upon Chris' arrival Noelle proposes to Chris that they enter into a three-way with a john who will pay $500 for the trick. Noelle had been trying to find another man to do the job but was unable to find one on such short notice. Noelle implies that she needs the money to pay off a third party and she figures Chris owes her. Despite not identifying himself as being gay or even bisexual despite having previously had a relationship with a man Chris agrees. As Chris and Noelle's encounter progresses what they displayed on the surface in entering into this agreement may not be their true motivation - or the motivation for Chris making this visit after all this time - as they talk about money drugs power and control and Noelle's ex-boyfriend Martin.
