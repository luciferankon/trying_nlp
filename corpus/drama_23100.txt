Twenty years later Katherine Brenton a wealthy young woman is on a yacht trip in the South Pacific with playboy Valentine Langford testing her theory that men and women can have platonic relationships under any conditions. When Langford makes a pass at her she knocks him out and flees the yacht for a nearby desert island--which happens to be the same one that young John Charnock was stranded on 20 years earlier. They soon find each other. Complications--and an earthquake--ensue.
