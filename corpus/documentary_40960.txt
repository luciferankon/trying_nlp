At the age of thirteen Sylvain Bédard was diagnosed with a hypertrophic cardiopathy a hereditary disease that causes a thickening of the heart tissue. In 1999 his heart is only working at 15% capacity. Then in summer 2000 Sylvain is given a new heart: the transplant proves a success. Since then Sylvain Bédard has been training and has participated in the National Transplant Games where he's won eight medals. He's also been the first heart transplant patient to reach in full autonomy the top of Mont Blanc at a height of 4807 metres. Accompagnied by his cardiologist and his friend Michel White Sylvain is ready to face a new challenge: climbing the top of the highest summit in Bolivia Mount Sajama a volcano standing at an altitude of 6542 metres. Surrounded by a team of scientists he's invested with an unusual mission: furthering medical research in high altitude in order to understand better how oxygen deprivation can improve the heart's irrigation. Father of five boys Sylvain wants to find solutions to increase his life expectancy and that of his children who might also be threatened by the same disease. From start to finish this documentary features an adventure of epic proportions which will at once thrill and touch you.
