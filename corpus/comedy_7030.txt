The easy-going village policeman Artturi Sakari Reinikainen from the series "Tankki Täyteen" has been transferred from the village of Hämeenperä to Tampere city. His stint as a Tampere beat cop starts on the wrong foot as he ends up being thrown in the drunk bin on his first night in Tampere ("Yea yea another one who thinks he's a cop"). Reinikainen is not discouraged by the experience and soon he is found upholding the law in his usual talkative laid-back but honest fashion. The other cops in the precinct are in a category all by themselves including a would-be ladies man a cop who tends to have to search for the mot juste and a veteran copper who is always testing his workmates on their knowledge of trivia.
