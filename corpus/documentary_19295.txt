15-20 years ago I never thought I would be where I am today. But I was determined not to settle for less. I did not give up. I always worked harder to achieve more. I did not have the confidence I have today. Everything was built slowly creating a support system around me with people I got to trust and who helped me with different aspects of my life. At 18 years old I had no money no education no girlfriend no job no home no stability no confidence no skills no work experience & hardly any friends. Today I have a full-time job have lots of work skills am married have a child have a dog have a home have a car have lots of friends am financially stable have succeeded in many classes programs seminars to improve my skills have done lots of volunteer work over the years to help me acquire work skills which would make me more employable have good insight and control over my illness instead of it having control over me I am well respected by my friends family co-workers and community and am a contributing member of society. I want people to look at me and say (or think) "If he can do it I can do it too". In this DVD my goal is to give you tools coping mechanisms to better deal with your illness. The coping mechanisms that I suggest in this DVD are my own personal tools. You probably have tried some of them in the past with no success. But the secret for me is the combination and the perseverance of applying them. I know it's not easy living with a mental illness but I strongly believe in today's recovery movement where you make positive choices in your life and stick to them. I sincerely hope that this message touches you in one way or another. Thank you for your support and know matter what ''never give up.'
