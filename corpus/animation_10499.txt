Meet SamSam the smallest of the superheroes! Okay for a superhero he doesn't quite yet know how to use his super powers. But it doesn't mean he can't fly his own SamSaucer into space or can't deal with dirty-rotten monsters Space pirates or with the horrible king Marthy the 1rst! Sometimes he does need a little help from his cuddly SuperTeddy friends SamMummy or SamDaddy. And granted sometimes using his noggin and a bit of imagination gets the work done too. SamSam is a fun 3D animation series directed by Tanguy de Kermel and comic books created bt Serge Bloch and published in magazines worldwide.
