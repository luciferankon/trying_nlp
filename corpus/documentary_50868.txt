What if you could get behind the wheel and race through the solar system? We scale down celestial objects and place them on earth to better appreciate the scale of the universe. Imagine chasing a comet down the highway as it zips in from Jupiter or taking a day trip to Mars. Join former astronaut Chris Hadfield - a Youtube sensation for his performance of David Bowie's "Space Oddity" aboard the International Space Station - and his hitchhikers Michio Kaku and astronomers Derek Pitts and Laura Danly. It's a joyride from New York to California - and from the sun to Pluto.
