Ella (Jackie Manker) returns to her mom's summer cottage in Centralia Illinois and connects with a younger jazz musician Tyler (Cody Heuer) at her stepfather's wake. On a date she runs into an ex-boyfriend (played by baseball great Adam Wainwright). To round out the love triangle her mother Naomi (Sandy Sparks) has another man in mind -- age-appropriate Dr. Gordon (Bill Finkbiner).
