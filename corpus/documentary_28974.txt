The history of Ecuador was shaken in 1981 by the sudden death of Jaime Roldós and his wife Martha Bucaram in a suspicious plane crash. Described by Gabriel Garcia Marquez as a "president with a generous heart" Roldós had sought the democratic leadership of a continent that was subject to the power of brutal military dictatorships. The film examines his two deaths: the probable conspiracy generated by his policy of Human Rights advocacy in the continent and the Shakespearean drama of his three children faced with the manipulation of the image of their parents by a populist party created by members of their own family. After thirty years of silence combining investigative journalism and film essay the film leads us to discover a surprising and unknown chapter in the history of Latin America that resonates deeply in the present.
