Singing praise to sun and weapons is a documentary in ten parts exploring Care and contemporary human condition through words and visual emotions. It does so by meeting twelve internationally renowned philosophers listening to them in a private setting and then looking at life outside and farther on at the natural world it comes across thus arousing a radical daring exchange between words and images. This composite treatment is born especially from the willing of recreating a real and concrete dimension of the contemporary world in order to offer appropriate credibility and effectiveness. As when in the best and worst moments the sun and weapons strike unexpectedly so the television series narrates through photos and music by powerful unexpected blows and converts its title in a positive way together listening word that becomes the only effective weapon.
