A late night call from Accident and Emergency shatters the lifelong friendship of neighbouring families the Hartes and Golds. 17-year-old Emily Gold is dead from a gunshot wound to the head. All the evidence points to childhood sweetheart (and neighbour) Chris Hartes. The two families search for answers to the questions slowly destroying their lives. Once the murder trial begins key evidence (Emily's diary) is withheld and as malice builds the families grow further apart. Chris is the only one to know the truth but can he bring himself to reveal the secret of the pact he had with Emily?
