Late-night talk show featuring chats with guests and spontaneous vox-pop. Also featuring a weekly competition (which was the same in each episode - to guess the content of a brown paper bag) a grand prize (an old yellow van which was being decorated by the various weekly guests as the show went on) but which was never won (nobody guessed the correct content). The overall goal for the series though was to create a movement to launch a follow-up to the world famous Galathea sea expeditions (the last one took place in 1950-1952). The weekly guests each contributed something to the expedition (Danish-Pop singer Richard Ragnvald recorded the expedition's theme song). Eventually in the final episode Galathea Expedition III was launced.
