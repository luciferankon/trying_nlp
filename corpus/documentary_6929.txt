How do you expect me to make a living?. On the 17th December 2010 Tarek al-Tayeb Mohamed Bouazizi doused himself in petrol and levelled this question at the Tunisian authorities who refused to return a simple set of scales he needed to run his modest business scales they had illegally confiscated.

At the end of one decade Bouazizi's actions forged the next. His desperate defiance in the face of autocracy ensured the next would be different. It would be filled by a potent mix of bloodshed anger and hope. And it would belong to one person. The dissident.
