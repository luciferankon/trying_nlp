Grady is a young farming boy who likes playing his guitar and singing along. Unfortunately his conservative uncle Kermit doesn't approve of this. On a trip into town Kermit loses all the family's money in a poker game. To get the family back on their feet Grady reluctantly records a song for a local TV show. This throws him head-first into the crazy and upside-down world of show business much to Kermit's dismay!
