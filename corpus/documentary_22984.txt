A documentary film that reveals the divided world of competitive jump roping. The two top American teams the Bouncing Bulldogs and the Double Dutch Forces belong to separate leagues that do not compete against one another. After twenty years of separation they finally meet at Apollo Theater in Harlem for a competition which features "fusion" routines where Double Dutch is blended with hip- hop dance and music.
