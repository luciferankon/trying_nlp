The film cuts between two linear narratives. A young woman receives life changing news and decides to keep her family and friends away. Through her isolation and unexplainable guilt she must agree with her own conscience that one day she will die and she can't waste her limited time on regretting the decisions she has made thus going through a spiritual and emotional turmoil. The other narrative follows two young men who are estranged to each other following a destined path through unknown lands as they discover their friendship and the extremes they face against each other as people who have to rely on only their instinct. The two narratives fall into place by the end as the girl accepts the idea of death in a positive light and the two boys accept the quarrels between them.
