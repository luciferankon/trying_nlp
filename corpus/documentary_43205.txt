De Bopebistro Tour accompanies Luxembourgish folk-rock band "Serge Tonnar and Legotrip" on their acoustic tour through the small rural cafés of the Luxembourgish countryside. More than a musical documentary it's also an ethnographic study of a local culture that's disappearing fast. The stories that are being told in the songs are echoed by the stories told by the old café owners. A film about life and death music beer and brandy.
