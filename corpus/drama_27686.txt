When the reclusive poet laureate Portia Grey starts a writers' group six women can't stay away. From all walks of life -- a mother a solider a pastor's only child a teenager a detective and a wizened woman in her eighties -- the writers gather every week in the hundred-year-old arts center at the edge of Port Laurel. And as they wait for the laureate to make her grand appearance the secrets and lies begin to build up in the mysterious sitting room. "The Laurels" is an eight-episode prime time mini series drama (airing to three million Washington State homes in 2016) about six diverse writers each with their own secrets. When the elusive and mysterious poet laureate invites local authors to her writers' group no one knows what to expect. But over the course of eight episodes strangers become friends enemies rivals and more. And what about Ms. Grey herself? Will she ever grace The Laurels sitting group with her presence?
