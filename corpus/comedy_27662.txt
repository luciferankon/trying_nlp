They don't know each other yet it's in the same town that they will all spend Christmas Eve. At the station Lara Jean-François and Alice are waiting. The evening can now start but for all of them this unusual and eventful 24th of December will dramatically change their lives and remain unforgettable. Mélanie a housewife in her forties falls in love with a Father Christmas whom she hired for the night. Charles a man in his fifties has invited his young mistress Valérie to spend the evening with his wife and daughter pretending she's his cousin. As for Jean-François he feels the need to be alone far from his family. In these conditions the magic of Christmas has trouble working.
