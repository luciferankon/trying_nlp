It's an epidemic. How many viral videos do we need to see before the live deaths of unarmed black men stop. What is it going to take before we all care asks Dr. Anthony Burrow a professor from Cornell University a participant in the documentary that speaks to a time when he was profiled with guns drawn. On September 13 2013 unarmed Jonathan Ferrell was in a serious car accident after a night out with work colleagues. After knocking on the first door he came to in search for help the home owner called 911 and reported a break-in. When police officers showed-up almost 20 minutes later Jon stood waiting looking relieved that help had arrived. Within 17 seconds Jonathan was tased then shot at 12 times and hit ten times. This documentary shares an intimate story beyond the headlines of a love story cut short. Unconscious Bias is real says Cache' who was Jon's high-school sweet-heart and fianc√© she makes the strong point illicit bias is glaringly in the Justice system and shreds the idea of stereotypes with behind the scenes footage of who Jon really was. Cache' s diverse family the Heidel family all speak to their loss in the aftermath of a bias driven tragedy. The love-story is juxtaposed between college educated and upper middle class black men and boys that speak to their fear of the police when doing absolutely nothing wrong. We must have this conversation if this country is to ever be united. The Heidel family is the perfect family to deliver the message.
