Micheline is a pretty girl but rich spoiled and whimsical as well. Jacques the brother of her friend Danielle is so exasperated by her behavior that he decides to give her a chance to learn about good manners. To that effect he kidnaps her and detains her in a hut on the edge of a wood. He starts "taming the shrew" but the situation soon gets out of control when criminals - real ones this time - abduct Micheline in earnest... and for ransom!
