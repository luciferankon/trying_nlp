In Madrid the orphan sisters Irene Ana and Maite are raised by their austere aunt Paulina together with their mute and crippled grandmother after the death of their mother and their military father Anselmo. Ana is a melancholic girl fascinated by death after seeing her mother having a painful death and her father dead in bed. After the death of their parents three young girls - Irene Ana and Maite - are raised by their stern aunt Paulina and invalid grandmother. Their new world is seen through the eyes of Ana who having witnessed their mother's death is the most affected by the loss of their parents. She becomes fascinated by all things morbid and deadly. Flashbacks and flash-forwards round out little Ana's world where she often speaks to her dead mother. In the twilight of Franco's dictatorship eight-year-old Ana is convinced that she actually caused the death of her own father an uninvolved and disloyal Spanish military officer who as far as she was concerned was the sole responsible for the agonising and painful death of her mistreated young mother only a few years earlier. As a result the three orphaned and sheltered sisters Ana and her siblings Irene and Maite will be raised under the custody of their stern Aunt Paulina and their handicapped grandmother trying their best to acclimatise to the new conditions of their shared life in a caged and fragmented childhood. Eventually in a dimly-lit house tethered to the cloudy past Ana through a series of dream-like sequences mixing memories with fantasy she will develop a morbid yet comforting relationship with what seems to be a ghost in a desperate attempt to overcome life's constant impediments and in the process grow up.
