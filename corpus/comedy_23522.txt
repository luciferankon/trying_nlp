Because she had problems with a sour-tempered customer Zoé is fired from her shop assistant job.The rent as everybody knows is always due and she has no penny to her name;after a failed suicide attempt ("I did not like the smell of gas")she asks her best friend Liliane to teach her the tricks of her trade (she is a prostitute).She intends to become a kept woman but in spite of her neighbor's pieces of adviceshe neglects an American millionaire and gets into a driving-instructor's car. After a car crash she meets Jacques who is about to get married (but does not want to) ;helped by a capricious little boy they pass off as their son Jacques and Zoé pretend to have a child so that he cannot marry the angry fiancee .But the coming of an uncle who became the king of uranium in America (and probably to thank God became a Quaker)will make a difference.
