More than fifty years after the end of the war of independence a French filmmaker and an Algerian photographer take us back to the middle of the Sahara in 1962. From an irradiated desert zone to the suburbs of Algiers they follow the path of the fallout of a nuclear explosion whose dramatic remnants challenge the responsibility of nations. A film of great formal rigor about a shocking and unexplored subject.
