AT BEST DERIVATIVE: A band of fledgling criminals plan to sell the story/movie rights to a crime they have yet to commit. True crime is big nowadays. Nobody knows that better than the truest of criminals Waffle House and his band of ill-to-doers who have a plan to knock off the local bank on spec. All they need is an inside man Edwin Sage to help iron out a few of the details. Edwin an aspiring screenwriter/bank teller is happy to help especially because he thinks the group's front man is a rep from Minimax looking for creative advice on how to make a big screen robbery look "real". Everyone is blissful in their ignorance until Edwin a tinge insecure about his ability to deliver consults his cousin and head of the local anti-robbery task force Max Heavy. Oppressed by the disdain of his social circle the sheer listlessness of his existence and enough script "how-to" literary principles to fill the vault he'll probably die in Edwin is not only a failure he's an accessory. At Best Derivative is a self-conscious farce comedy that sets out to prove that it is always best to be yourself even when "yourself" is a pathetic loser with no chance at any real accomplishment.
