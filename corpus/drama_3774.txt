A young woman leaves behind the underground kink clubs of New York City and enters the world of commodified BDSM where workers are paid to embody the sexual and psychological fantasies of complete strangers. When an unscrupulous night manager asks the woman -- now working under the pseudonym Mistress Remedy -- to session with dominant clients where she is the slave for the hour she accepts. She soon realizes that her "habitual" submissiveness at home does not prepare her for the pressures and risks of this side of the sexual service industry. Should she leave? Or should she stay and prove to everyone -- including herself -- that she can handle it? A hybrid of creative biography and narrative fiction REMEDY is based on director Cheyenne Picardo's experiences working as a pro-switch in New York City. The film explores the good the bad the offensive the cruel the hysterical and the absurd aspects of commercial BDSM. It provides insight without passing judgment but only as fast as Remedy herself gets the information and no faster.
