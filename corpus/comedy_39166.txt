In every country there is a person who is the butt of all jokes. In Ireland it is Paddy in Israel it is Hymie in South Africa that person is Van der Merwe - this is his story. Set on the Van der Merwe farmstead the story centres on Van's daughter Marike who returns home from a gap year in England with her new fiancé George a British boy who is studying to become a doctor. This creates all sorts of problems and challenges for Van as he tries to come to terms with the fact that his daughter is marrying an Englishman. Van's father is strongly against this union of 'Brit and Boer' and implores Van to put an end to it. Van finds himself in a precarious situation with a difficult choice: risk the wrath of his father by condoning the wedding - or obey his father whose approval he so desperately wants and risk losing his daughter forever. When the family of the English fiancé arrives on the farm the fireworks really begin as the clash of cultures results in a number of side-splitting incidents and hilarious situations as we witness some classic Van der Merwe jokes played out in front of our eyes.
