GAMPA is one woman's story tracing the essence of her grandfather through the places and people he loved. Stretching from Adelaide to the West Australian border GAMPA takes us along the far west coast of South Australia to the birthplace of the Southern Right Whales across the Nullarbor before settling at Merdeyarra on the West Australian border. GAMPA is an uplifting Indigenous woman's story about the importance of family and the essence of places that remind us of who we are and where we come from.
