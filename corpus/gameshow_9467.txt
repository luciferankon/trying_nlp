Two teams of three members each (a contestant and two celebrities) compete to guess words in a crossword puzzle; the words all combining to lead to the identity of a famous person place thing etc. The contestant chooses a word and selects one of his teammates to guess the answer. The point value of each word depended on the round and how many letters were in the clue. If the celebrity correctly guessed the clue within a 10 second limit the contestant got to guess the puzzle's master solution; otherwise control passed to the opposing side. Either way the points were deposited into a bank and the word appeared in the appropriate space. Anywhere from five to nine clue words appeared in each puzzle all combining to lead to the master solution with the contestant guessing the puzzle and winning the dollar value of the points. Several rounds were played with point values increasing by round. The team leading when time ran out (usually three rounds) won the game and moved on to the Cross-Fire bonus round. In the 60-second Cross-Fire round the contestant would call out which clue they pay wanted and host Clark would read (rapid-fire) the clue to a crossword puzzle. Each clue was worth $100 but getting 10 of them was worth a new car or some other fabulous prize (such as a trip or fur). Two three-member teams--two celebrities and one civilian--compete against each other to fill a giant crossword puzzle. The team gets clues to each word on the board and gains points for every word it can fill in.
