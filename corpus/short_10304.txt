A solitary driver cruises the streets of Los Angeles hitting bumps and potholes every few seconds. Then suddenly he realizes he's driving on a smooth road. He pulls over and gets out to see if anything is wrong: behind him and in front of him the street is smooth. He gets back into his car puts down the convertible top and goes back and forth in drive and reverse along this rare stretch. It's relaxing; it's Nirvana in L.A.
