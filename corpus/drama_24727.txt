Nine teenagers are in Detention for a day in an inner city London secondary school. Not complete strangers to each other they are forced by the cliques they are in and their prejudices... but the rules are just begging to be broken and when the over zealous teacher goes too far they find their way out of the classroom fighting together against the system. A fast moving story of human compassion love and forgiveness which will leave the audience feeling how fun it is to be young and spontaneous!
