Jamal and Dex are two hapless out of work actors who come to terms with reality when they realize they've been pursuing their dreams for over ten years and still haven't booked a single speaking role. When the two run out of cash and face eviction from their small apartment they hit the pavement in search of a job. With no job experience no skill set and little ambition the audience gets a front row seat to this hilarious journey in which these two bad-luck prone losers can't seem to catch a break.
