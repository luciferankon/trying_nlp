One of the customs in the Breton island of St. Batiste is the lashing of any woman involved in a extra-marital affair. As a result when Sidonie ( Marie Doro ) starts an affair with English vacationer Warren Harding ( Elliott Dexter ) the townsfolk prepare to mete out punishment. To avoid it Sidonie elopes with Warren but when she finds him making love to another woman her first response is conditioned by her upbringing and she attacks the woman with a whip. Afterward Sidonie returns alone to St. Batiste and gets ready to accept her lashing. Just before her public humiliation however Warren arrives and refuses to let the whipping take place after which he pledges to remain faithful to Sidonie.
