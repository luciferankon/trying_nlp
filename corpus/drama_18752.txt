A contemporary re-imagining of Geoffrey Chaucer's "The Canterbury Tales". Dr. Lesley Hopps strains to hide an enormous debt from her husband and seeks the aid of her longtime friend David [Shipman's Tale]. Rick Fuller struggles to cope with the return of his brother Sam fresh from prison[The Pardoner's Tale]. These stories coalesce around Detectives Jeffreys and Kline as they investigate the murder of a young woman within her own home.
