Schmidt is the head of a group of spies building an arsenal along the border. Tim from the American side and Gringo from the Mexican side have been sent to investigate. But when they arrive they find the men they were to meet murdered and themselves arrested for the murders. "Arizona Gang Busters" is another pre-WWII saber-rattler that finds a band of renegade gunmen under the pretense of developing an irrigation project for the reclamation of arid desert land using airplanes and parachute jumpers to gather valuable military information for a European power. Their actions raise the suspicions of rancher Ed Lambert ('Forrest Taylor (I)' (qv)) and his daughter Sue ('Pauline Haddon' (qv)) who raise horses for the Eastern market. Sue communicates with the Commander of the American Legion post. Washington sends five federal agents and two are murdered and three vanish completely. Sue's sweetheart Sheriff Dan Kirk ('Kenne Duncan' (qv)) does not share her concerns and has no knowledge of the identity of Marshal Trigger Tim Rand ('Tim McCoy (I)' (qv)0 and his pal Lanky ('Lou Fulton' (qv)) while they work to solve what has become a national defense problem. Despite the efforts by the sheriff to arrest them Tim and Lanky with the aid of a mysterious rider known as Gringo who is really Captain Rodriguez ('Julian Rivero' (qv)) of the Mexican National Police bring to an end the subversive activities of Carl Schmidt ('Arno Frey' (qv) and Mario ('Paul Ellis (I)' (qv)).
