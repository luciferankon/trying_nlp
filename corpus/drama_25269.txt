Terrorism and chaos seem to be the order of the day. Only a few valiant and honest men stand between chaos and stability. When politicians join hands with terrorists for selfish ends there is no saying where events will take us. An innocent schoolboys life is at stake and venal politicians and corrupt policemen are only interested in safeguarding themselves. But the truth will always out. And when honest people stand up to be counted the truth will always prevail.
