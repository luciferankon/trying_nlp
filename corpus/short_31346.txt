Hiroshi Kobayashi is on the run both away from the police who want him for the murder of his girlfriend Naomi and towards the yakuza Kimura from whom he wants to exact revenge for getting her hooked on drugs. The whole film is one long chase scene shot in wild semi-abstract patterns so that you're never quite sure what you're seeing.
