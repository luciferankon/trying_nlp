Upon his arrival David notices he is being followed by several men and becomes paranoid when confronted by the men who believe he took their book bag. His life changes when a homeless veteran named Lenny saves him. Being grateful David offers him something to eat and some money - but being a man of honor Lenny declines and just wants to see David get to his new found place where he is staying with his sister Terry an aspiring dancer who works as a waitress. Knowing very little about why the men were following them they soon realize that the bag David has is full of a hundred thousand dollars in unmarked bills that belong to a known bookie named Sevalos. With Sevalos having eyes all around the city the two must form a bond and get to the proper authorities before it is too late.
