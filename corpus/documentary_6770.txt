This program presents an approach to understanding corn from different perspectives from its botanical peculiarities to the importance of its production and commercialization in the context of being the leading alimentary product in contemporary Mexico. In the program we see the double nature of corn for the ancient Mexicas for whom it was both a sacred and dietetic product and we ponder its confrontation with the European cereal par excellence: wheat. With the help of experts and specialists from multiple fields we see a vision of the nutritional value of corn and we approach the disturbing situation of the Mexican countryside in the current day. This is a profound analysis of corn a complex product that is particularly ours and it leads us to consider its significance to us as individuals as a nation as a continent and as a planet.
