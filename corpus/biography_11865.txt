Krzysztof Kamil Baczynski is one of Poland's best known poets even though he died at the age of twenty-three on the fourth day of the tragic Warsaw Uprising in 1944. Baczynski became a myth-like personification of a whole generation which died fighting for their freedom. His poetry became Poland's most poignant and subjective testimony of wartime. "Baczynski" caused controversy upon its release in Poland due to its unique form and use of poetry as a documentary device. The film examines Baczynski's motivation for becoming a soldier the inspiration for his metaphysical poetry and the prophecy of his own death. Combining recollections of the few remaining war veterans who fought with him dramatized scenes and interpretations of his poetry by today's 'slam' poets "Baczynski" is a film which resists conventional film classification to provide an experience that is as personal and varied as reading one of his poems.
