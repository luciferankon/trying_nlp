Chief Standing Rock's tribe has a treaty protecting their fishing grounds but a canning corporation is violating the treaty through intimidation and force. The tribe is divided as to how to handle the threat. Standing Rock's son Braveheart is sent to college to study law so that he can protect their rights but others in the tribe led by the hot-tempered Ki-Yote want to provoke a more violent confrontation.
