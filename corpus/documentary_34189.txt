Actor Leonard Nimoy (most well-known for his role as 'Spock' on the science-fiction series Star Trek) returns to his native city of Boston for a sentimental journey. Accompanied by his filmmaker son Adam Nimoy walks the streets sharing memories of his early years: selling newspapers near the Common sailing on the Charles and growing up in a Ukrainian immigrant family in the West End a neighborhood that was largely razed in the 1950s. Leonard Nimoy's Boston is an engrossing story of home community and urban change. Leonard Nimoy's Boston was produced as an independent half-hour special which originally aired on WGBH Boston in May 2014.
