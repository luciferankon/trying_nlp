There's more to the story of the Clintons and 9/11. Over two nights -- September 10-11 2006 just four months before Hillary announced the exploratory committee for her original presidential campaign ABC aired The Path to 9/11 a riveting and factual docudrama. This acclaimed and balanced movie faulted two administrations -- Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. But fairness was not what Hillary wanted. Screenwriter Cyrus Nowrasteh told me he had expected the customary DVD distribution. But the Clintons fearing the impact of DVD release during her campaign successfully pressured Disney which owns ABC to bury the movie.
