In the once sleepy town of "New Bedlam" a convalescing Pastor struggles to capture the attention of the burgeoning e-generation and maintain the respect of a withering elderly congregation all while fending off the beguiling Mayor's attempts to demolish the town's history and Church. In the midst a string of gruesome murders drive morale and faith to an all time low yet inexplicably "Spirits" are at an all time high. Guided by faith and guilt the Pastor and a milksop Sheriff's Deputy reluctantly lead an investigation into the evil-doings.
