Christian and Nate are relatively normal 18-year-olds. They try to balance dating and job-hunting while trying to find their place in this world. Sure they inexplicably live in a nice suburban home together they host a cigar review series on Canadian pay-per-view and they spend a disproportionate amount of time at the arcade but who doesn't do that? Yeah Nate likes to play video games with unconscious girls and Christian needs to request extra napkins before his food even arrives but are you really going to dwell on that? And yes the entirety of their life is lived in 3-minute bits. So what? You could almost say that their lives are like a...SketchShow.
