The Queen of Sheba falls in love with the King of Israel. The King of Israel however is in love with someone else. The Queen royally ticked off invades Israel. King Solomon (Gino Cervi) sends his son Rehoboam (Gino Leurini)on a spy mission to Sheba where he falls in love with the lucious Queen (Leonora Buffo) and tries to prevent a war between their two countries in this bottom-of-the-barrel Italian film reinforced by the fact that the English-dubbed version was distributed by William M. Pizor the King of Schlock. There are some court intrigues and counter-intrigues and the Queen gets all out of sorts when she thinks her lover has betrayed her and leads her army in an assault against Jerusalem.
