Through the Mirror is a haunting and outlandish magic realism art/dance film... an attempt to go beyond the image we carry of ourselves beyond our limited perception of who we truly are; or more precisely daring to go through the looking glass and the refusal of facing our own inner prisons. "Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy - the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light."
