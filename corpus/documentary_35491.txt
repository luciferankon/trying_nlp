Despite repeated warnings by KRG president Barzani to Maliki regarding the terrorists intention to invade Mosul Maliki paid no heed thus in June of 2014 the Islamic State terrorists overran the fragile Iraqi army taking over their state of the art weapons and conquered Mosul. This was to be followed by the move to attack Kurdistan during which time they reeked havoc and slaughtered civilians indiscriminately taking great many Yazidi Kurds and Christian women as war booties where most still remain in captivity. This film chronicles the Peshmerga's courageous fight as they attack and defeat ISIS on all fronts including the liberation of Mount Sinjar where 8000 Yezidis were stranded. The Peshmerga managed to turn the tables on ISIS despite lacking heavy weapons and despite Baghdad's arms embargo on Kurdistan. The Peshmerga became the only boots on the ground to defend their nation and the world at large.
