Frankie is a story about a young boy but it is everyone's story too because at least once in our life we felt we did not fit in. Frankie spends his time studying chess theory and reading books because he doesn't play much with the other kids. Joe is a cheerful elderly man that often plays chess and listens to his radio in the park. One day Frankie is getting picked on by some older boys and while running away he meets Joe. The two form a friendship over chess and books.
