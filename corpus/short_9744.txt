On a hot summer afternoon a teenager finds a stray dog in a local park. He decides to take the dog back to its owner. A fat black woman half drunk opens the door and asks him in by way of thanks. They sit down in the living room. The young man feels very ill-at-ease. The lady gives him a large glass of alcohol he now has to drink with her.
