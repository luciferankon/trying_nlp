According to legend the Dark Dragon will return to the world of Rune 1000 years after being banished to an alternate dimension. He will defy the powers of the Light and lead the powers of Darkness into a bitter war for complete control of each kingdom! Of course this prophecy was long ago and many have forgotten it. Had it not been recorded in the Great Book of Ancient Lore housed within the royal library of Guardiana it would have probably been lost in the passage of time. Now the once peaceful kingdom of Runefaust has been assaulting the surrounding kingdoms of Rune! Word has it that King Ramladu is being influenced by a dark presence: the great wizard Darksol.
