Ten-year-old Maeve Coughlan was an unusual and gifted child. She was born in Ireland and died in a pedestrian accident whilst on a cycling trip in South East Queensland in November 2003. This event and her family's decision to document their story are the foundation of After Maeve a 52 minute documentary that explores the most painful experience that can befall a parent - the loss of a child.
