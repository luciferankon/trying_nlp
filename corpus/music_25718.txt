Nirvana headlining at Reading in 1992 was something you had to see and if you didn't see it then it was something you pretended you saw. --Kerrang (October 2003) "The staggering energy and intensity radiating from the stage never let up... Cobain's ravaged pop songs coming off like some dream marriage of the Sex Pistols and the Beatles borne on bracing waves of distorted guitar noise." --Rolling Stone (October 29 1992) Ranked #1 in Kerrang Magazine's "100 Gigs That Shook The World" and voted as "Nirvana's #1 Greatest Moment" by fans in an NME poll Nirvana's historic August 30 1992 stands as a watershed moment in the history of rock. While the show's centerpiece was a performance of nearly the entire Nevermind tracklist also noteworthy were early performances of three as yet unrecorded songs which wouldn't be released until 2 years later on In Utero: "All Apologies" "Dumb" and in its first ever public performance "Tourettes." The career-spanning setlist also reached back to the band's 1989 Sub Pop debut album Bleach for "Blew" "About A Girl" "School" "Negative Creep" and first single "Love Buzz" and even further back to the mid-'80s for "Spank Thru." Other songs from the Reading set would appear in studio form on the Incesticide compilation later in the year: "Aneurysm" "Been A Son" and "Sliver." Additionally the band played a pair of beloved covers by two bands that helped shape the formative Nirvana sound- "The Money Will Roll Right In" by Fang and "D-7" by The Wipers. SET LIST: 1. Breed 2.
