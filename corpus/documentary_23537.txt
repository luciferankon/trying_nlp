Beautifully filmed in Canada and China's Guangdong province From C to C is a moving cinematic tapestry of Chinese Canadian stories of migration. Contrasting the historical injustices faced by Chinese migrants to Canada and their families over the last century are the experiences of contemporary Chinese Canadian youth who embody diverse transnational identities across Canada today. Beautifully filmed in Canada and China's Guangdong province 'From C to C' is a moving and cinematic tapestry of stories of migration. These stories outline the injustices faced by Chinese migrants to Canada during the last century and the little known affects of migration on the families and communities of migrants. The film contrasts these histories with the views and experiences of contemporary Chinese Canadian youth leading us to reflect on the meaning of legislative exclusion for those who experienced it as well as for those who did not. By calling attention to the diverse and transnational nature of contemporary Chinese Canadian identities the film promotes an inclusive vision of Canada that values members of all communities as global-rather than solely national-citizens.
