Substantivo Feminino is a documentary that recalls the history of two women who became pioneers in environmental activism in Brazil and the world. Giselda Castro and Magda Renner were both housewives from wealthy families in Southern Brazil when they began to advocate for the poor in 1964. As a result they gained international recognition and their regional organization Ga√∫cha Democratic Feminine Action League (ADFG) eventually moved on to other causes and became the first and only branch of Friends of the Earth in Brazil an international federation that has offices in more than 70 countries. From that moment on they traveled the world to conferences and meetings integrating with international organizations concerned with the environment and the World Bank NGO Committee. During filming the production team discovered that they were being monitored by the National Service of Information - SNI an department of the military regime.
