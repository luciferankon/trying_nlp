Every single one of us can relate to the search for happiness but happiness can take on many forms. Danish director Ole Bendtzen takes us on a trip to Bhutan a Himalayan outpost with it's own unique relationship to happiness. We meet a man with three wives monks with cell phones and the leader of Bhutan's own ministry dedicated to happiness - The Gross National Happiness Commission. Let there be no doubt the Bhutanese take happiness very seriously!
