Six scenes with loose slim or no connection: (1) While backpacking through Big Bear hikers John Davenport and Lyndon spot Kevin (a self-squeezing dude who's psychologically unable to keep his pants either up or down for more than a couple minute while playing with himself around a waterfall). (2) Camping for the night John (thinking of Kevin) tries to crank one out. When Lyndon awakens the boys get curious about each other with John manipulating Lyndon out and topping him. (3) John's now back home. Roommate/buddy Mike returns from his own trip relaying a tale of seeing a guy at the Y enjoying himself. As Mike showers (alone) John D. falls asleep dreaming he's the guy at the Y with buddy Mike topping him. (4) Bashful Steve enters a gym sauna nervously finding Kevin inside in quite an unmindful immodest state. Without much fanfare Kevin has his way with Steve. (5) As Todd tries to clean the public shower Tony rudely insists on using it while playing around with John Tanner. Tensions mount a fight breaks out and Tony wrestles Todd to the shower floor where he and John T both aggressively "enjoy" him. (6) Eric enjoys himself alone in his bed.
