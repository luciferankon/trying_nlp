In this latest episode of the sexually explicit "Dynastud" TV series Steven and Adam the idle rich Harrington boys of Beverly Hills live to satisfy their carnal fancies but business is business. With Truck Johnson Drillco's field manager arriving by plane Mrs. Harrington phones her two decadent sons. Due to limo trouble she directs Steven to fetch Truck from the airport. He reluctantly agrees but shortly thereafter loses all sense of time upon meeting the family's hot new stable boy immediately deciding to check out the full measure of him there and then and at leisure. Meanwhile Adam en route to Hawaii in a private plane packed with party guests fails to receive Mother's message to return home for Truck's welcoming party. The pilot investigating the problem leaves the cockpit to discover Adam in the private back room having a hot and heavy encounter with guest Brian. Unable to tear himself away the airman disrobes eventually (and vigorously) joining them. At the mansion Truck finally arrives (prompting the balding butler to indulge in a private fantasy after seeing Truck to his room). When Steven finally arrives (straight home from the darkened airport) he meets Truck at the pool and the two make a special connection.
