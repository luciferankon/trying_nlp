Early Sunday morning Kristien fixes her parents' breakfast to get back in her mother's good graces. She waves to the family dog outside (and tosses him a steak from the refrigerator) decorates place mats and makes coffee. She puts the silver serving pot directly on the burner so by the time mom and dad wake the pot has melted. Mom goes ballistic and dad cowers before this anger. Next day mom takes Kristien to a boarding school. Kristien bolts returning home late that night to frantic parents. Mom hugs Kristien vows not to lose her temper again and opens the refrigerator to get the steak for a celebratory dinner. What will happen when mom discovers who ate it?
