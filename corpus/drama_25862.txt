The title of this movie "Yellow Black" represents the school colors of Istanbul Sultanisi (Istanbul High School). In 1914 the buildings of the Saint Benoit High School were assigned to the Istanbul Sultanisi. With the beginning of World War I some parts of the buildings were converted into a hospital and as it was customary at the time the building was painted yellow as a sign of hope. In 1915 the school had no graduates. When all the 50 senior students who volunteered for the Ottoman Army fell during the Battle of Gallipoli at Kabatepe on May 19 1915 at 3:30 am the remaining students painted all the windows and the doors of the school in black in commemoration. This movie tells their story.
