This was a second pilot attempt for a potential series based on the many faces of love. It presented two one-act plays: "The Interview" is a verbal sparring match between an egotistical movie director and a probing TV commentator; and "Margie Passes" is a lighthearted tale about an effervescent teenage girl with an everlasting effect on people.
