A 72-year-old grandmother dies and finds herself on a ferry which will take her across the river to the hereafter. On the ferryboat she meets her first love who was killed in a road accident in which they were both involved when they were young. She is presented with a fateful choice: to start life afresh as a 22-year-old - her age at the time of the accident - and to relinquish all her memories of the life she has lived with her husband and children; or to remain a 72-year-old woman with all her life's memories intact. If she chooses the second alternative she will get off the boat when it reaches its destination and will never be truly reunited with her beloved who has been waiting for her on the ferryboat for fifty long years.
