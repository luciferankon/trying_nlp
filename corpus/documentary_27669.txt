'Stephen Spielberg' 'Ridley Scott' (qv) 'James Cameron (I)' (qv) and 'George Lucas (I)' (qv) discuss the importance of science fiction films and the influence of the genre. Following the end of World War II new kinds of enemies appeared those that could not be seen such as the atom or the fear of the unknown such as that resulting from the cold war. Movies became metaphors for those fears and science fiction films took many forms. They include giant bugs such as the ants in _Them! (1954)_ (qv) or inanimate object such as in _The Monolith Monsters (1957)_ (qv). In _The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957)_ (qv) the terror comes from everyday life - a cat a spider - as the man gets smaller and smaller. Science fiction involving space travel required more imagination. _Destination Moon (1950)_ (qv) and _Rocketship X-M (1950)_ (qv) were early attempts at taking a serious look at space flight and its implications. Then there were encounters with aliens some benign such as Klaatu from _The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)_ (qv) or aggressive aliens as terrorist or a danger to humankind such as in _Invaders from Mars (1953)_ (qv) or _The War of the Worlds (1953)_ (qv).
