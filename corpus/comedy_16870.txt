A comedy about the unlikely friendship that kindles between a struggling stand-up comedian from L.A. forced to move back home to Eastern Long Island with his tail between his legs and a tragically flawed but charming and charismatic alcoholic dermatologist. Discovering to be kindred spirits each helps the other find healing in addition to the confidence to face the "failures" in their lives.
