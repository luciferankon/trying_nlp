In 1972 a photograph is shot showing the nine-year-old Vietnamese woman Kim Phúc who is running around naked with a pain-distorted face. In an attempt to escape a napalm attack she suffers severe burns. It is June 8 1972. A cruel war is raging in Vietnam. Kim Phúc is looking for protection with her family in a temple as an attack on the small village of Tran Bang begins. Shortly thereafter the temple is to be bombed.
