Isaac and Hugo are friends whom after attending a Day of the Dead celebration are involved in a car accident that shatters their lives. Five years later Isaac is in Mexico to get a large Virgin Mary statue blessed. Hugo however is in trouble with a Mexican drug cartel and must carry drugs across the border to a town named Santo Paseo. Their paths cross in Mexico and on their way to the U.S. Hugo hides the drugs in hopes that Isaac will unknowingly help him bring them across the border. With the southwestern US serving as a backdrop the story takes them through a series of stops that serve to bring back memories and test the friendship that was torn apart five years before.
