100 years ago it was the outskirts of Milwaukee. In the subsequent 50 years a surge of industrial development created the 880 acres that we now call the 30th Street Industrial Corridor. This boom also created neighborhoods-communities built around an economic engine fueled by manufacturing and industry. In the last 40 years deindustrialization has ravaged the area. Companies and jobs moved overseas and to Milwaukee's outlying suburbs. Today the future of the 30th Street Industrial Corridor feels as uncertain as it was 100 years ago.
