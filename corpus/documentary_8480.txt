The migration of Mexicans to the United States is a phenomenon that is already more than a century old. Although in the last few years the Mexican government has created programs that attempt to defend and protect the thousands of Mexicans who cross the border daily in search of better living conditions the number of deaths in the swath of land around the border has risen considerably. Throughout the twentieth century life stories are repeated just as the one presented to us in this program by Don Beto Romero.
