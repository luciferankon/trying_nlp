16 years old Kate's world is shattered when her father is convicted of murder. Together with her mother and younger sister they move to another town to live with a reluctant aunt. They begin at a new school where highly strung 'Liz' rules the roost and strongly objects to anybody who she sees as a rival. Liz determines to cause Kate as much trouble as possible especially as she fears Kate has caught the attention of the school's footballing hero Pete. How matters resolve themselves makes for an exciting and fascinating storyline. The film has its fair share of comedy drama and action and should be of interest to a wide audience both old and young. The film also deals with important and relevant issues such as bullying and the loss of a parent. 'Days' is an original screenplay written by Penketh's own Graeme Baxter. It is a film about youth about those feelings and events that young people go through in that special period of first encounters and experiences concerned with physical and social development. It is a story of jealousy rivalry bullying and crime and has its fair share of football to boot.
