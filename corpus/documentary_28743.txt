Black Diamond is a name used in Japan for bluefin tuna. It is an essential fish in Japanese cuisine. However fishermen in Japan are alarming us that bluefins has vanished. They believe that this is because of big companies catching them with purse seine in the spawning season. Although demonstration has been made in front of the Fisheries Agency and bluefins being categorized as vulnerable endangered species no change can be seen in the big companies' catches. Moreover Japanese media does not report the nature of this issue and neither the government nor the politicians are taking action towards restriction to the purse seine fisheries. There are voices raised from outside Japan. Even though the U.S. proposes a strict international management the Japanese government tolerates it as an absurd proposal. Japanese without no knowledge of what's going on continues to keep on eating the precious black diamond.
