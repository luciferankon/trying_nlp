Inside a flat in a residential building a young pianist plays one of the Six Little Preludes for Beginners by J.S.Bach. After the completion of the musical piece we are successively transported into five adjacent flats where the sound of the piano has simultaneously penetrated. In each one of these spaces we meet a single occupant in a characteristic solitary activity which unfolds during the exact same time frame as the performance of the prelude and sends its own acoustic mark to the neighboring spaces. The five isolated private monologues become thus interrelated. Through these common sound marks they are orchestrated into one unified text with variations founded on the melodic structure of the prelude.
