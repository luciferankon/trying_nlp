Inspired by a true account "THE MALEDICTION OF RODEO ROAD" concerns the story of a young professional couple who lease a residential property in Palm Springs California only to discover it has had a most troubled history including a demonic possession/exorcism and the site of a grisly multiple homicide some years before. A series of strange and bizarre paranormal incidents occur which indicates the presence of a supernatural entity in their new home. Meanwhile a collection of 8mm home movies are discovered in the attic of the residence depicting the horrendous demonic possession/exorcism of a former occupant in the house. As a sub plot to the story Jesuit priests at a nearby Catholic church are seen as a possible bulwark against the growing demonic malediction in the residence although there is evidence of a Satanic cult at work behind-the-scenes as brutal black mass type homicides are uncovered by law enforcement in Palm Springs. Eventually the demonic influence in the house takes hold of first the young couple's child then his father until finally the Jesuit priests decide to perform an exorcism where they are both freed from the clutches of the 'noonday devil' but at a great cost. With the possession and exorcism over it appears all is well with the world again. But is it?
