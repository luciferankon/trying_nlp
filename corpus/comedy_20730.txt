The Fellowship of the farmers is an absurd romantic rural comedy mixing elements of occultism horror bizarre folklore and extreme moonshine-idealization with french decadence and jet-set life. The story begins with the son of mythical horny Santa Claus-like creature determined to avenge his father killed by the farmers for seducing their milkmaids and he fools the megalomaniacal moonshine-king Mjolkior playing on the former honorable farmer's vanity luring the unsuspecting peasants down to the French Riviera - a culture so alien and sophisticated - that no farmers have survived there longer than 48 hours.
