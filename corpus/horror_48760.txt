The film follows the story of Elliot who awakes with no memory of the last three months of his life. On returning to the village where he grew up and currently believes he lives he slowly realises that his former life has been erased and his new life is one of continual nightmares and visitations from the unknown. On being confronted by an unnamed man only known as The Collector Elliot begins to question whether he can believe anyone or anything he is told or even believe himself.
