This unique and thought-provoking documentary delves into the conflict between the art and business of filmmaking as it is enacted on the "battlefield" of Hollywood. Through a series of interviews with people working in all aspects of the movie industry - from films with budgets ranging from $20000 to multi-million dollar projects to people who are struggling to become a "player" in the business Swiss writer/director Michael Beltrami takes an incisive hard-hitting look at a medium where artistic vision must often conform to the dictates of business.
