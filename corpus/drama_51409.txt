Blackeyes is an attempt to explore "what does go on between men and women in their heads to show the possibilities of the ways that they see each other." Complex and multi-layered the interweaving narrative threads include novelist Maurice James Kingsley who appropriates accounts by his niece Jessica about her life as a professional model. Kingsley's embellishments become a trashy bestseller "Sugar Bush" tracing the rise and decline of fictional fashion model Blackeyes victimized by men. Angry and betrayed Jessica begins to rewrite Kingsley's novel to set Blackeyes free from the abuse of men.
