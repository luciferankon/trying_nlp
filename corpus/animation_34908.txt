It's the first day of Summer Vacation and The Cat in the Hat whisks Nick Sally and Fish off on the greatest great outdoor camping adventure ever! Our gang gets back to nature as they hike through the Fickle Fern Forest camp out overnight trek over Mt. Weewobble and canoe down the Tickle Drop River....just in time for Fish to meet up with his family for a grand reunion. Along for the ride are Little Cats A B and C who discover there's wonder in nature once their electronic devices are powered off! Nick and Sally help keep the Little Cats out of trouble while Fish tries to keep his jacket pressed and the mud out of his fancy fishbowl...all while getting up close to some of nature's most awesome sights and learning how best to respect them. After being lulled to sleep under the stars by a chorus of animals the morning brings fresh adventure with a spectacular race up Mt. Weewobble complete with a cliffhanger ending! It's a slippery ride down the slope and into the Tickle Drop River where a harrowing raft ride finally delivers them to the shores of Fish's family reunion. The Cat in the Hat and his lovable Little Cat cousins Nick Sally Fish and all his family gather together in a great Suessian-style musical finale... in which Fish and the gang are celebrated as true adventurers. Everyone agrees it really has been the Greatest Great Outdoors Adventure Ever!
