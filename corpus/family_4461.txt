The Beverly Hillbillies is a classic American comedy series that originally aired for nine seasons from 1962 to 1971 and was the first television series to feature a "fish out of water" genre. The series was about the Clampett family - widower Jed "J.D." (Buddy Ebsen); his mother-in-law Daisy May "Granny" Moses (Irene Ryan); beautiful but tomboyish daughter Elly May (Donna Douglas); and nephew Jethro (Max Baer Jr.) - that moves to ritzy Beverly Hills California after striking oil on the family's Texas country farm.
