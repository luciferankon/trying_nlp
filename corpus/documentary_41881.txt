Since 1933 The Hackberry Ramblers have played a toe-tapping blend of Cajun music and western swing. Amazingly the band's co-founders--fiddler Luderin Darbone and accordionist Edwin Duhon--are still leading the band today. Equal parts biography social history and Spinal Tap road movie 'Make 'Em Dance' tells the story of the band's seventy-year odyssey.
