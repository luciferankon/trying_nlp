Obesity is a growing epidemic in this country. Nutrition starts at home and it has to start as early as possible. Kid's Cafe will showcase really cool and healthy treats and meals your kids can make at home with adult supervision. Our adult host will guide our two kid-size guests through the process of making the meal of the day along with cool healthy treats snacks and smoothies. Each segment focuses on local organic sustainable foods (including a trip to the super market fresh markets and farms) that you can find close to home and what it means to choose local and organic products. We also include an animated segment on conversions (what is a tablespoon? What is a portion?) and in future episodes recycling with our resident cartoon character Recycle Michael.
