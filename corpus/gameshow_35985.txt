Tawdry remake of the 1979 Chuck Barris cult classic game show "Three's a Crowd." Three sets of three contestants competed each having a central contestant and two companions (e.g. a current boy/girlfriend and an ex-boy/girlfriend). With the companions off-stage host Thicke posed a (usually embarrassing) question to the central contestant. Points were scored depending on whether one or both of the contestant's companions matched answers. After a series of questions came the end game where Thicke posed multiple-choice personality trait-type questions to one team at a time; separately each companion selected one of three possible answers. A match earned points. The leading companion at the end of the round won a $1000 bonus (and usually eternal embarrassment).
