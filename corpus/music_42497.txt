Former Jethro Tull guitarist Martin Barre leads his own band (vocalist-guitarist Dan Crisp bassist-backing vocalist Alan Thomson and drummer Jonathan Joseph) through two sets of Tull classics (including "Minstrel in the Gallery" "Thick as a Brick" "Skating Away" and "Locomotive Breath" covers (notably two Beatles masterpieces) and his own new songs (from his solo album "Back to Steel") at Martyrs' nightclub in Chicago during late April 2017. In amazing physical shape at 70 years old Barre demonstrates the impressive combination of technique versatility and passion for which he has always been known. Partially shot on his 40th wedding anniversary the production also includes glimpses of his wife Julie as well as his friends Brian O'Malley and filmmaker Scott Allen Nollen who also wrote the book "Jethro Tull: A History of the Band 1968-2001." written with the participation of Ian Anderson and other former band members bassist David Pegg drummer Doane Perry and the late Glenn Cornick the bassist for the original 1968 lineup.
