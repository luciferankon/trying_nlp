Shan a 2nd grader of Junior high school and Jia who is in 3rd grade of elementary school. They are brothers who love baseball games. Pei-Lin Shan's crush is going to move away very soon. Therefore before her departure they made a promise of exchanging their favorite signed baseballs. In the meanwhile Jia is on a field trip at the Metropolitan Park but unluckily lost his brother's QiaQia signed ball. For his crime Jia encourages his disheartened brother to search for the ball with him at the Faraway park. The next morning they ride a bike to the park and begin the operation. Yet they have to arrive at school around sunset. Although there are many bloopers along on the road Shan still tries to reach their goal like what he told to Jia -"Keep going and we'll be there."
