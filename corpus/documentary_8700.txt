Screw The Vote is a satirical look at why Canada's youth does not vote in the Federal elections. It follows host Jian Ghomeshi as he travels across Canada interviewing politicians musicians actors and ordinary people- mainly the youth of Canada- asking them why the youth should bother voting. Instead of encouraging young people to vote he tells them to screw the vote and let others decide their future for them. What was intended to be a humourous satire becomes rather serious though as we learn the real reasons for youth apathy in this country.
