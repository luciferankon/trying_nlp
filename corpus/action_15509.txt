Sydney Davenport and Jo-Jo Ritter had one dream since they were able to pick up a crayon. Become the worlds best fighter pilots. Problem is they are both females. In today's world females are now permitted to fly combat aircraft This was not the case in the 1940's. In today's military service it can still be very tough for a woman . And even tougher for a lesbian couple. Straight out of AFROTC Jo-Jo and Sydney will get a shot at a lifetime. Flying the F-16 for our country is right around the corner. However when the obstacles they encounter become to overbearing the ultimate dream slowly seems to be the ultimate nightmare. When both girls miraculously obtain "pilot slots" and an invitation to train at the WASPS Academy they are about to embark on a journey that neither themselves nor their country saw coming. Thrown into the middle of a war on what was supposed to be a training exercise the girls will have to rely on the same skills that women were taught in the 1940's. Flying only. How can they save this country today with no weapons on board. In honor of the women who made this very dream possible. Sydney and Jo-Jo will take you on the edge of your seat at Mach One in honor of The Wasps.
