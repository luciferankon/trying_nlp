Hong Kong the 3rd biggest financial centre in the world is also a place with distorted living environment (and values). A story about 4 'losers' living in the infamous 'coffin' room have their own issues. Four sad stories with sugar coating entertaining the audience for 100 minutes. A cult movie nicely directed and plotted. You can just consume the sugar or savour the hidden bitterness.
