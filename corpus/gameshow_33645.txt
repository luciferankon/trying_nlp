There are three rounds to the game with a total of eight questions and each episode is self-contained. A team of four players starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each player must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must touch the center blue triangle simultaneously to lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they are wrong or if time runs out their bank is reduced by half. (Unlike the original British series the team is not eliminated for accumulating multiple incorrect answers.)
