Back from Jamaica a suburban slacker promises his girlfriend that he is finally ready to put his weed habit behind him... just not yet. True to form he calls his friends to smoke with him only to lose sight of the weed. Now their desperate yet lazy search for weed leads them to a pimp a drug dealer and a hustler. Meanwhile the guys are befuddled by a downstairs roommate who is as crazy about exercise as they are about marijuana. With little money so-so wit but lots of heart these friends may yet learn that weed is not the only purpose in life... though it may just be the most satisfying one.
