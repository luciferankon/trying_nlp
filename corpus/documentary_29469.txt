The Forgotten Army tells the story of former GDR elite soldiers who after the Berlin Wall fell haven't come to terms with their past. Divided between radicals and legalists they are unable to find a new identity in reunited Germany. Since 1989 more than 250000 border guards high officers of the National People's Army and "Stasi" officers not only lost their jobs but also their homeland and their identities. They all did what they were told to do confident that it was the right thing. Nonetheless they were in a dilemma: being faithful to their oath also meant to spy on their neighbours and - as a last consequence - shoot at their own people trying to escape to the West. "The Forgotten Army" tells the story of former GDR (German Democratic Republic) soldiers who nearly 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall still struggle with the loss of their homeland. Since 1989 more than 250000 border guards high officers of the National People's Army and Stasi officers not only lost their jobs but also their homeland and their identities. These men all did what they were told to do confident that it was the right thing. Nonetheless they were in a dilemma: being faithful to their oath also meant to spy on their neighbours and - as a last consequence - shoot at their own people trying to escape to the West. Divided between radicals and legalists they are unable to adopt with the re-unified Germany but keep practicing their former military rituals embedded in the command structure of an army that doesn't exist anymore.
