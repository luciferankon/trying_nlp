Unseen Victims depicts life for an American Muslim family before and after 9/11. Mike has to deal with being alienated as an outsider who is no longer viewed as an American. He eventually realizes that the religion he had been trying to distance himself from in order to fit in is rather the key to helping him find out who he really is.
