Made in the 1970s a time when South Africans were constantly being reminded about the communist onslaught this features Hank (originally English-speaking) and Hennery (Afrikaans-speaking) two very laid-back secret agents who together with a black colleague (Vriend) manage to foil a terrorist plot to take over the country. They are introduced as beach bums and for at least the first half the film comes across as a not very good buddy movie. For much of the time we're not too certain of just who they are and from whom they get their orders though once in a while they speak to someone in Pretoria. On the way into the mountains of Lesotho they pick up a girl (a communist agent who switches sides without any qualms when she falls in love with Hennery). The unlikely baddies are an Afrikaans-speaking group of communists disguised as members of a monastic order. Interestingly the agents' black comrade is treated throughout as an equal and the race question doesn't really come into it.
