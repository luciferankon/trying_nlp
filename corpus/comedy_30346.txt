At the Presidential Mansion news arrives every day indicating that things in the country are going from bad to worse. The President summons all the political leaders in order to understand exactly what is happening; and yet no one can enlighten him. He decides to act. He calls two journalists and assigns them the task of investigating the matter by speaking directly with ordinary people. The investigation starts with the notorious Gypsy Tamtakos who struggles every day for a living. Then they move on to a simple employee Markos who dreams of a raise -which never comes. Then it's a farmer Thymios who comes to the capital to sell his oranges. In a largely burlesque manner the film more or less reveals that the entire misfortune is due to Greeks' laziness and apathy as well as to the prevailing attitude of "no big deal".
