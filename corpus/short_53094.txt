This documentary consists of footage that shows Fincher as he critiques some of the pre-vis material created for the film. It also lets us see some subsequent revisions to those shots. Fincher speaks frequently of his use of pre-vis in his commentary so this feature helps give us a good visual sense for what he meant. It's a nice slice of this process and Fincher's input.
