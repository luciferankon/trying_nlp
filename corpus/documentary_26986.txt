In 1997 just prior to his departure from politics President Nelson Mandela delivered an informal speech to a predominately mixed-race Coloured community in the Western Cape. He reassured them they had nothing to fear from the ANC government once he left office... that his dream of a free and equal society for all South Africa's citizens would continue in the hearts and minds of his successors. Now twenty years later and facing the threat of a forced migration from their ancestral homelands Word of Honour: Reclaiming Mandela's Promise illuminates the story of a people questioning the fate of their Coloured identity in the new South Africa. From the Director of the award winning historical documentary I'm Not Black I'm Coloured: Identity Crisis at the Cape of Good Hope Kiersten Dunbar Chace blends poetry landscape imagery and rare archive footage with a collection of powerful indigenous voices who share their insight and experience regarding the issues facing their respective communities. Presented as regional vignettes Word of Honour is an introspective look into South Africa's young democracy as well as a meditation on what may be looming on the horizon. In order to weave this rich tapestry of post-apartheid conversations Chace traveled 5000 miles across South Africa with an all-South African crew to the townships of Cape Town Durban Port Elizabeth Johannesburg and the rural desert village of Riemvasmaak. Cast members include retired High Court Judge Chris Greenland photojournalist and HipHop promoter Rushay Booysen former ANC freedom fighter Danny Brown poet Khadijah Heeger comedian and founder of Bruin-Ou.com Charles Ash elder Anna Davids community activist Jerome Lottering and Elsie's River resident Chantay Haynes.
