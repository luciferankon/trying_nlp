During a ten-hour period in January 1995 porn actress Annabel Chong (1972- ) had sex with 251 men in front of cameras. The resulting video sold more than 40000 copies (she was never paid the agreed-upon $10000). This documentary tells the story of that day and connects it to Chong's life as a student at USC and as the daughter of a middle-class Chinese couple in Singapore. Annabel talks to the camera about her decisions; the camera also follows her to an AIDS test after the world-record-setting sex fest and home to Singapore where she visits her parents who do not know about her profession and friends and professors who do. Should she tell her mother?
