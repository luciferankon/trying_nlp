In 1976 the filmmaker's father Jonas Mekas made a film called Paradise Not Yet Lost. Many scenes in the film were street scenes of Soho New York City from 1967-75. Twenty years later the filmmaker creates a record of Soho from the 60s 70s & 90s revisiting the neighborhood with her video camera and juxtaposing images from Mr. Mekas' 1976 film.
