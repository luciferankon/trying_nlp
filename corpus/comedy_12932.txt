Jalli operates the switchboard in an ad agency owned by his relative Kalevi Riivatsalo (who sees strange nightmares about Pippi Longstocking because of Jalli). The pay is so low he has to invent oddball side businesses with his friend Jaska. Jalli dates gorgeous blonde Irmeli but considers her too poor for him so he switches to Marjut daughter of one of Finland's 20 wealthiest families. Love and money mostly money mix into a chaotic plot.
