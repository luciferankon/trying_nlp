Ungraduated law student Folta ('Karel Höger' (qv)) now a driver at a soda works offers successful legal guidance. He gives good advice to the butcher Pejsa ('Ilja Prachar' (qv)) who is facing charges of stealing pork. In return Pejsa invites him to his home for a treat of stolen pork meat. Together they watch the TV contest and Folta recognizes one of the contestants a millionaire. It is Drtílek ('Cestmír Randa (I)' (qv)) a man who made a lot of money by fraud after the war. The man now hides his ill-gotten gains waiting for an opportunity to make use of his money. Folta has an idea about how to get hold of at least half of Drtílek's money. He hires his ex-clients and they all pay a visit to the fraud.
