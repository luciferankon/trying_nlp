His wife Lauren a part-time realtor has her hands full home-schooling their autistic son Justin. Life is tough but it's good... until their run-in with the neighbors. The Bickfords Jason twenty and Garret eighteen are the "bad seeds" of the block. Whether it's dealing drugs or handing out beatings the brothers are always at the center. Their sidekick Ackerman a mid-twenties biker creates a fearsome threesome. Only their younger brother known lovingly as Booger has a semblance of a normal social life. He and Tobin are good friends to the chagrin of both families. A minor accident and a strange coincidence culminate in events that alter the lives of both families forever.
