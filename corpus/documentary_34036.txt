In 1986 Juris Podnieks the outstanding Latvian filmmaker made "Is It Easy To Be Young?" where he held conversations "on equal ground" with young people who had taken their first independent steps in life. The problems they confronted were of a new nature for Soviet society then. The aim of this film after 20 years is to discover what happened to this rebellious generation. Through their stories we see life in Latvia after 20 years of independence. How have their lives thoughts and attitudes changed? What do they think of life today?
