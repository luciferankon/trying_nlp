A meditation on the nature of memory loss and the allure of decay "Objects Also Die" is a visual evocation of the Los Angeles landmark Ambassador Hotel seen through the prism of its abandoned and shuttered phase. In its final days the Ambassador bordered on a mirage. So improbable was a deserted complex that massive right on Wilshire Boulevard slowly being defeated by time and neglect. In all its leaky broken-down glory it was great. In 2006 the L.A. Unified School District demolished the Ambassador. What once seemed so permanent is now gone forever but what is lost can be appreciated on its own profoundly unknowable terms. This film examines these terms the transience of human endeavor and the importance of "letting objects die."
