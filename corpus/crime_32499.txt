Three Swedish financiers are murdered over three consecutive nights. Evidence suggests that the killings will continue and the world of finance is panicked. The police quickly set up a special unit under the leadership of Detective Jenny Hultin. She hand picks six police officers from across the country and they form the so-called A-group. Under enormous pressure they attempt to solve the case before more finance officers are murdered.
