Divided We Fall is the first film about the 2011 Wisconsin Uprising to present a critical perspective on the movement that inspired workers around the world yet failed to achieve its most urgent objective - defeating Governor Scott Walker's signature union busting and austerity legislation. Divided We Fall traces the genesis of the historic capitol occupation and weeks-long protests from the perspective of graduate teaching assistants at the center of the action - and exposes the tensions that challenged the movement's solidarity. The combination of dramatic citizen-produced video and original in-depth interviews with labor leaders scholars and pundits creates an extraordinary and compelling narrative of resistance that will resonate with emerging movements challenging the Trump agenda.
