Uncover the story of perhaps the most horrific chapter of the Holocaust - the two year killing frenzy of the Einsatzgruppen. Sift through the evidence left behind: photographs and one rare film that documented the inhuman attempts to carry out Hitler's Final Solution. Compared to what the Einsatzgruppen did on a daily basis the killing chambers of Auschwitz almost seem humane. This terrible story is brought to life in one town that stands in for Einsatzgruppen's countless victims - one community where the faces and stories of the victims miraculously survived - although the men woman and children behind the images did not.
