Sean 'Baby Face' Banes is a former light-weight boxing champion. Born in the projects he learned the rules quickly - be the predator or be the prey. This attitude led him to ascend to boxing ranks quickly. Banes' rise to the top was marred by an abrupt halt when a freak punch - right hook jab - left him declared legally blind. His world quickly crumbles and only his trainer Tony 'Tubs' Ricardo and his devoted loving wife Amanda stay by his side. Banes' seemingly last and only chance for redemption comes by way of a lucrative rematch.
