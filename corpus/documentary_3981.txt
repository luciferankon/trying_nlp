Internationally known as the "Garden or pearl of the Atlantic" the Island of Madeira is less visited underwater where aquatic flowers and colourful animals replace their terrestrial counterparts. Underwater the visitor scientist or plain tourist is surrounded by an almost deserted landscape of black volcanic rocks where swim several species of fish from this Ocean common to all European and Mediterranean coastal zones.
