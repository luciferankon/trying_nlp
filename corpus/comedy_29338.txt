Geekin' is an original story about a group of friends united by their common passion: role-playing games. Week-in and week-out as often as they can these socially awkward misfits indulge their imaginations in the mythical land of Tir Sidaj where they claim persona's as warriors wizards healing witches and one ornery gnome. The strength of this Geek Utopia is tested however when the one force strong enough to rend it is introduced into the mix. Friendships will be broken and bonds will be shattered as the friends must deal with the ultimate Geek weakness: an attractive girl. "Geekin'" is a lighthearted comedy that begs the question of how far a geek will go for love. Enough to back-stab his friends? Destroy his fragile social circle? Or even... break up the adventuring party??
