A televised debate between 1960 presidential candidates John F. Kennedy (Democrat and Richard M. Nixon (Republican). Most political observers agree that Nixon came across poorly--unprepared nervous and sweating profusely--while Kennedy seemed calm collected confident and knowledgeable and the general consensus was that Kennedy handily won the debate and it was this performance that convinced much of the public that Kennedy would be a better president than Nixon.
