With Gutter Punks (Cinequest 1998) Sims took a gritty and intimate look at street kids. In Becoming Vex he again focuses his attention towards young people (this time twenty-somethings) and portrays perhaps a more misanthropic view of society and the effects of violence. Trust lives in the 'burbs. Back in the day Trust and his two friends Johnny One Eye and Lefty spent their free time (which there was a lot of) raising hell and kicking ass. Several years later Johnny's work for a local crime lord has landed him in jail and Trust has begun to question the semi-normal life he has taken. After Trust is fired a trigger fires in his head and a new war begins with Trust at the forefront. Together with Lefty and Johnny-recently paroled-Trust leads the fight against "The Signal" the source of ultimate evil. But is there a signal? Or is that just something in Trust's mind?
