Willy Richard and Lionel three blue-collar friends from Montreal East leave the city and travel to the countryside for a weekend of hunting. Richard's wife forces him to bring along his young son Michel. For these men hunting represents total freedom and a chance to rid themselves of the frustrations of domestic life by proving their manhood. The group spends their first night at a motel bar and Michel silently observes as the adults get drunk try to outdo each other with insults and sexually harass the waitresses at the bar. It becomes apparent to him that Willy is not up to trip; he is overweight and clings to his glory days of the past. Michel must also watch as his father conducts an affair with a waitress. When the hunt finally begins Michel contemplates the imposed belief that a man ought to be a womanizing drinker who's good with a gun. Eventually the irresponsibility of the three men results in tragedy.
