Commissioned to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Illinois Arts Council this poignant and inspiring film interweaves the stories of four Illinois artists as they meet self-imposed artistic challenges and struggle with life challenges. From leading a teen theater ensemble to writing and conducting a symphonic jazz score to finding the perfect studio space to writing a poem the artistic process is shown to be at one with the process of living in the larger community.
