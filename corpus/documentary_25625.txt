Summer 1991. The last days of the Soviet Empire. Dark clouds gathered over Moscow as the Soviet government prepared to turn back the clock of history. While the world focused on the crashing Soviet Empire this film focuses on the people who would've been among the first to suffer repression - the women and men who have broken sexual taboos in a consummate act of liberation against a rigid crippled world. This is a view from their vantage point unveiling the shadow-side of Soviet culture in the wake of the revolution where the real provocative nudity is the nakedness of the soul.
