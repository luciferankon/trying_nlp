BURNING GREEN is a portrait of the rebels who overthrew Muammar al-Gaddafi the dictator who had ruled Libya for over 40 years. It covers the Libyan Revolution from long before the outbreak of the war when the rebels were secretly organizing at the risk of their very lives. Through interviews and first-person on-scene footage of the war BURNING GREEN explores who the rebels are how they came to stand against tyranny and how they hope to establish and preserve their freedom. BURNING GREEN also explores how the Gaddafi loyalists to this day seek to establish a new dictatorship under yet another Gaddafi. Ultimately BURNING GREEN will cover the attack on the former U.S. Consulate in Benghazi during which Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others lost their lives. BURNING GREEN will explore who was behind the attack how it happened and why the U.S. response was ineffective leading to the loss of four Americans.
