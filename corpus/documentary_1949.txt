Under the shadow of Mount Kenya young Maasai Warriors have remarkably formed a cricket team. In a community deep with tradition where female genital mutilation (FGM) is still a rite of passage these young Maasai express their frustrations at inequality by smacking cricket balls on the plains of Kenya and dreaming of life beyond their own village. Thus begins a journey all the way to England; the home of cricket. It is a journey which gives the Warriors the courage to face their elders in the hope of ending FGM.
