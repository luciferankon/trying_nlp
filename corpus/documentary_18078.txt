Animare: Trails in the World's Chaparral is a story about creation and decay about movement and static about growth and decrease about the vast source of nature and change. It is a meditation of light and darkness and sound and silence. Objects come into being and vanish they move or stand still they grow or shrink. They are found in nature: whole plants stalks roots panicles bones stones which obtain our interest. Also shaped forms of paper cut or torn which communicate with nature. Each sound has also a sound shadow and each shadow contains a sound. In the performance tension is created through slow movement and the dialog with the sounds. In October 2010 "Animare" was performed during the culture days in Sophienkirche in MÃ¼nchen (Riem). An exhibition of Gisela Oberbeck was shown: a series of paper cuts which figured vanished or threatened plants and they were integrated into the performance. Filmmakers and archivists Dietmar Post and Lucia Palacios captured the performance for the Play Loud (Live) Music Series.
