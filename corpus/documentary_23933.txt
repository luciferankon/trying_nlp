For the past two hundred years Aboriginal Australians have struggled to preserve their culture and identity while adapting to the modern world. But increasingly Indigenous Australians have been engaging with that world taking on leading roles in the community and securing an important place in industry by taking up the challenge of establishing their own business enterprises. The mining boom in Western Australia has driven a period of tremendous growth for the state with virtually all sectors of commerce and industry benefiting as a result. It is an environment that has stimulated new business opportunities for those with ideas and initiative. Indigenous In Business introduces six Aboriginal Australians who have taken advantage of that situation and often with the support of the mining and government sectors made successful ventures into business for themselves. In describing how they started their businesses and revealing their aspirations for the future they demonstrate the fact that being indigenous need not be a barrier to those with the determination and energy to succeed.
