This series is a retelling of the myth of Persephone in 10 episodes as we follow her cycle of life and death. Along the way she meets Primavera across the river Styx is riddled by an Enchantress - as Oedipus was by the Sphynx. She confronts her greatest fears shedding her skin as the Deer Queen - the Queen of the shades in the forest - for that of daughter and goddess of Spring. And then must find the courage and strength to bring upon death and winter or refuse and change the course of humankind forever. Hades and Demeter vie for the one they love and fight to hold together the worlds they they have created and rule.
