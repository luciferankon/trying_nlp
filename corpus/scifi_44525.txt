The Chrysanthemum Palace is addictive event television. Beautiful; thrilling; erotic; unpredictable. It will draw you into a stunning world never before seen yet instantly recognizable. It is a world where life hinges on a tiny gesture; where a glance from above a silk fan can bring a man to his knees or an army to its destruction; where honor and ruthlessness are two sides of a spinning jade coin. Nothing is what it seems - and no one is safe.
