Collectors counters surveyors "self-optimisers" - they all believe in the explainability of the world. It always comes down to giving order to chaos - sometimes through something as simple as the recording of empty bottles that have been collected. Apparently normal citizens at home getting high on weird and self developed statistics or trying to get a handle on the orderly nature of their bodily functions by means of complicated auto-experiments; researchers using systems of the most varied kinds to vainly struggle against the boundless character of their specialist topic; dubious bureaucratic planning fantasies: is orderliness really only half of existence?
