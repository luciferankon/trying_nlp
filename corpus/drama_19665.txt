Frank has come back from Spain and is rebuilding his life in Somerset. He starts out by selling motors but branches out by buying a seedy club - Frank's Empire Club. When Reg Priest the local Mr Big sends him a car to valet his assistant finds a body in the boot. Frank and the staff at the club don't want to fall foul of Reg but then again they don't want the police asking questions either.
