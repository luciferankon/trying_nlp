This film is based on the true story of Jean Bella who served as an officer in the Belgian Marine while being convinced from an early age that he was in fact a woman. Director Jean-Pol Ferbus follows Jean Bella and makes him talk about his life psychological and spiritual experiences and reveals the true poet who remained undisclosed for most of this person's life. The film ultimately isn't about transexuality but about loneliness one can experience when he/she feels very deeply that she/he belongs to the two sexes and this in a deep almost religious fashion to such an extent that sexuality itself is being erased from one's life. Jean-Gina Bella is a woman in the body of a man who bravely lived a life on the sea eventually fighting the elements talking to God when lost on the immense solitary ocean. This testimony is a very touching and poetic one.
