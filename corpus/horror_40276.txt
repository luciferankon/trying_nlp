Sara is totally happy. The young actress gained her first little role in a play by the playhouse-baron Gota Nishikono. Sara admires the leading actresses Aoi and Kaori who are practicing hard every day. But then a staff member is found dead and while the police is investigating the situation Aoi falls from a balcony and is taken to hospital. Due to her injuries she won't be able to play the leading role. So in a hurry Gota gives the part to Sara who is almost overwhelmed. But Sara has got to learn very soon that having the leading role is not to her advantage. Because she is recognizing slowly that somebody or something is trying to end the production at all cost!
