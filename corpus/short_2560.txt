Tom wakes up and realises he's had a one-night-stand. As his drink-addled mind feeds him dangerous memories his increasing anxiety fuels a paranoid imagination until he learns a valuable lesson. This is a fast paced roller-coaster ride through the mind of a man increasingly aware of the possible implications of his infidelity as he makes his way home the morning after the night before. First he imagines admitting everything to his wife; it doesn't play out well. So he tries running through an excuse: fine. Then he discovers his wedding ring is missing and remembers why; it's been swallowed. And he's in big trouble.
