A collection of three comic-dramatic stories set in Mumbai. The first is about a diligent office worker who wins the office 'Fun Committee Award' which entitles him to a whole day full of fun. He is most reluctant to leave the safety of his cubicle but he has to. Prescribed fun modules have to be completed and non-compliance is not an option... The second story begins with a domineering head-of-the-family Anil who is on life support. Seeking some relief his family decides to buy a TV which Anil had banned. Now every night the family plugs into a popular soap whose hero Purshottam is a man ideal in every way and they are smitten. Then suddenly comes the news that Anil is better and may be home soon. Will they have to let Purshottam go?... The third one centers on Aarti whose repetitive existence is slowly making her more and more mechanical and numb. Deep inside ferments a disconnect and unease that she is unable to articulate to anyone. Then one day there arrives a most intimate letter and everything changes...
