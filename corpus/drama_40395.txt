The streetsweeper is a loner who finds poetry in the ordinary... The Streetsweeper is a languid off-beat 75 minute feature film. A portrait of an urban Australian landscape as seen through the keen eyes of an eccentric pedestrian: inspired by the great "street films" of Antonioni Godard Jarmusch Kiarostami Linklater Tati Vertov & Wenders.
