Archie is a sophomore at Granada High fairly well adjusted with only one problem: his dad was a star high-school athlete who married the homecoming queen and dad insists that his only son Archie be a jock. Trouble is Archie's short. Dad makes him a deal: make a team any team and Arch can have the Ford Focus. So Archie tries out for every sport dreaming of the car and of Brittany O'Malley the most popular girl in school. Brittany knows something that changes Archie's life.
