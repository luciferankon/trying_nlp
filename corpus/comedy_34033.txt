The cast of "Your Show Of Shows" is reunited in several skits that keep true to the style of the show's best material. First an encounter at a market that leaves Sid battered amid the debris then Sid and Imogene as tourists in Paris then Sid Carl and Howie as incompatible shipmates in a submarine experiment. Next an hilarious take-off on "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolf" then an updated visit from "The Haircuts" and lastly all engage in a classic Caesar version of an Italian opera.
