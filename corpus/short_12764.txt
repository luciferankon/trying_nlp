Easy Breathing is a tragicomic story about Seija in the form of a short film. The movie follows Seija trying to fulfill her dreams of singing in public. To reach her goal she takes part in a karaoke course. But things aren't that simple: the more she practices and prepares for her number the further from the goal she appears to be. Not even diaphragmatic breathing is proving to be helpful.
