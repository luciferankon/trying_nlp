In SWIPE we follow Mitch Higgins a recent college graduate who has yet to live up to his potential. Mitch is single works at PetSmart and lives in a rundown apartment with his dog Coolio and his best friend Duncan. Mitch and Duncan pinch pennies anyway they can even if it means some shoplifting here and there. Their talent of the five fingered discount is soon discovered by Larry a crooked loss prevention officer who introduces them to the high stakes world of professional shoplifting and leads them down a path that neither of them are ready for.
