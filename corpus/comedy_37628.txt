We all know the old saying; 'All that is required for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing' - but how many of us are brave enough to take that challenge? To stand up for what's right and be a good man who doesn't do nothing? The Penumbra. One man who stands for justice in an unjust world. One man who will put himself between the ordinary people and those who would do them harm. One lone crusader willing to use the darkness in his own soul to fight the shadows that haunt the night. And where shadows meet you will find - The Penumbra! Fighting crime isn't easy. And for the Penumbra even finding crime is proving to be hard. And that's a problem. He's kept one alleyway safe for several weeks but how will he become the one man the city turns to in time of need if he doesn't make a name for himself? And how will he make a name for himself if there's no crime to fight? But if the forces of darkness think total obscurity no resources whatsoever or a complete lack of any experience is going to keep this urban warrior from his goal then they don't know - The Penumbra.
