After her father's abduction at the hands of the Nazis Musia's mother plans a daring escape from the Polish ghetto for herself and her two daughters. Heartrendingly orphaned at just 11 years-old Musia flees the Nazis and spends three winters in hiding alone fighting for her life in the forests of eastern Poland only 50 miles from the Belzec death camp.
