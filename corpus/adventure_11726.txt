England Cricket hero Freddie Flintoff spends eight days completely alone in a remote corner of Botswana's Okavango Delta. Armed with a camera to film his adventure Freddie is constantly on guard against the dangerous wild animals that live in the African bush - out here he's on the menu. He has to hunt and gather to supplement the emergency survival rations he has with him or he will go hungry and he has to collect boil and filter every last drop of the drinking water he needs to survive. After trouble setting camp and getting a fire going he realises that he needs to be more focussed and begins to find his feet. Freddie is entranced by a spectacular and alarmingly close encounter with a herd of elephants and decides that he would rather go hungry than hunt for food. Nearing the end of his time in the bush lions make a terrifying night time visit to Freddie's camp. After 7 nights and 8 days in the Okavango Delta Freddie strikes camp and heads for a rendezvous with the support team. It's been an extraordinary experience and one that he hopes to have again - next time with company.
