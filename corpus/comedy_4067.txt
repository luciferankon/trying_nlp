Episode #1001 - Out da' Closet - MAY 9TH May 9th - Episode # 1 - "Out Da' Closet" Musical guests Toby Love and Jean join Pitbull at Fade Master's Barbershop to discuss the "realities" of coming out da' closet but it looks like one of them might be "coming out da' closet" about something else. Outside on "La Esquina" Fademaster takes on a bet hoping that Cooch a heavy-set straight guy can beat Esteban a smaller gay guy in a boxing match. As usual the loser must wash the feet of a local bum El Chino who's lived on La Esquina for 30 years.
