Unusual mythological. The love story from the 'Mahabharata' features Devika Rani as the heroine born through divine benediction to Ashwapati and Ashok Kumar as Satyavan son of an exiled and blinded hermit. Although Satyavan is scheduled to die soon Savitri marries him and eventually propitiates Yama the god of death to return Satyavan's life and to restore her father-in-law's sight.
