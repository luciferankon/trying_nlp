In early 1950s Athens Antonis an idealist and well-respected Master shadow player witnesses the end of an era and the gradual yet inevitable demise of his once popular art. Without a doubt all of his dedication and the forty long years of hard work animating the elaborately crafted leather figures are about to perish as the winds of change with the coming of the imported menace of the cinema signify that shadow theatre is becoming a dying art. As a result in his desperate attempt to freeze time his determination will inevitably lead to a conflict with his close environment his younger sister Angela and his two aspiring assistants during a fluid and transitional stage in his life. In the very end when Antonis' world crumbles like a pack of cards against all odds the unconventional Master will play fearlessly one last time with a steady hand and an even steadier voice in what would be the performance of a lifetime.
