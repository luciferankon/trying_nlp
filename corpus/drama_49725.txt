In the absence of the biological mother too busy pursuing her theatrical career we see the glorification of the maternal surrogate a woman who is a paragon of sacrifice and self-abnegation. La Fuggitiva is also a film in which a child actress takes a prominent role. In this sentimental drama the little girl suffers for and rebels against the loneliness and neglect stemming from the lack of a mother and a loving family setting.
