Dogmatic Theology explores themes central to our Christian faith. Full of humour insight and theological consideration this eight-part series is based upon Fr. James Mallon's many experiences with his often mischievous "Monsi" a nine-year-old shepherd mix. Each theme probes into a mystery of faith which is then illuminated with a documentary story as well as a teaching by Dogmatic Theologian Dr. David Deane.
