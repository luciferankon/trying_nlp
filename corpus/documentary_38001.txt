Young Mozambican musicians who play Jazz Funky and Hip Hop join a group of elders who play Marrabenta a musical style typical of Mozambique in the 1950's and 60's. This unexpected combination of different types of music works extraordinarily well as we will see during their South African tour. This trip evokes the origins of each of the musicians.
