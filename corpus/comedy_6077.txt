Overall the idea is to make ethnicities politics races nations - to make all of them turn into non-existent objects... ...akin to ovals boxes blobs wardrobes! You might think he's really "someone" really a "representative of the people" but really just a representative of skirting boards of coffee rings nothing more. Overall political invective's that should be perceived solely as poetic invective's. Overall spreading geopolitics across geology and poetics. Like a question-Eskimo dancing and waving his ribbons in the air turns and changes on a pillar becomes a question-Holocaust. In fact "geopoetics" is a kind of a Holocaust seen as a choir as an ensemblement as an Eskimo.
