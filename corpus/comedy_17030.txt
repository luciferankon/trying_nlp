In "Parlamentet" we see the best Swedish comedians in disguise try dirty tricks on politicians and give their own obstinate solutions to Sweden's problems. After several seasons with Hans Rosenfeld as host this spring Henrik Schyffert took over. In the blue team we meet Sissela Kyle Helge Skoog Johan Wahlstr√∂m and Mikael Tornving. In the red team we meet Johan Ulveson Henrik Hjelt Annika Lantz and Babben Larsson. "Parlamentet" is based on the original idea "If I ruled the world" from Hat Trick.
