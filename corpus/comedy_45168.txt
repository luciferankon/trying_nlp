1980 West Germany. Frank Lehmann is drafted into the Bundeswehr because he neglected to object. As his petty-bourgeois pa claims his room for TV repairs Frank moves in with hippie squatters in his natal Bremen. Just as in the army his big mouth and naive honesty keep causing trouble. He's appointed unit spokesman and shows courage standing up for a virtual deserter. Back home pacifists keep blaming him as if he volunteered. Trouble at the Berlin Wall changes a lot.
