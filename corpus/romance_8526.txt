YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE is a heartfelt screenplay about finding the courage to change and fall in love again after life (and others) had let you down... Through the four female characters of the film (Emily an 18 year-old aspiring model Ellen a not-so-typical American-Greek housewife from Astoria Rebecca a NY socialite Betty a down-an-out on her luck TV presenter) we begin to understand the complexity of the everyday challenges and the relationship issues they are facing (one out of eight women is going to face the challenge of breast cancer). And hopefully we can transform ourselves alter our perspective and ultimately change our own complicated and distorted relationship and attitude towards breast-cancer patients. The mood pace and overall tone of the film is unique since it is elevated far above the drama of the four leading female characters. They are searching for the light in the end of the tunnel. They remain optimistic and humorous even in the worst of circumstances and challenges they are facing.
