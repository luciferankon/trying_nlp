Pregnancy is the center of middle-eastern Muslim woman's life. Marrying getting pregnant & raising kids are her reason for being; what would a dream be then? The film is an exploration of 4 ambitious women choices of work and\or family. It is a search of their hidden faces & of the factors effecting their choices & drives. It is a brief approach to the life and choices of four middle-eastern young women trying to find their individuality within their social religious & political surroundings. A view of their discourses whether they were trying to justify their compromises & surrender or trying to break-out in what seems to be an absurd quest.
