Approximately 155 million viewers see one or more of the CBS Cares campaigns each year on the CBS Television Network. (Source: NTI). These campaigns -- scripted and produced by CBS - usually consist of PSAs featuring Talent from a wide array of Primetime series on the CBS Television Network. The PSAs may be free standing or tied to storylines of shows. There have been rare instances where non CBS Stars have appeared in CBS Cares PSAs -- for example Nelson Mandela's historic 2006 Tolerance messages developed by CBS in partnership with the Nelson Mandela Foundation. These PSAs were seen by more than 200 million viewers on the CBS Television Network and aired in 82 other countries. Another exception was a PSA for Big Brothers Big Sisters -- developed in partnership with CBS Sports and the NFL -- that was seen by over 90 million viewers during Super Bowl XLI. It featured Super Bowl coaches Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith. CBS Cares has also been a pioneer in the use of humor in PSAs to connect with viewers on serious issues.
