ROUND is a research project on analogue and digital myths of creation. In consultation with scientists folklorists and theologians we study the sterile white digital world of replication; a virtual breeding farm. Turbulent floods and disembodied hands sculpt figures with uncertain identities. Bodies roll chasing their own shadows in an infinite stream. A human race - questioning the danger or benefit of becoming a thing amongst the things we produce.
