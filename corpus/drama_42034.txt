Johnnie Byrne is a member of the British Parliament. In his 40s he's feeling frustrated with his life and his personal as well as professional problems tower up over him. His desires to win the next election are endangered by his constant looking for love and he is faced with the choice of giving up a career in politics or giving up the woman he loves. Representing the Labour Party popular forty-two year old politician Johnnie Burke has been reelected with a larger majority as a Member of the British Parliament this time on the governing side. Many speculate that Prime Minister Stephens will offer him a high ranking position in government but that is not the case. As an ambitious politician he is privately disappointed but initially shows public support for his leader's decisions. At home he is in a long time loveless marriage to Alice who leaves him he thinks because he didn't get a post within government. Her departure highlights how much he really craves female companionship both physically and emotionally. The first woman available to him in both capacities is his lonely but willing neighbor Mary. But Johnnie eventually meets twenty year old model Pauline West to who he is immediately attracted. But a married man carrying on with a woman young enough to be his daughter is not compatible with the life of a politician especially one who is contemplating making an opportunistic move in government. Johnnie has to decide if his personal or political life is more important especially as women enter and exit his life.
