This is a film about a man in Miskolc. For some he is an artist for others the saviour of poor Gipsy children while some people know him simply as a plumber. The course of his life has taken some strange turns but it is always about doing something about endurance and the basic philosophy of "being a good man". This is a person who puts all his time and energy into making the world a better place.
