Linear Tales is a web series of stand-alone episodes taking place in a "squared" world which is though so real as our own. One of the main characters is Natalie a young painter who is full of dreams and ambitions and tries to make them come true. On the way to fulfill her goals she randomly bumps into Thomas a restless-minded engineer who builds unique machines. During each episode we will witness moments of our characters' lives which may intersect or evolve in parallel in a linear world much alike to our own.
