The year is 1899 Wealthy industrialist Oswald Mandus awakes in his bed wracked with fever and haunted by dreams of a dark and hellish engine. Tortured by visions of a disastrous expedition to Mexico broken on the failing dreams of an industrial utopia wracked with guilt and tropical disease he wakes into a nightmare. The house is silent the ground beneath him shaking at the will of some infernal machine: all he knows is that his children are in grave peril and it is up to him to save them.
