One tango orchestra "t√≠pica" twelve singers and twelve new songs recorded all together in a single 5-hours-and-a-half recording session day. "Un disparo en la noche" brings together the most important exponents of contemporary tango and strikes a turning point in the discography of this Argentinian iconic patrimony. The documentary filmed completely in Buenos Aires by director Alejandro Diez shows the behind the scenes of this album production describing the philosophy that precedes the studio work without hiding at the same time a fresh look at current tango. A new golden age of Tango claimed not only music but also the value of the song for the development of our popular genre.
