A vast salvage yard lies nestled in the woods on the edge of a Mid-Western town. Owned and operated by a pair of sadistic murderous brothers the yard is a place of death and unimaginable horror. At night the salvage yard is watched over not by canines of the four-legged breed but by Dog" the owners' tormented younger brother. Warped by years of abuse at the hands of his brothers horribly deformed by generations of in-breeding the feral boy (more beast than man) prowls the shadowy confines of the junk yard slaughtering anyone foolish enough to enter after night falls." There's more of course...much more!
