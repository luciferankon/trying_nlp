Edda Ciano the daughter of the fascist dictator Benito Mussoliniwas held in detention on the island of Lipari (20 December 1945). Upon her exile Edda felt sick and alone with the pressure imposed by the authorities. The sole sympathy that came to her hard feelings was from the head of communist party Leonida Borgiorno who belonged to an anti-fascist family. At the end of her detention period their strong bonds did not cease despite all circumstances.
