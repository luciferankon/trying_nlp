Twinsen lives with his wife Zoe on the Citadel Island. They belong to the species Quetch which looks like humans with ponytails. The planet Twinsun is inhabited by three other species; Grobos (elephants) Rabbitunnies (rabbits) and Spheros (short spherical creatures). They all lived in harmony til evil Dr FunFrock did his coup d'Ã©tat and changed planet Twinsun to a police state where suspicion is omnipresent. He has at his disposal two high tech weapons that insure his power: cloning and teleportation. Twinsen wakes up imprisoned in a asylum cause of his prophecy dreams he'd been received from the elemental force goddess Sendell. Accompanied by a lonely flute and reverse crash cymbal he tries to make is way out of the prison.
