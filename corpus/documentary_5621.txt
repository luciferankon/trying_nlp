By the mid 1970s the Dorset Theatre Festival under the leadership of Jill Charles and John Nassivera evolved into one of the most respected professional theatre companies in New England supported by a company of actors directors technicians interns and apprentices who returned year after year as if returning to a loving family reunion. However the 100 year-old Playhouse had fallen into disrepair as age and harsh weather elements took its toll. During the brutal winter of 2000/2001 DTF began an ambitious and sometimes controversial major renovation of the historic playhouse. In the midst of this triumph the documentary "Setting the Stage for a New Century" also chronicles Jill Charles final days battling breast cancer and the courage it took for her to see the project to its completion.
