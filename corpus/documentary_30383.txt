Tempo Fuori Luogo is a point of view on the world of psychical and psychological disability. It's a reflection on the temporal dimension perceived by the guests of a nursing home in the Marche a region of Italy. Dilated time is the true main character of this survey. The documentary was born from the will to get close to a liminar reality and to take a look at it trying to avoid pietism filled with prejudice that normally pollutes the idea of a society in which diversities don't represent a limit in comparison to the false shared norm but different and new chances to live everyday life.
