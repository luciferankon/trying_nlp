A popular Chinese folklore tells of how the Jade Emperor the king of gods expelled the angels Golden Boy and Jade Girl from heaven to the human world. There they are cursed to a romance that spans seven lives during which they could never be together. Kao Bing-Bing ('Cindy Yu-Han Lien' (qv)) is a modern-day woman who believes she is the reincarnated Jade Girl.
