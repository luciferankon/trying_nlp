The story of an Iraq Vet interviewed in prison by a Vietnam Vet doing a documentary for a major network on vets in prison. During the interview Sonny confesses to killing a group of civilians in combat. It was this incident that landed him in prison. It weighed so heavily on his soul that he had he tried to commit suicide by holding up a bar with an unloaded weapon and is sentenced to eight years for attempted robbery. The tortured Iraq vet is the principal focus of the film. After the documentary airs a group of outraged viewers petition for the vet's release and win him parole. When he gets out he finds there's nowhere he can go where people don't know him and know what he did including his son from a broken marriage who won't speak to him. The Iraq Vet character then goes after the documentary to kill him but what Ben really wants is to be killed. And what the documentary really wants is to be killed for his sins in Vietnam. Both men take the journey together.
