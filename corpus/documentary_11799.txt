Hear the stories behind some of the hardest slams. Surfing pipeline with a giant wave behind and less then 2 feet of water between you and razor sharp coral reef can only be attempted by few people in the world. One missed landing backfliping a motorcycle over a gap means broken bones for sure. Broken bones busted teeth fractured ribs bruised hips bleeding elbows and cracked sculls these guys risk life and limb every day to do what they love. Pain is universal.
