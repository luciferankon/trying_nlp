Everything around us has a story to tell. Shoes cans string mirrors; everything we see and touch has an epic tale of how it came to be invented or discovered and the dramatic moments throughout history at which it played an important role. But few of us know these stories. We go through our days blissfully ignorant of the deadly and dangerous road brave men traveled in order to bring coffee to the world or the pivotal part beer played in the civilizing of mankind. These stories and many more are brought vividly to life in this two-hour special which follows one man on a journey through the last day of his life examining and recounting the epic tales of the everyday items he encounters before his ignorance of their stories leads him to his ultimate doom.
