After having lived and worked in New York Berlin and Brussels the Belgian artist Gert Robijns returned to his native village a small hamlet with fewer than 200 inhabitants. When his grandmother moved into an old people's home he bought her house and created his masterpiece Reset Home a sculpture that combines an artist's residence-cum-exhibition space. The documentary 'Reset' follows the artist during the construction of his work a struggle that takes two years to complete. We see the changes that this project sets in motion on many levels. In the first instance in the house itself but as time goes by the village as a whole is affected by the arrival of the artist and his controversial project. For Robijns himself the ups and downs of the building process become an intense inner journey. We also see the slow decline of his grandmother and the complex nature of his love-hate relationship with the village. What's more the closer we get to Robijns the more we recognize how lonely and heavy life can be as an artist. But at the same time we witness the creation of an outstanding work of art and are party to this unique man's worldview and his intriguing way of thinking.
