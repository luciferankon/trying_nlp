Childhood battles on a secluded island offshore the small New England town of Unity have plagued 11-year-old Randy Scott ever since he became the target of local bullies the Coltrains Jimmy Mike and Simon. The Coltrain brothers don warpaint and terrorize the other kids. Simon especially is merciless bragging that fists bounce off him earning him the nickname "Ironsides." At home Randy's father a low-level boxer not proud of how he earns a living begs his bruise-covered son to make peace. Conversely at the Coltrain's home the bullies are taught to fight by Frank their alcoholic abusive father who enforces sadistic training and beats both the brothers and their mother Alice. When Randy's father leaves town to fight his final match before retiring Randy remains in the care of his disabled Aunt Mildred. Suffering at the hands of Simon and his brothers for control of the island Randy struggles to find a way toward peace to make his father proud. But when Mr. Coltrain's "training" goes too far Randy intervenes and saves a life. The physical abuse Simon is forced to endure and Randy's desire for resolution soon make them both realize that perhaps their best hope is each other.
