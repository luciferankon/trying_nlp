After a half century of wars and conflicts the Porfiriato or Porfirio DÃ­az regime was seen as an era of economic progress and political tranquility. The expansion of railroads the growth of mining and agricultural production and capable stable governance brought prosperity to many corners of the State of Mexico although the masses remained immersed in poverty and political rights were infringed.

The railroad communicated it both internally and with neighboring states mining and agricultural production grew and commerce banking and industry expanded. However old grievances would soon lead to popular rebellion.
