Single mothers Faye and Ashley set up a dog-walking business in their native Bristol. The posh neighbours on one side are unhappy because the dogs poo on their lawnthe elderly couple on the other side claim the dogs try to ravish them. One day a pug in the girls' care goes missing. They think they've found it but it's an identical one belonging to the Big Issue seller and neither he nor the pug's owner are happy when both dogs turn up. The posh neighbours report them for running a business in a Housing Association property whilst both women agree to see their ex-boyfriends without the other one knowing.
