Flicker + Pulse is a striking and poignant portrayal of time passing in a beautiful English walled garden. Using real-time and time-lapse footage the film explores the relationship between the seasons and the plants and people who work within the walls of the garden. Locked into the clock of the solar system the garden performs its annual display guided by the ritualistic human intervention of those passionately engaged with its soil.
