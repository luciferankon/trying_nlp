Set over Easter weekend Evelyn and Jonathan - both widowed and in their fifties - meet again when their children fall in love with each other. They almost married each other in their twenties but Evelyn got cold feet. Later Evelyn married one of Jonathan's divorced friends Thomas and left her Catholic faith rather than wait for him to obtain an annulment. Jonathan had encouraged her many times to return to the faith during her marriage but she resisted. When Evelyn approaches Jonathan insisting they try to stop their children's marriage both Evelyn and Jonathan's true feelings for each other emerge. Will Evelyn return to the faith and marry Jonathan or remain estranged?
