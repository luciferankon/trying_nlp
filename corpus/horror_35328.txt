K.C. and Jo are two hardened female ex-cons who decide to build a marina on a lake in backwoods Texas to start a life for themselves only to be hassled by the redneck locals who do not like outsiders and that the lakeshore is their own regular hangout. But K.C. and Jo's worst troubles come from Junior a slow-witted psycho redneck who gets the O.K. from his equally demented mother to kill the two.
