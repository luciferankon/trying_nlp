For the first time in the history of one of the largest psychiatric institutions the film crew was allowed to see the everyday life of patients cut off from the outside world. 'Where is the human soul? Is it in the heart? In the brain? Or maybe elsewhere?' wonders an old doctor who has spent his life working at a psychiatric hospital in the Siberian countryside. This is one of the places that one does never leave. Behind the wall isolating the patients from the world we meet people affected by serious mental disorders schizophrenics bipolar patients a serial murderer and many others who ended there because they were not needed any more. For decades they are waiting for someone to take them back to the normal world. Some should not even be hospitalised at all. The patients are taken care of by only five doctors and a couple of nurses who devoted the best years of their lives to serving subsequent generations in the hospital. The institution shows life in a lens the world convex in one place in all of its dimensions. Discreet thoughtful observations of the patients' everyday life turn into a meditation about the impenetrable human nature. The film is searching for humanity where there is no more hope.
