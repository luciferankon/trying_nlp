The Duck Commander Phil Robertson makes a compelling argument on the absurdity of life without God. Featuring real-life footage from events throughout history and leading up to the modern day crisis of radical Islamic terrorism Phil personally guides us through a journey that includes Athens Greece; Rome Italy; Paris France; and even the notorious Nazi death camp of World War II Auschwitz. With a biblical perspective Phil covers events ranging from the creation of the atomic bomb the impact of the Holocaust and the Civil Rights Movement. He uses these events to illustrate that God is the only meaningful anchor to a civilized society and calls on all of us to consider our faith.
