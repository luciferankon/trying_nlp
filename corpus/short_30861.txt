This is a story of a master and his 2 pupils where one of the students named Sameer murders his master caused by jealousy. Sameer later tries to kill his friend but ghost of his master restricts him and on the contrary kills Sameer to pursue vengeance of his death. Now Sameer takes a form of ghost and heads toward fulfilling his wish of killing his friend. Here we show the difference between VENGEANCE and REVENGE where the ghost of teacher who was killed by this own pupil wants justice of his death i.e. the VENGEANCE whereas the killed pupil who had an incomplete wish becomes a ghost to execute his friend i.e. the REVENGE.
