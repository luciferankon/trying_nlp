Olaf is to take care of the family's cleaner's store while his dad is away on a fair. In the evening he runs into three Brazilian ladies thrown out of a limousine not knowing where to go. Olaf invites them to stay with him and his deaf pot-smoking grandfather which at first just causes some confusion as he soon is to marry his girlfriend Vera. The next day it's topsy-turvy all over.
