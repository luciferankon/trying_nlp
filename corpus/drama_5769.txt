As independent as film gets God's Baboons is a testament to the possibilities of self expression in film. Written produced directed scored and performed in by Jonathan Sutton this film has a unity and originality that strongly realize its personal subject matter. Deeply felt performances by a superb ensemble cast enhance an already suspenseful unpredictable and provocative drama. This film has a voice and it creeps up on you.
