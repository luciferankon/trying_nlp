In the beginning of this film we see an elderly man cycling to his workplace a factory in a small town but not for work. Instead he walks determinedly to the manager's room takes a sawn-off shotgun from under his coat and kills his boss. The events that led to this desperate action are then gone through in documentary style: the company's decision to close down an entire department of the factory the unsuccessful negotiations between the staff and the management and the final denouncement of over 30 workers most of whom find themselves unable to find new work anywhere else.
