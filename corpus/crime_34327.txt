Retiro Station Buenos Aires. In the middle of a drizzle 3 boys try to watch the opening of the World Cup in Korea and Japan through the window of a pizzeria but they are thrown out. The Argentina-Nigeria match is in a couple of days. Arriving at the villa the young people make a strange pact which when the time comes they will see the game in colors and they will do it together or separately at all costs. From that moment on each of the 3 will do this pact with different consequences.
