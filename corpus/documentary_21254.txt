Caf√© Waldluft is not what it used to be. Once a tourist hot spot nestling in the picturesque mountains of Bavaria it turned out to be a run-down hotel with a few remaining guests in their late sixties. But there is something very unique about the place: it offers shelter to refugees from all across the globe. For each one of them it bares the hope of a new beginning the aspiration of a new home - waiting somewhere behind a multitude of obstacles. So what does it take for them to arrive for good? What does it really take for a place to become home?
