Los Wildcats Del Norte is the story of a group of young musicians rich in family tradition who set out hoping for nothing more than to play the bars of northern New Mexico. The simple Norteno music grows in depth and complexity as the group matures. Through a series of shared events sometimes comic sometimes tragic they come to expect more from the music more from life and more from each other.
