Santa has neighbors at the North Pole - two feuding polar bears named Iggy Lou Bear and Edgar Allan Snow. Both want to recapture the warm feelings of Christmas from childhood so each intends to get a Christmas Tree of his own. The only trouble is there's only one tree in the whole frozen north! A hilarious battle of will and wit ensues as the two bears feud to "win" the only tree in the land.
