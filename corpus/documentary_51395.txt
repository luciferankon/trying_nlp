Jennifer Palmer a corporate IT specialist-turned-writer is compelled to make sense of the mysterious and powerful energy she felt at her aunt's deathbed. A series of strange coincidences leads her on an exploration of synchronicity - the concept that all beings are interconnected and that time is not so much a chronology as it is an infinite cycle. Considering herself something of a skeptic Jennifer treads the fine line between nervous breakdown and ecstatic revelation as she seeks out scholars shamans artists and community activists in her search for answers. Together they explore a reality where time is transformed from a unit that can be measured and commodified -"Time is money"- to an experience of oneness with the natural rhythms of nature and the universe. It is here that the writer discovers that time is in fact art.
