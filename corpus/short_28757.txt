Adam is a charming casual nonchalant and still clumsy young guy. He is gorgeous and late for class this morning. But he has a good reason : last night was full of alcohol strangers and music the kind of night that would drive you into doing anything. Adam likes that girls like him. 'Folles d'Adam' is the story of Adam and girls who are crazy about him.
