There are questions that have gone unanswered for nearly a century regarding the sinking of the Lusitania. Some of those questions are: . After the torpedo hit the Lusitania there was a second devastating explosion. What was the source of this second unexplained explosion? . What was the mission for the three German spies that were caught on the Lusitania just after the ship left port in New York? . Why did the British Admiralty give the Lusitania orders that are still restricted as top secret just prior to the sinking and why did they tell the Lusitania to ignore the standing orders to travel through certain high risk areas at top speed and not to zigzag as was customary? . Why did the British Navy drop a plethora of mines on the Lusitania remains in an attempt to destroy all evidence of its existence over 30 years after it sank? For decades conspiracy theorists have postulated that the British Government had a secret weapon that was being transported in the Lusitania's cargo hold. Our story answers these questions in an entertaining and plausible fashion. In short our script is based on historical facts while using literary license to add to the already intriguing story.
