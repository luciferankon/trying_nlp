Tim is going through the worst day in his adult life leading up to an ultimatum from his inconsiderate roommate to either find a new job by the end of the month or find a new place to stay. After several unsuccessful interviews lady luck landed him the job he never knew existed. Ralphy (Edward Barbanell) has had some bad luck with a string of selfish companions. They all seem to take advantage of him in one way or another because of his disability never even asking Ralphy where he wants to go. This has left Ralphy with a bad taste in his mouth when it comes to trusting companions and especially skeptical of his new inexperienced companion Tim.
