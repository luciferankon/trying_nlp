Idealistic GP Dr. Peter Sommerfeld keeps annoying medical conference speakers with awkward questions about relevant innovations in patients' interest. Initially skeptic when invited by medical equipment firm "Kerner-Medi-Tech" as well-paid consultant he accepts to inspire its R&D but finds the head grimly uncooperative yet comes up with an idea to combine existing electric stimulants to a device for less local application. he hires unconventional interim Irene KÃ¼rschner when the firm requires more of his time also attending conferences and tricking him into speaking there while coaxed with perks and seductive PR executive Nora Hansen. Missing his own birthday party at buddy Luca Perugini's Italian restaurant Peter's truth time approaches.
