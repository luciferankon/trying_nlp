After the huge financial and cultural success of filming 1969's Woodstock music festival in the Oscar-winning documentary Woodstock (1970); filmmaker and political activist Michael Wadleigh spent many years in Hollywood writing scripts that were never produced. However Wolfen (1981) loosely based on Whitley Strieber's bestselling book of the same name was green-lit by Orion Pictures in 1979. After that Wadleigh would never complete another major motion picture again. This is the story of that film but it is also a very real story about Man Nature Terrorism in New York and the relationship between Native American Indians and Wolves. Thoughtful tragic lyrical and eerily prophetic Wolfen is a film awaiting rediscovery.
