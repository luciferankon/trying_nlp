Sitting in a mysterious theatre in the city a young man dreams to climb the Matterhorn along the classic Italian way opened by J.A. Carrel in 1865. A marvelous journey through the folds of time and space in direct contact with the wisdom of the wilderness in search of a new "way" towards the within.
