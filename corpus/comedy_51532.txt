Mark (Mark Cosentino) and Logan (Barry Richey) are best of friends and have dealt with different relationships in their lives. Mark seems to always find love in the right places but Logan doesn't. When Logan finds out that his girl friend Kelly (Christina Lyons) has been cheating on him he must try and figure out where his life is headed and leans on his friends and God for help. Perhaps his close friend Summer (Chrysanthe Pappas) has an answer he didn't expect.
