Sydney based filmmaker Craig Boreham made a short film called Ostia - La Notte Finale about the murder of Italian filmmaker Pasolini and put a trailer of the film on YouTube for the world to see. One of the film's lead actors Miles Szanto who played a young gay rent-boy in the film was suddenly faced with a barrage of hate mail from young fans of his other work on television. Craig decided to speak to other actors who have played gay on screen and discover their experiences.
