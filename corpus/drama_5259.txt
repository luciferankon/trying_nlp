Johanka ('Tereza Voriskova' (qv)) spends all of her time in her café Laputa. Men come here leave again. Miki a poet leaves for Turkey with Johanka's sister; Johanka's old flame Felix returns from distant travels forms a band and then flies off again to Puerto Rico where he gets married. Futility stares out at Johanka from every beer mug and so she turns the café into a massage parlor. Apparently nothing has changed but the cards say it clearly: she should take a look at her life from a distance and realize that this is me this is my home and this is my family.
