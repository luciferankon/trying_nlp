Lentil Soup is a faith-based Christian film about two brothers on opposite sides of the law who unfortunately become bitter enemies. Thomas a successful yet self-centered young police chief is fueled by an unquenchable quest for vengeance whereas his older brother Paul a born again believer serving a life sentence in prison is forced to confront the tyranny of his manipulative brother after being coaxed into foolishly escaping from custody. Both men are compelled to face their past as well as their inevitable future in this very powerful story about the genuine power of forgiveness and redemption. During the wake of their mother's death two brothers one a born-again Christian who is serving a life sentence in prison and the other a newly appointed police chief of their small hometown and someone who struggles with his faith uncover a profound family secret after the eldest brother is lured by temptation and coincidentally escapes from custody that could sever what remains of their broken relationship or could very well be the catalyst that restores it. This is a very powerful story of redemption and forgiveness.
