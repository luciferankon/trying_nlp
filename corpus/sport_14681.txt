The 1975 World Series between the Boston Red Sox of the American League and the Big Red Machine (Cincinnatti Reds) of the National League generally is considered the greatest world's championship match-up in baseball history. The Reds prevailed against the BoSox in seven games and 'Pete Rose' (qv) was named Most Valuable Player.
