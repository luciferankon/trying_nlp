THE BOTTOM LINE is a comedy-drama-romance about two business execs and a consultant that meet at a trade show and end up in a bar. Through the use of pithy dialog irreverent documentary-style interviews and bluntly honest narrative the loneliness isolation and self-discovery of the characters becomes apparent. Baby-boomers who have "been there done that" will particularly appreciate this slice-of-life feature.
