We aren't dying the way we used to. We have ventilators dialysis machines ICUs-technologies that can "fix" us and keep our bodies alive-which have radically changed how we make medical decisions. In our death-denying culture no matter how sick we get there is always "hope." Defining Hope tells the story of patients dealing with life-threatening illness as they move between ICUs operating rooms hospice care and home. Diane is a nurse caring for end-stage cancer patients when she is diagnosed with ovarian cancer herself. 23-year-old Alena undergoes a risky brain surgery that destroys her short-term memory. 95-year-old Berthold lives with his elderly wife who struggles to honor his wish of dying peacefully at home. Defining Hope follows these patients and others- and the nurses that guide them along the way- as they face death embrace hope and ultimately redefine what makes life worth living.
