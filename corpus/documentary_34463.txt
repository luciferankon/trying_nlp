Panair do Brasil revives the story of the most important commercial aviation company in Brazil between 1930 and 1965 with its commercial daring in establishing routes to the four corners of a continental country taking the adventure of air transport to never-before imagined places as well as the first international routes. Four decades after it closed its doors it still retains a marked presence in the country's collective imagination for its pioneering spirit and stories of heroic deeds and for the bewilderment which was aroused by the facts surrounding its closure during the military regime.
