Thomas Wallner is surprised to be suddenly handed management of the family boutique while his daughter Elke (mother of twins) gets the house of his parents Werner and Henriette who celebrate their 25th anniversary by moving into a Málaga villa. However the pitiful state of the house delayed properties shipping the Spanish 'mańana ethics' and utter lack of a plan how to spend their limitless free time soon triggers mounting tension among the solid couple which now lacks a common (business) purpose and day structure. While Werner enjoys flirtatious attention from real estate agent neighbor Achim Höppner's foxy wife Doris Henriette gets viciously jealous. Visiting friends Vera and Erich force them to pull together for an anniversary party but it turns out so badly that she returns alone to Germany to help Elke pursue her authentic bakery dream leaving Werner alone and desperate enough for an equally bold fault.
