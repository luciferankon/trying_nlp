A rare film combining art and science Moonwalk is a large-scale immersive experience in hemispherical fulldome format. It is an experimental film about humanity's relationship with the Moon. Beautiful Moonwalk weaves together literature and science with iconic songs and imagery into a grand audiovisual hyperlink. The film characterizes our placid heavenly neighbor as a living scintillating force. Stemming from the countless photos which comprise lunar atlases the Moon shatters into pieces and then rebuilds itself. It evolves from its familiar pregnant blackness into a lambent jittering hive of voices and sounds. Moonwalk reminds us of the Moon's ubiquity compelling us to reconstruct our own personal history of the Moon. This accomplished work reaches beyond the idealized childhood daydreams of the heavens past the familiar Apollo footage and into the tender roots of culture which weave throughout our daily personal lives.
