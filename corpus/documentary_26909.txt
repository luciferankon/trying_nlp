Life in Feathers is the name given to a choreographic production by Continuo Theatre (which was a story about the search for lost wings); it is also an ironic label for the kind of life lived by those who serve the theatre industry. Continuo means to continue or to link and the documentary is indeed about building links with the life of a community about losing freedom when trying to gain it says the film-maker who collected the material for the film for four years.
