Promises Written in Water is an extremely stripped down abstract romantic story of a man and a woman both in crisis. Kevin (Vincent Gallo) is a long-time professional assassin specializing in the termination of life. Mallory (Delfine Bafort) is a wild poetic beautiful young woman confronting her terminal illness and eventual suicide. She reaches out to Kevin to take responsibility for her corpse once she passes requesting his protection of her dead body's dignity until her cremation. Kevin's acceptance of this request causes uncomfortable self-reflection and changes the lens through which he views death.
