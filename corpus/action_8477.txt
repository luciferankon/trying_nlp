They give Leonard that file give him seventy-two hours and he gets them results. That's the difference he's the real deal. But when the piles of fugitive files start stacking up on Leonard's desk he knows it is time to call Rob Dick. This team will work on the cases as they come down the line if Leonard and Rob can't find and arrest these fugitives no one can. Follow along as the team locates and arrests three wanted individuals; chasing them down side streets tricking them over the phone and following one trail from California all the way to Oklahoma.
