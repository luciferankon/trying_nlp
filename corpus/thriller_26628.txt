GOLDEN is a psychological morality tale about a group of hikers who discover an abandoned 19th century goldmine in Yosemite. An earthquake plummets one of the group members down the mine shaft where she is pinned under a rock. The group has to choose between saving their friend by calling the park rangers for assistance or taking the time to unlawfully mine the discovered gold for themselves. GOLDEN is based on true events and inspired by both the Gold Rush-era Mariposa Indian War and the curse of Chief Tenaya issued as a result of that conflict between gold miners and Native Americans as well as the current phenomenon of people exploring the 500000 abandoned mines across the U.S. and falling afoul of the hazards these mines pose.
