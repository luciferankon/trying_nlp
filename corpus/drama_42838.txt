Could one become a refugee within his own country or city? A college student is down-and-out when he loses contact with his father is unable to pay for his studies or living and is soon within the grip of a string of bad luck bad people and bad decisions. The yakuza thugs and the police thugs and the homeless thugs are not helping the matter either.
