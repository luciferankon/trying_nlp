In July artist Megumi Igarashi a.k.a. Rokudenashiko was arrested on obscenity charges after building a vagina-shaped kayak and distributing data that would allow people to 3D print a model of her genitals. She was released shortly thereafter but re-arrested again in early December; the day before Christmas she was released on bail. She is currently undergoing a lengthly trial. If she's found guilty she faces up to two years in prison and a $20000 fine. There's not much nuanced coverage of her case in Western media but some experts say that it could be a landmark case for Japan where strict obscenity laws forbid the depiction of genitals in all mediums including art and pornography. However despite these laws traditional Japanese festivals persist-many of which openly celebrate sex organs. We went to the annual Festival of the Steel Phallus at which revelers gather in the streets to watch a procession of massive penis statues to try to make sense of this contradiction: Why is a 3D-printed vagina classified as obscene while a penis parade is seen as family friendly?
