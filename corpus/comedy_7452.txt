Jockey Willie "Wonderboy" Trotter was convicted of animal brutality and arson and spent three years in an Arizona correctional facility operated by legendary Warden Sherriff Joe. Upon release from prison Willie's jockey license is suspended indefinitely. He decides to take a loan out against his desert property to purchase his own "Sure Bet." However since his name is mud in the racing industry and given that he is on house arrest Willie sends his bloodstock agent to Keeneland Auction with a hundred thousand dollars in cash to purchase "Valid Expectation" a yearling champion; unfortunately the bloodstock agent disappears with Willie's money. Utterly despondent Willie places a new bet and loses his last three grand on a Triple Crown hopeful. Willie discovers that the loan shark he owes money to happens to be the former owner of the famed horse with whom Willie rode as well as the subject of the crime in which he was framed. With a chance meeting with a disgruntled mortician Willie decides the way out of his debt with a mobster is to turn to semi-honest work and open up a mortuary on his desert property. Willie recruits the most unfortunate bunch of losers and two former hit men who are now in the witness protection program to sell funeral plans. This mortuary is a cut-price sorry establishment and their efforts to remain legitimate prove next to impossible when the mobsters insist on dropping off bodies from their executions. A zany plan is put into action to keep the mortuary open for business as well as getting the mobsters off their backs for good and ridding themselves of the extra remains before the local police chief catches on.
