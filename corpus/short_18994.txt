In 1973 Caroline Kennedy spent an evening in London dancing at a gala ball with brewery heir Erskine Guinness. The film centers around the next morning as Caroline attempts to make some frozen orange juice in the kitchen blender with mixed results. Intercut with this is footage of the migratorial aspects of an unspecified African tribe who advise the viewer to 'dance now for tomorrow we go.'
