Emmy: The Story of an Orphan highlights the story of 14-year-old Emmy. Emmy is the 4th born of 5 children each from a different father each killed from different effects of the LRA's reign of terror over northern Uganda. One killed in combat; another died a political prisoner. But Emmy's dad had a much quieter killer - one that has now turned on his mother and could possibly take his own life as well- HIV/AIDS. In Uganda "Orphan" is a dirty word. It is highly frowned upon to let your family (no matter how far removed) to suffer. It then becomes the responsibility of the community to ensure that no child becomes invisible. Oftentimes this is a burden but other times it becomes a surprising source of joy. Viewers watch as 14-year-old Emmy finds his place in the world through a family bound together by necessity; and as a broken family tree discovers re-growth.
