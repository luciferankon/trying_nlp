Emily Schultz's beautifully realized novel is a mix of satire thriller and serious literary work. With biting satiric wit The Blondes is at once an examination of the complex relationships between women and a merciless but giddily enjoyable portrait of what happens in a world where beauty is - literally - deadly.
