'The Leviathan' serves as a parable of the inner-struggle of identity between the conscious and the unconscious-self lurking within the fathomless of depths of the abyss of the sea of the subconscious. Hidden powerful yet ever present this deep dark presence churns the salty brine of our deepest and darkest thoughts; rippling unbidden to the glassy surface of the waking mind. Juxtaposed with monochromatic garments and set against the unforgiving landscape of Melbourne's Black Rock Beach this visually moody tale plays out the silent war between the inner-self.
