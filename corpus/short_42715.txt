An off-screen narrator introduces us to Andy a three-and-a-half year old orangutan that lives at the Bronx Zoo. We see at least one animal for each letter of the alphabet; almost all are filmed at the zoo. Aided by a male keeper Andy visits a few: riding on a camel and a tortoise feeding an apple to a rhino and watching lions; or a few animals visit him. He's wary of a skunk and a frog. The narrator provides a few facts: where an animal is from what it eats or some distinguishing feature and talent. A few letters of the alphabet get more than one animal. The soundtrack begins and ends with children singing their A B C's.
