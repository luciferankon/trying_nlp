It is execution day in Huntsville Texas. Texas is the death capital of the United States. Anti-death penalty activists and the friends and supporters of condemned killer Mark Stroman gather outside the Death Unit to protest Stroman's execution. Stroman's case is a high-profile case in the United States because his motive for killing his victims is linked to the 9/11 terrorist attack. Some believe that Stroman is a changed man and should not be executed. Even one of Stroman's victims Rais a Bangladeshi-American who survived Stroman's attack has forgiven Stroman and wants the execution stopped. Stroman is the so-called 9/11 killer a former white supremacist who shot and killed people of Arab looking descent after the 9/11 terrorist attack. The normal execution time of 6pm has passed and the Supreme Court are still considering Stroman's case. This delay by the Supreme Court gives Stroman's supporters and the activists hope. It means that Stroman's execution might not go ahead and be stopped. The clock continues to tick. Will Stroman die tonight or will the Supreme Court let him live? My daughter Victoria and I arrive in Texas from Sweden. Today is execution day in Huntsville Texas. Several activists and the friends and supporters of death row inmate Mark Stroman gather outside the Death House (i.e. Walls Unit) at Huntsville prison where all Texas Death Row inmates are executed. Stroman is already inside the death house and is being prepared for death. Everyone is nervous. Some of Stroman's supporters claim he has changed and a different man. They wonder if the Supreme Court will have mercy on Stroman and give him a last-minute stay to stop him being killed tonight. The normal execution time in Texas is just after 6pm. Time passes and there is no word from the Supreme Court which means that they might give Stroman a stay. Hope begins to rise in Stroman's supporters. Will he die today or not.....?
