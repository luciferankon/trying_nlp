Hope of Finding a Son: The Maurice Red" Jefferson Story is a documentary that tells a story of a 16 year-old boy known to his family friends and the people in his town as "Red". He was a choirboy at the Piney Grove First Baptist Church in Fort Lauderdale; and he played junior varsity basketball at Dillard High School where he was a student. Red had a bright future ahead of him carrying aspirations of becoming a doctor one day. On November 28 1983 around 3:30pm Red left his home where he resided with his grandmother Ethel Mitchell 74. He was headed to basketball practice at Franklin Park basketball court but he never made it there. "It's like the Earth opened up and swallowed him" said his grandmother who still lives in the Fort Lauderdale house she shared with Maurice before he disappeared that Monday afternoon.
