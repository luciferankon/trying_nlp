Italian millionaire Moritz Craffonara dreams about 'a bed under the stars'. He asks his friend Ross Lovegrove for help and the British designer constructs something that nobody thought was possible: a floating space capsule on top of a 2100 meter mountain in the heart of the Alps. The project was named "Alpine Capsule" and gained media attention all over the world. But eventually it is something way bigger: It became Moritz' monument. A documentary about the limits of modern technology and the human fear of being forgotten.
