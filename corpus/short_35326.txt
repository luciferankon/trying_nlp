A timid and clumsy young man is looking for a room through newspaper ads. A young lady answers his phone call. When he arrives to the apartment with his suitcase he finds the young lady in the company of a baby girl entrusted to her by her brother. Soon another young man arrives wearing trendy sunglasses and with a bold behavior which contrasts with the shy demeanor of the first one. They each try to entice the young lady. One maneuver tried by the bold guy is the cigarette/steam locomotive trick later to be seen in Jules et Jim. The shy young man tries his luck again but finally they both give up. Together they leave the apartment and the young lady who is shown both relieved and disappointed. This short film was disowned by Truffaut but it can be considered a prelude to the "love trio" theme found in several later films by Truffaut.
