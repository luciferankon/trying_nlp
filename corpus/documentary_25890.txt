Former football star David Ginola puts his real-life healing powers to use with his own exclusive A-lister retreat. Catering to a hush-hush roster of celebrities looking to unwind David's spa The Centre - which bears the slogan "Be well be safe believe" - is nestled in a top secret location in Wiltshire. "The Centre is very important to me" says the French sporting ace of the relaxation getaway. "It's about trust and it's about truth." While David has been keeping mum on the details of his hideaway for the rich and famous he recently allowed TV presenter Eamonn Holmes and a camera crew to shoot footage at the spa. "The Centre has been shrouded in secrecy" said a representative for BBC3 which will screen the hour-long programme on September 19. "But David has now agreed to let in cameras for the first time to show life behind the closed doors of his newest most fascinating project."
