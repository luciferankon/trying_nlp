In Apart/Together 2009 Fleming spent months filming coup pigeons from a Brooklyn rooftop. The video is broken into three parts or perspectives: the macro structure of the birds the individuals composing the group and the individual point of view. The mesmerizing flight patterns of the flock mimic human flow of the city below; the cooing pigeons sublimate the noises of the city. Birds is a hypnotic visual and auditory meditation on objectivity.
