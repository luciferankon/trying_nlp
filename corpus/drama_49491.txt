We are in the year 2002 the sisters ALICE (26) and HELENE (18) just lost their grandmother who raised them. Left at a small farm in the fjords of Norway Alice decides for the first time in her life to ask for help. Her good friend ELIZABETH (25) from the US catches the first flight she can and brings her friend WILL (23) to help out. Alone at the farm they all have time to think about their past and are forced by the silence to meet their demons.
