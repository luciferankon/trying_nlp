The Sisters Plotz is a surreal frothy musical romp inside the world of three eccentric heiresses: Dada poetess Celestia manic inventor Ladybug and dreamy painter Whimsellica. The sisters live in New York City with their darling butler Reginald. Hilarity ensues when they must outwit a snooping gossip columnist a councilwoman set on turning the Plotz home into a carousel and two scheming maids who plan to steal the ladies' riches and bet everything at the track. The film is a loving nod to old Hollywood as seen through a camp indie lens. Imagine Grey Gardens directed by John Waters and choreographed by Busby Berkeley.
