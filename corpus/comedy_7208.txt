The Love Echo is the not true story of the rise (and fall?) of a sensational American pop duo whose immediate success and popularity in Europe has given them a once in a lifetime opportunity to top the U.S. Pop charts. There's one problem (o.k. there are many): The singer Renard may be in love with his straight guitar player Jackson. Can the band survive the savage music industry their egos and each other long enough to grab the Rock and Roll brass ring?
