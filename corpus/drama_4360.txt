Imagine it is summer and that for the last several days Montreal has been swimming in sweltering heat and smog. Then imagine that you are in the city's downtown core and a woman holding a small video camera approaches you. She asks you to participate in a one-question survey. Although you are slightly wary of this proposal you stop to listen. She asks you: "What does happiness mean to you?" and awaits your answer. Go on! What are you waiting for? Answer! HAPPINESS IS A SAD SONG tells the disjointed story of Anne-Marie an unemployed publicist pounding the pavement in Montreal with her mini-cam collecting testimonials on the subject of happiness. It is happiness that she appears to seek or understand to the point of being obsessed by her quest. Guided by serendipity and a series of surprising and varied encounters Anne-Marie dives head-first into her project. She meets a medley of characters whom she engages in engrossing thought-provoking discussions about happiness. Anne-Marie moves from one character to the next from one idea to the next in her survey gathering reactions and challenging viewpoints that give her a chance to reflect upon her own life. How can her obsession be explained? Why the survey? And why the video camera?
