The series takes place 18 months from now. An unnamed apocalypse has wiped out a large percentage of the population. The Information Age is a nostalgic memory. We follow Arthur Ruth Virgil and Cat who live in "the castle" a fortified house in the woods in a post-apocalyptic world. They tackle the hard truths about trust companionship and what it means to be "civilized" in a world that is clearly not. Our heroes are living day-to-day and haven't thought beyond that until an unlikely intruder shakes things up in the castle and gets them thinking about more than just survival. What will they do when their neighbors are insane cultists nomadic killers and cannibals? That's what they have to figure out as they navigate the new DARK AGE.
