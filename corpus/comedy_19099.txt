A young woman (Diane Hart) arrives at a Scottish university to visit her uncle (Joseph Tomelty) a famous writer now employed as a humble porter who went into hiding during the Irish Civil War some thirty years earlier. The principal of the university (Patrick Barr) assumes she is his new secretary and she falls in with this. A senior professor (Duncan Macrae) starts a campaign to improve the morals of the students and enlists his pompous son (Charles Hawtrey) in his crusade with farcical results.
