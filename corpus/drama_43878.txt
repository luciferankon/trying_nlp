A brutal sadistic overseer runs a pearl-diving operation on a South Seas island and treats the natives terribly torturing them and violating their women. A local native girl falls in love with him despite his sadistic tendencies and things come to a head when the locals can't put up with any more of his brutality and take matters into their own hands.
