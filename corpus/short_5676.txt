'CANICULE' (translation : 'HEAT WAVE') is a short film that takes place entirely during an apartment party on a hot summer night in Paris. The viewer follows the path of Lou our 26-year-old leading lady as she goes through various situations -reuniting with a former flame meeting new people celebrating the departure of her closest friends abroad...- while also slowly realizing she is not as happy and fulfilled personally / career-wise as she thought she was. Lou appears to be at a crossroads in her life. A chapter will close that night leaving room for a brand new start.
