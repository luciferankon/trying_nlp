What is your worst fear? It's a harmless question to ask when you are in the frozen woods taking part in a sociology experiment with Professor John Sola. (Eric Roberts.) But it's not so harmless when a madman turns those fears into reality. Your friends are murdered in gruesome ways one by one and the only way you know somebody is not the killer is after they turn up dead. Trust fades tensions mount and the body count rises until the final desperate confrontation of good and evil. Be prepared for anything when the twisted motives behind this murder spree are revealed.
