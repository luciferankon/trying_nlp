In the year that Kodak files for bankruptcy print photography and the part it has played in our lives is more relevant than ever. Rene Bill and Janet where found in a box of old 1970's Kodak prints in the late 1990's in a junk shop in Hackney. All I know of their lives is from what is written on the back of the snapshots. This small film center's around a holiday to Scotland. They record themselves with their camera for posterity for history not knowing that I will find them years later and their lives will become important to me.
