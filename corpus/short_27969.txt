The year is 1961. The Space Race has been on for four years now. The Soviets have just successfully launched the first man into orbit around Earth. The United States has yet to accomplish so much. They are in fact losing this race! One woman and the small group who recruited her want to change that. Sarah Boyd is the first female pilot to try the same medical tests that the Mercury 7 Astronauts went through. Surprising to everyone around her she is actually doing well - in fact as good as the men. The problem is that no one is paying attention to her. So instead of waiting around for forever she calls up a reporter for a big magazine to get national attention to the women's astronaut program and to change history.
