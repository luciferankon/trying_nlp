Who's Hungry is part of an ongoing series of experimental tabletop puppet plays that give a voice and face to hunger. Produced and written by Dan Froot designed and directed by Dan Hurlin with music by Amy Denio the plays aim to raise awareness of the lives of those of us who on a daily basis must choose between life's basic necessities - food or rent food or medicine food or bus fare. This installment in the series tells the oral histories of five very different homeless and hungry Santa Monicans through five 15 to 20 minute segments woven together much as a chef weaves a succession of flavors into a cohesive multi-course meal. Overall the project incorporates a range of puppetry styles in order to give each of the five stories its own aesthetic treatment. Presented on a specially built 24-foot dinner table the audience views the action from one side as if they are banquet guests. Incorporated into the evening are Delft china Matchbox cars televisions rod puppets as well as puppets inspired by Japanese Bunraku and much more.
