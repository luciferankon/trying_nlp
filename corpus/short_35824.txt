Vincent is at his office and would like to go on with his work. But at the moment he just can't as his mother is monopolizing him on the phone. She is preparing the funeral mass of her deceased mother (and Vincent's grandmother) and solicits her son's contribution - which being an atheist he does only half willingly. While he is in contact with his mother a second phone rings on another line: news is brought to him of the birth of a new child in the family. Oddly enough the two conversations one about death the other a bout a new life juxtapose and intertwine.
