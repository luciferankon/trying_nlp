Boni Mok is a depressed and hard-working advertising exec who's ideas have just been plagiarized and presented to her superiors by her lazy and self-absorbed subordinates before she is aware of this. Boni is then accused of plagiarizing her fellow employees and is dismissed. Boni goes home and falls asleep. When she wakes up she discovers she is repeating the previous day somehow. She is inexplicably forced to repeat the same day (March 19) over and over again until she may discover who wronged her. As Boni relives the same day she becomes closer to her subordinates and digs her way out of her depression.
