Loosely based on the fairy tale "Little Red Riding Hood" by Charles Perrault RED is a stylized thriller that blends a Southern Goth setting with Victorian era parlour tricks. A young woman travels to visit her sick Grandmother when she stumbles upon a juggling rogue quick to intercept her plans. Through fire breathing magical flowers and blood stained windows a history of malice and deceit is pieced together for one final chase through the woods.
