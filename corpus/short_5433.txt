Double Act is the story of comedy performers (Chris and Tel) and their relationships with their wives (Vicky and Donna). It's about love betrayal revenge and feathers. Chris and Tel are going through their 3rd rate act at a working men's club in Leeds while their wives sit in the audience. Flashbacks take us to moments over the last three months when the straight man (Chris) and the comic's wife (Vicki) have been having an affair. We learn that Vicki plans to reveal all that night but Chris is a proud violent man and when he points a loaded gun at Tel on stage nobody is quite sure whether to laugh or call the police.
