Besides Romuald Karmakar's movie "Villalobos" (and his contribution to the marathon movie/documentary "24 hours Berlin") there wasn't much official video footage shot at Berghain and Panorama Bar. For the arts project "After Hours" Berghain now opened its doors for the camera. Steffen Koehn and Phillip Kaminiak follow wild animals on their way through the monumental spaces of the former power plant. The short movie "After Hours" is on display until May 26th as part of the exhibition "Culture:City" (alongside with architectural models of Berghain and other contemporary cultural temples) at Akademie der KÃ¼nste Berlin.
