On June 27 1997 from 9:46 to 22:58 Herbert Achternbusch paints a fresco which covers an area of 20 x 8 meters. Even as a painter Achternbusch is radical a pioneer of knowledge. He is an optimist. and paint hope. He's making a film in two weeks writes a play in five days and paints as if the sun would not rise again the next day. This way of working this vortex is the hallmark of his work.
