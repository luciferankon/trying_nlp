After an escalator accident at a small town mall young fat Katrina Shaw turns into super model thin Kat who follows her agent/sugar-daddy/husband and his kitten all the way to Hollywood. Unfortunately by the time she realizes that looks will only take her so far in a lala land where everyone is hot her mother has died of cancer and her promiscuous husband is all she has left in the world. While he's busy running around she becomes obsessed with ideals of youth and beauty and undergoes enough plastic surgery to land her her first starring role--as "the Kat" at the Circus Circus Casino. Luckily even beautiful people have a capacity for genius as it will take more than just Kat's giant heart to break her out of this cage.
