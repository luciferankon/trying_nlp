On the holidays ten years old Adam and his little sister Otka four years junior to him travel from a village Vyk√°n to their aunt to Prague. Their parents left for Hungary to the world championship in ploughing. The children have the address but they do not know the way to the Northern Town. They set out for a place on foot across the historical parts of the town.
