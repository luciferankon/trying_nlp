Laughter and pathos abound in this warm-hearted portrait of millennials navigating the bumpy roads and rainy back-alleys of life and love in Vancouver. An angsty frustrated artist hijacks an earnest dance piece and tries to bend it to his overwrought vision. A people-pleasing former dancer struggles to redefine her womanhood after some troubling medical news. A man-eating ass-kicking barista races to stay one step ahead of her turbulent past. A fragile choreographer tries to keep an even-keel and rebuild her career while her boozing sister sucks all the air out of her living space. An exotic dancer with dreams of performance art glory tries to balance her burgeoning confidence and her ambivalent feelings toward her married boyfriend. A recent Iranian immigrant bobs and weaves her way through the strange landscape of her adopted home. And a free-loading accidental guru meanders through the lives of all of them dropping pearls of wisdom while trying to secure her next place to crash. And of course its all about love...approximately.
