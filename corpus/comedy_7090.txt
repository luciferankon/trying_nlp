Wayne shares his reaction to the final Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens trailer. "As a geeky Star Wars fan I got swept up in the furore and excitement surrounding the release of the first Force Awakens trailer and decided to record my premier 'fan reaction' video whilst viewing it for the first time. Unfortunately however I never posted it because I had a bad cold at the time of filming and was a little self-conscious about my snivellin'-and-a-hackin'. With only a day left to release of the actual movie however I find myself once again gripped by the Star Wars hype-machine and have decided (for better or worse) to share my trailer reaction. Enjoy - and May The Force Be With You."
