Indie Truth takes a keen look at how some of the world's most accomplished and groundbreaking documentary filmmakers have captured the truth on film. This IFC Original features interviews with Barbara Kopple D.A. Pennebaker Chris Hegedus Allan King Albert Maysles Simcha Jacobovichi and Peter Lynch. "A documentary at the end of the day is still storytelling and like any great movie the audience is hooked by the story and the characters" says director Carl Bessai. "These people are really just great writers; their pen is the camera and their paper is the film medium and I think this film is great; not because I made it but because the people in it have each done great things. In one hour you can sample some of the finest documentary moments ever."
