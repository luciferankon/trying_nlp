Yodi wanted more than anything to find out if the stories about the curse associated with the horror movie Jelangkung were true. He had heard that if someone watched the movie alone they could be haunted by spirits. Despite his friends warnings against it he was determined to make contact with the spirit who was sacrificed when the first Jelangkung movie was made years before. Unfortunately for Yodi he discovered that wishes can come true.
