In the follow-up to the outrageously funny and wildly successful past shows: 2012's "What's Wrong With People?" and 2014's "Aren't You Embarrassed?" comedian Sebastian Maniscalco asks "Why Would You Do That?". Filmed at the legendary Beacon Theatre Sebastian continues to deliver his signature comedy style that blends high-energy physical acts-outs and hilariously demonstrative facial expressions.
