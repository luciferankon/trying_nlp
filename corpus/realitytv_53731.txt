Driven By Vision explores fantastic eccentric sites that have sprung from the fevered imaginations of talented visionaries who felt compelled to share their visions. Multicolored towers gardens grottoes cathedrals and tin shacks hidden down back alleys of urban centers and miles down the country roads not taken in rural North America. Driven By Vision presents portraits of the sites that have healed believers amused skeptics confounded clerics confused city officials and bewildered building inspectors all gathered together for the first time in a colorful kaleidoscope of mirth madness and magnificence.
