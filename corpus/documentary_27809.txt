LT22 Radio La Colifata is a radio station run entirely by the patients of the J.T. Borda Psychiatric Hospital in Buenos Aires. Recorded and broadcast from the hospital gardens it is heard the world over. It is a station that questions the limit between madness and reason a station that breaks down the dividing wall between the "sane" and the "mad". It gives the word to those a voice has been denied for too long - "the mad" - who can also show us the many things that we the "sane" are incapable of seeing.
