More than anything else in the world forty year old Maud wants a child of her own. It is such an overwhelmingly strong feeling that it takes over every aspect of her existence. To get her life back into perspective and to help her confront her grief she forces herself to watch happy families picking up their kids from school. On her way home she feels a little better and starts flirting with a man on a bicycle who is waiting at the other side of an open canal bridge. But as the bridge closes she suddenly sees his little boy sitting in the child seat of his bike. As they pass each other on the bridge they exchange looks; his exploring hers confused. At that precise moment a speeding car ploughs into his bike throwing the little boy out of the child seat and into the murky waters of the canal. Maud is in shock but realizes the child is in the water and jumps after him. In a physical and emotional struggle under water Maud desperately tries to save the little boy until she realizes she has no choice but to let go of him - along with her deep desire for a child of her own. In the street everything has gone back to normal again. The only thing that remains of the accident is the wreckage of the broken bike - without its child seat
