The Horácek family has finally become an owner of awaited new Skoda car. The car however must be garaged and there is a desperate lack of space. Daddy Horácek ('Darek Vostrel' (qv)) lawyer publishes advertisements and asks everywhere around. Finally he gets a tip from his former client. The space in question is not exactly a garage but an old shed whose owner is the old man Andrýs ('Bohus Záhorský' (qv)). Horácek visits him with his nine-year old son Mísa ('David Schneider (III)' (qv)). The old man keeps a broken-down old car and lots of rubbish in his shed and most probably would agree with the sale but is very hesitant. He keeps putting off the decision only because he has become very fond of little Mísa and thus the visits continue.
