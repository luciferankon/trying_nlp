Seventy years after the 1929 Hebron massacre directors Noit and Dan Geva bring us the personal testimony of 12 people who survived the atrocity. Noit Geva's grandmother who was only 16 years old at the time of the massacre was so traumatized by the event that she never spoke of her experience but recorded what she witnessed in a journal entry entitled "What I Saw in Hebron." This gripping documentary allows a rare glimpse into a little-known moment in Israel's history.
