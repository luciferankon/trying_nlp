The flower meadow is home to countless species of animals. Some live underground some among the blades of grass and others populate the colorful canopy. It's a genuine paradise but one that is increasingly rare. This award-winning documentary is a technical tour de force that uses time-lapse photography special effects and CGI to track the development of one meadow back to the ice age.
