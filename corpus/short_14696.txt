MESSAGE is a documentary video art that acts according to aspects of the Brazilian reality. Welket Bungué places himself in the place of the self-represented subject using the symbolic action to talk about the case of the citizen Cláudia da Silva Ferreira a resident of the Morro da Congonha in the north zone of Rio de Janeiro who was fatally shot by PM's (Army Police) on the morning of 16 March 2014. In a critique of disinformation perversity and alienation as a result of today's incoherence of the media MESSAGE is a sensitive evocative about dehumanization and perverse isolation to which peripheral communities and their residents are being victimized.
