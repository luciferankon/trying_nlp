My name is Norro and I am a 12-year-old Dassanetch girl. Not long ago they circumcised me and also my sister Nohode. It is a very ancient custom in my land. If we didn't have it done nobody would respect us. We would not be able to get married or have kids. We would be alone rejected by everybody. This documentary explains the history of Norr√≥ and Nohode two Dassanetch sisters that were subject to circumcision. We will live alongside them and their family during the days before the ritual is held. Through their words and gestures we will learn what they think and why this deep-rooted tradition is practised.
