Lala Haricharandas lives an impoverished lifestyle along with his wife; an unemployed slacker son Raj; an ill daughter Paro who dreams of being a writer; and a younger son Chota. He makes just Rs.80/- per month working for a Marwari employer and after paying for Paro's medication has barely enough to make ends meet. One day he brings home Rs.1000/- from his office Raj finds it and gives it to his friend Kundan. When the former's employer arrives to take the cash back Raj ridicules him and he has Haricharandas arrested and sent to prison. With no money coming in Haricharandas' wife is forced to sell her belongings but nothing will prepare her for the shock when she will be told by Dr. G. Ghosh that Paro's illness is very serious and she must be quarantined before it spreads to the rest of the family.
