Hip√≥lito is a self-made man who went up in life in devious ways and used for profit the social turmoil when Portugal changed from a monarchy into a republic and then to a military regime. Finally he is forced into exile. Back in 1935 to family friends and lovers he is in a mix-mesh of lies and scheming again.
