Pechudo is a magnificent jet-black stallion who epitomizes the adjective "freedom." Running wild in Mexico Pechudo and his running mates are constantly being sought out and captured by ranchers. Time and again however Pechudo would elude capture then return and seek out his fellow mustangs and free them and the adventure would repeat itself. Finally Pechudo is indeed captured. He finds an ally however in a young boy who convinces his father to let him keep the beautiful horse and try to train him.
