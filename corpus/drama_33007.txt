The movie like the play "The Noose" on which it is based is the story of a young man sentenced to be hanged for murdering a racketeer because in order to protect others whom he admires he refuses to offer justification for the killing either in court or afterward. Everyone involved wants the sentence to be commuted but the law is implacable.
