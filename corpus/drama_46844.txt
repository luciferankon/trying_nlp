We follow this dreamy couple as they begin to live their own personal dream of sharing each moment together. Jesse has arranged a surprise dinner party in Luke's honor and has invited several friends to welcome him into village life which is an innocent and loving thing to do until it descends into a nightmare that simply doesn't want to end. As the alcohol flows freely tempers begin to flare and the conversation gets heated and then just one more unwelcome guest; a guest that insists on joining the party and delivering a brand of brutal truth that captures the attention of the rowdy bunch and one that is about to unlock the very darkest of secrets.
