A documentary film similar in its ambitions to the Struggle of the team of Eight but much more limited in its thematic breadth. The subject is the situation of the blind in our country who for the most part are reduced to begging in the streets while the Greek church rather arbitrarily manages the only asylum for the blind in Kallithea and at the same time tries to support their struggle for better living conditions. This struggle was manifested in their occupation of the School for the Blind and their wider conflict with all the repressive mechanisms of the state.
