This is the whimsical story of a young man who breaks up his family by bringing them together. Since his mother died 18 year old Michael fears anything which threatens the stability of his home life. However his father is about to move to Sweden for a year taking his sisters with him. Michael has already received confirmation of a place in Cambridge but would prefer to stay at home with his family 'mothering' them a role which he has naturally graduated towards. He decides to tell his father that he has not been accepted at University assuming that he will now be going to Sweden with the rest of the family. His father however does not consider this to be an option. Michael is distraught and believes that he will lose his role as surrogate mother unless he takes drastic action. He plots to fiendishly destroy the links which the rest of the family have established with the outside world.
