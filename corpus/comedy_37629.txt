Nate is a neurotic recently laid-off investment banker. Joe is his unemployed morally questionable hustler roommate. Unable to find gainful employment (or pay for his impending wedding) Nate secretly tags along on Joe's work-for-hire Craigslist adventures. Each episode follows the pair as they blaze a trail through a world in economic crisis trying on new hats (and hamburger costumes) as they learn the rules of survival.
