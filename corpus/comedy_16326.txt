Funny bitter irreverent and unmedicated. Think David Letterman on the street Michael Moore for documentary style add a touch of Attention Deficit Disorder and you've got Great Scott!!...television that bothers you. Join our host as he wanders the streets in an effort to satisfy both his curiosity and natural bothersome behaviour. From trying to get a simple glass of water in an apartment building to giving away a free breakfast of bacon and eggs cooked on the hood of his producers car our host spends the better part of each episode getting himself out of the trouble he got himself into in the first place. So lock your doors and bar your windows because it's Great Scott!! ...television that bothers you.
