On Disc 2 Paul Wookey journeys to investigate the universal ghost and spirit experience joined by psychic medium Diane Howe. We travel to Pendle known for its deep history of witchcraft which many researchers feel is responsible for the abundance of paranormal activity in the area. We also visit the Anchor Pub based in the beautiful Dales of England revealing amazing insights and testimonies about paranormal activity in the UK. On Disc 3 we visit Scotland's most haunted and secret bunker from the second world war. During WWII numerous bunkers were created for the protection of the rich and powerful elite.
