The third short in a season of dramas about love finds Clare Holman as an art teacher attracted to a 15-year-old pupil. It whizzes along with a kind of naughty excitement that makes you wonder why school seemed like such hard work but because it's only half-an-hour long you might as well go with the flow and forget its implausibility. Smart funny and well constructed.
