Frankie and Mike two car fanatics set out for a long drive through the desert to reach the Barrett Jackson auction in Las Vegas. Frankie tries to race his 67 Dodge Dart and ends up breaking down half way there. The pair orders the replacement part they need from ebay motors and plan to meet "Joey" with the part in a town called Calico. Calico is a desolate ghost town and Frankie and Mike fin themselves at odds over cokes hot wheels and women. They mainly argue about who was the fastest drag racer Don "The Snake" Prudomme or Tom "The Mongoose" McEwen. Their very relationship embodies the competitive spirit these two racers had and currently maintain today. After a quick face off outside a saloon the two continue their journey through the desert to Vegas.
