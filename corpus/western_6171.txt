Set in the Hill Country of Texas during the late 1880s the Texas Rangers find themselves up against one of their own. Shane Stocksteal turns from Ranger to outlaw by committing murder and fraud to reach his dream of political power. In the process Captain John MacIntyre is killed and his daughter Kayla runs for her life to find help. Before she can reach safety she is kidnapped and beaten by Stocksteal's men. But just before she is taken she sends her horse running free in the hope that someone will find the letter for help in her saddlebags. Jake Landers a farmer with aspirations of being something more is working in his field when he sees a lone horse grazing in the tall grass. He investigates and when he finds the letter he is moved to help Kayla due to his strong conviction to always do what's right. This takes Jake from farmer to lawman and puts him face-to-face with both danger and his dreams of following in his father's footsteps.
