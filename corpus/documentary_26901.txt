In the essay Wang criticized the inequality and prerogative in the Communist Yenan that China still faces today. The documentary combines a historical search with sentiments and details we can relate. It incorporates oral history from those who lived through Wang Shiwei's times citations from writings by himself and his contemporaries and the writer-director's own reflections with rarely seen newsreels poignant animations and stunning visuals.
