Following his defeat Shang Tsung begs his master Shao Kahn to spare his life. He tells Shao Kahn that the invitation for Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down and if they hold it in Outworld the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan and restores Tsung's youth. He extends the invitation to Raiden who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The tournament is dangerous as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage and an Outworld victory will unbalance the furies and allow Outworld to subsume Earthrealm.
