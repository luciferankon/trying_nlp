Mexico is a country surrounded by beaches: its extensive coastlines have been the setting for the rise of unique cultures since pre-Hispanic times. For centuries men and women have found the sea to be their main source of work and food providing the rest of the nation with an immense variety of products that in recent times have reached world markets making Mexico a major fishing industry.
