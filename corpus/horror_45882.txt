Horror movie following the adventures of a group of students who enter the haunted forest Harrow Woods. With the aim of investigating the disappearance of horror novelist George Carney a group of students encouraged by Gary enter the forest where he was last seen two years ago. Uncovering more than they had bargained for - not least that the infamous 17th century witch Lenore Selwyn was burnt at the stake in Harrow Woods and died laying a curse upon the ground beneath her - the students soon find themselves in a battle for survival. In 1752 Lenore Selwin was branded a Witch and burned at the stake. As she struggled against the flames she cursed the very land that her ashes were left to scatter upon. Some say she never left and that if you call her name when near her abandoned house she will appear. When a group of students investigate the disappearance of a famous horror novelist in the same area they are forced to confront nefarious forces in the woods on a weekend of sheer horror.
