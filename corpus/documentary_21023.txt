The fall of the Berlin Wall gave us hope for the end of divisions. However 20 years later many walls be it of concrete metal or wire have been erected throughout the world. In the U.S.A. in Israel in Europe and in many other parts of the world. The aim of these new walls is not to prevent people from going out like in Berlin but to prevent them from coming in. In our so-called global world these walls are for us the evidence of a global crisis. In Mexico in Israel in Berlin we met those who live near these walls either their victims or their promoters. Everywhere we realized the same thing these walls violently incarnate the difficulty to communicate with each other.
