On one of his bratty son Eric's annual visits the plutocrat U.S. Bates takes him to his department store and offers him anything in it as a gift. Eric chooses a black janitor who has made him laugh with his antics. At first the man suffers many indignities as Eric's "toy" but gradually teaches the lonely boy what it is like to have and to be a friend. Down-on-his-luck former journalist Jack Brown struggles to make ends meet working as a night janitor at business tycoon U.S. Bates' department store. Under those circumstances the desperate for cash reporter will soon catch the attention of U.S. Bates' pampered son Eric who wants to take Jack home to be his playmate or better yet his living toy for one week. Eventually as Jack demeans himself to pay off his mortgage before long he will realise that underneath the boy's facade Eric is in fact a good kid in need of a real friend but above all an unhappy son in need of a real father.
