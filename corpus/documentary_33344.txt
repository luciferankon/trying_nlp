'We are Rwandans now no longer Hutu or Tutsi' Migi Hubert and Ndoli say twenty years after the genocide. The APR Football players are preparing for the match of the year. All three struggle with their past. Rwanda seems like success story but fear of the regime and mutual distrust simmer beneath the surface. How real is reconciliation? The stadium nearly explodes when APR the team of the army faces Rayon Sports the team of the people. Clearly there is more at stake. How strong is the regime's reach? Or is there hope for more freedom and possibly an open dialogue?
