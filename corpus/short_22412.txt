A closer look at the major stunt sequences in the film. Stunt team did a lot of pre-vis videos to show Francis what they envisioned for a scene and then waited for a yeah or neigh. The lumberjacks were on wires to help them be able to climb take after take. In the pre-visualization for District 8 Gale had a regular bow rather than a crossbow. The dam was a 100 ft wall of blue screen with the bridge built in front. The initial drop from the hovercraft was shot in the parking lot with a 100 foot blue screen. Inside the Marriot Marquis the doubles did the full 500 ft drop several times then the actual actors did a 50-75 ft drop on the bottom to make it feel real.
