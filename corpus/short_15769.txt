Stereomongrel is a ten minute experimental film which explores the effects of two disparate worlds colliding. Witnessed through the eyes of a gifted twelve year old girl high and low culture clash in the neutral battle field of a museum. Filmed in Super 35 mm Stereomongrel style can be described as "hyper supra and marvelous real" through the use of 3-D animation stop-motion animation and highly choreographed tableaux or set pieces. Genres that are blended and tweaked by this uniquely hybridized film include psychological/supernatural thrillers Italian horror movies from the 70s and 80s and the unattainable ideals - both physical and economic - found in hip-hop music videos and fashion magazines.
