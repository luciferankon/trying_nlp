Warren The Ape" a scripted comedy set within a fictional reality show chronicles the trials and tribulations of a D-grade celebrity puppet. A brash cantankerous out-of-work actor Warren 'The Ape' Demontague is attempting to clean up his act and scramble his way back into the Hollywood limelight. Having sampled a brief taste of success as a star on the former sitcom "Greg The Bunny" Warren's life has been in a downward spiral ever since the show got canceled. Over the past few years Warren has paid more attention to drinking drugs and women than his career which lately has consisted of seedy exploitation films and a regrettable string of skin flicks. When the opportunity for his own reality show arises Warren takes this chance to restore his celebrity status once again.
