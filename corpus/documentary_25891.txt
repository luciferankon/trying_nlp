Capital for the Canopy is an appeal for the implementation of an international REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) regime which would allow developed countries seeking to meet emissions-reduction targets to transfer funds to developing nations to preserve their standing forests. In documenting the environmental implications of continued deforestation and how to work towards resolving this problem the film incorporates various community perspectives from Colorado to Central America to Haiti and beyond. Capital for the Canopy seeks to highlight the forces driving deforestation and demonstrates that there are strong economic and social factors behind the use of forests by local residents. In doing so the film aims to dispel the notion that deforestation is a result of ignorance or lack of environmental concern by residents of developing countries but instead stems from a basic need to subsist on what is often very little income and in circumstances with few socio-economic opportunities. Through interviews with Central American government officials professors community leaders environmental activists and directors of non-profit organizations the film relates the story of the history of forest degradation and how the implementation of REDD currently represents the best option for reducing deforestation.
