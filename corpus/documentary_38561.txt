Under the pseudonym Ambivalently Yours I create drawings inspired by the messages that people write to me online. "Drawn Together / Dessinés(er) Ensemble" presents my Skype and in-person conversations with six different people from around the world who I met online as Ambivalently Yours. Half-documentary half-lyrical animation "Drawn Together / Dessinés(er) Ensemble" is a collection of fragments and feelings that explores feminism through a pink ambivalent lens.
