Chestnut Records was sitting pretty when 2012 rolled around. Their main artist - Danny Alamo - was fresh from the Betty Ford Clinic and ready to begin his sold-out national tour "Danny From The Rock". However during sound check on the opening night of the tour in Sydney he disappeared. It would be 6 weeks before he re-emerged back at the label office's front doors just as drug and alcohol-affected as before. As a result the label suffered heavily both financially and reputably with some of their signed artists moving on to other labels. As Danny was now indisputably unemployable along with the fact he was the only remaining successful and well-known artist signed with Chestnut it was decided that he would be kept on and given a second chance a decision which could breathe new life into the label or completely destroy it forever. The Chestnut Records Series details the day-to-day happenings of the various characters which make up the label their relationships their conflicts their unified goal of making Chestnut the label it needs to be and making Danny the artist he needs to be. Chestnut Records is set in Sydney Australia.
