Television's first treatment of "Charades" as played by Hollywood celebrities. The giveaway was the use of gestures that defined "film" "TV show" "book" or "song" as well as "small word (a an the)"and gestures for syllables number of words and expand or stretch . I remember later as I grew up that "Charades" used these gestures from the show I remembered in my youth as "Stump the Stars."
