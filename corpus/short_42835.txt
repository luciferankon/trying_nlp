In April 2002 South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth launched aboard the Russian Soyuz TM-34 mission for a 9-day 21-hour and 25 minute trip into outer space. In gentle disembodied voiceover he recounts his experiences of coming to understand Earth afresh by venturing away from it and viewing it from an entirely new perspective. This unusual avant garde short provides a moving and quietly stated environmental message through beautiful and somewhat "unearthly" imagery.
