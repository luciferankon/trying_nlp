Locked in a cell for 48 hours three emotional archetypes battle for psychological supremacy before they can be destroyed by their own weaknesses. Subjects of a perverse scientific experiment they are left unobserved with no rules no boundaries and no chance of help. Captured on video the result is a three-way Darwinian fight for survival in a Draconian prison hell. The resulting film was sent anonymously to the Metropolitan Police. Copies were also allegedly sent to major distributors and sales agents within the film business. Monk3ys is a dark satire on the deep psychosis that lays deep in us all and the industry that exploits it for entertainment.
