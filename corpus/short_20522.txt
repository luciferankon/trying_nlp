Across the U.S. farmers are discovering the benefits of high tunnels. NRCS can help producers integrate high tunnels into their operations. While they may look like greenhouses high tunnels are actually quite different. Greenhouses are usually constructed of glass and metal with plants grown in pots above the ground. High tunnels are polyethylene plastic or fabric covered hoop structures that can be assembled for a fraction of the cost with plants grown in raised beds or grown directly in the ground.
