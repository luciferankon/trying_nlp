Iconoclast photographer and documentarian Allan Sekula unfolds a series of variations shot in the Netherlands Spain Greece Japan and other maritime countries around two of his major obsessions: globalization and the sea. In this rumination on the sea as a "primordial source of sublimity" Sekula explores a matrix of narratives--Greek myths American movies and stories of longshoremen lost sailors and displaced populations--and rejects on the globalizing effects of Adam Smith's notion of the seafaring life as a form of gambling.
