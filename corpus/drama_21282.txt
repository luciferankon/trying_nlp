High school senior Solomon White pretty much has his future as a college lacrosse player laid out for him till a concussion has him seeing everything upside-down. Not knowing how long this condition will take to right itself Solomon meets lecturer Wren Woods at a support group for the visually impaired (mostly all blind as is she). With future plans at least on hold he begins hanging out with her who - along with Mrs. Buck (Solomon's English teacher) and Prof. Craig Parker (a writing mentor Mrs. Buck arranged for Solomon) - guides Solomon into becoming a man who can make decisions for himself and into considering accepting Christ in his life.
