Philippe Geubels a Belgian comedian wonders over many things. Sometimes he wonders about his life or about his future. However most of his ideas are what other people call nonsense. Can you learn a blind man to drive a car? Are people who say water-boarding isn't fun exaggerating? Unfortunately Philippe himself isn't exactly adventurous. To take his ideas to the test he has 2 volunteers (idiots) who find out the things he always wanted to know.
