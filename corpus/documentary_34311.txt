Remote and unknown this tribe is the most extraordinary we have ever observed. Well proportioned the inhabitants in this country are big and active. The Paris clans The Grenoble clans and the Bordeaux clans speak languages very different from one another. But they all consider themselves amongst what is known as the French tribe. - Mudeya Kepanga Papuan explorer Paris January 2006 After ten years exploring the tribes of Papua New Guinea French photographer Marc Dozier formed a close bond with the Papuans from the Highlands and mastered their language. Two of the warriors he was closest with are called Polobi Palia and Mudeya Kepanga. To repay the hospitality Marc invited the two to visit his homeland of France. This "reverse exploration" motivated by great curiosity and friendship offers the explorers Polobi and Mudeya the unique opportunity to discover what it means to be French. Their observations from a completely opposite cultural basis reveal much about both worlds. Originally intended to be a four-part series for Canal+ this movie features a one-hour "Best Of".
