Ten years after the terrorist attack against the AMIA this documentary highlights unknown aspects as well as ties to the terrorist attack to the Israel embassy. From the investigation held by journalist Juan Salinas this documentary shows the mistakes in the instruction process as well as the absence of attention paid to information sources which due to lack of investigation obstructed the capacity to determine whether there was a connection to Middle Eastern terrorist organizations. The aspects are to this date ignored by a large number of Argentina's public opinion. They are analyzed through the reconstruction of the facts from a new and novel point of view. This new approach focuses on the relation of the attacks and the money laundering network the coexistence between state functionaries and weapon smugglers and the possibility that the attacks might have been the result of disputes among international criminal groups.
