The staff of Moses was divided into three and each part hidden by Jack Winterburn in 1932. Staff hunters some good some evil find parts of the staff but somehow the staff always seems to get away from them and then present its self to the next disciple of the staff who unwittingly carries it on its journey. That journey is the reunification of the staff to be one again. And so the Staff pieces continue their quest through the ages to be re-united once again.
