Affectionately known as La Pointe Pointe-Saint-Charles is a working-class neighbourhood in southwest Montreal. Once among the biggest industrial districts in Canada today it is under attack by real estate developers. With luxury condo towers springing up like weeds along the Lachine Canal residents of La Pointe are being priced out of their own neighbourhood in a real estate boom of epic proportions. The community is working hard to save their neighbourhood and their world coming together to promote a vision of urban development focused on social housing and community projects. A fabulous story of tenacity and solidarity.
