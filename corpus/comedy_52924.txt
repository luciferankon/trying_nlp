Matt and Henry: Working Together is a satirical comedy about two hypersensitive business 'partners' whose childish personal battles derail their attempts to achieve the success they so badly crave. The small office of Matt and Henry's failing digital media company is transformed into an emotional battleground when their minor disagreements are given an over-produced 'reality TV' treatment for comic effect. The series turns the completely unexciting aspects of Matt and Henry's office life into needlessly overwrought emotional experiences.
