Georgia O'Keeffe was an American abstract painter famous for the purity and lucidity of her still-life compositions. O'Keeffe moved to New Mexico in 1949 and is best known for her large paintings of desert flowers and scenery in which single blossoms or objects such as a cow's skull are presented in close-up views.
