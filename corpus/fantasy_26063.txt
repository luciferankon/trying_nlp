Eris awakens in a strange new place; she's not ink on canvas anymore. She befriends a homeless man calling himself Crow and under his guidance they set off for Crescent Star City. Along the way they meet a broken android with serial number C1471 and a cowardly arms dealer called Sid. Sid persuades them all to travel with him to Big Ed's Palace. Once at the Palace an air of menace hangs over proceedings until ultimately all the characters individually begin their next journey.
