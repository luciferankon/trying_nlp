We see footage of Ashes a young Grenadian man sitting on the prow of a fishing boat at sea at times smiling and grinning at the Super 8 camera filming him. The story on the soundtrack is told by Ashes' friends and was recorded by director Steve McQueen after he returned to the island in 2010 and found out that the young man had been murdered after he discovered a stash of drugs on a beach.
