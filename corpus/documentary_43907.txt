Every year thousands of conflicts are dealt with via a special jurisdiction process the Tribunal des Prud'hommes established in the 19th century to resolve management and labor disputes. It delivers a service that is swift free and accessible with straightforward primarily oral procedures. This court is a revealing social barometer full of stories dramas great and small. "Les Prud'hommes" crystallizes tensions upsets suffering and rebellions that are part of a rapidly changing ever more brutal and complex world of work. For the first time in Switzerland a camera crew has been allowed into the public galleries to film the Tribunal at work in Lausanne. The result is a caustic look at a very particular form of theatre a play of words and emotions bosses versus workers accompanied or not by a lawyer or union representative. Amusing and moving by turn the film takes us into the heart of the human comedy that of contemporary society.
