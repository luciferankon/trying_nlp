This film charts the early stirrings of nationalism in the province of Québec Canada. Its gradual growth and its culmination in the Québec Referendum as seen through the careers of Daniel Johnson and his two sons: Daniel Jr. Vice-president of Power Corporation and a Liberal and Pierre-Marc former Minister of Labor in the Parti Québécois government. Unlike their father they have had to make the painful choice between Québec and Canada.
