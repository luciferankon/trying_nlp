A "reality show" that presented stories of real-life heroes from around the world. Using a combination of actual video footage re-creations and interviews with eyewitnesses and family members this show introduced America to people who had risked their lives to rescue others people who managed to save themselves by only the slimmest of margins and those who had somehow managed to survive against seemingly insurmountable odds.
