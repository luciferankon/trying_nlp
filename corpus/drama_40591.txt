Based on Jennie Ketcham's memoir published by Simon and Schuster the show chronicles a troubled young woman battling addiction who initially enters rehab center to drum up publicity for her adult entertainment alter ego but ends up actually starting her healing process. Confusing sex with self-worth addiction with love detachment with strength I Am Jennie is ultimately a tale of a woman who considers herself a work in progress but who finally understands that the only person she can truly afford to be is herself.
