A merry looking crowd of ladies and gentlemen are assembled on the depot platform and in their midst wearing a prison-like appearance can be seen the bride and groom. The train pulls into the station and the couple embark on their honeymoon trip. Then begins the throwing of old shoes rice and other things. Huge showers of rice are thrown upon the departing couple and the train moves out amid waving of handkerchiefs and throwing of hats and shoes. A pleasing subject.
