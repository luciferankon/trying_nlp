Night. A winding road. Two women alone. A moment of distraction. Headlights. A near collision. A car veers into a canyon killing the driver. THERE ARE NO WITNESSES. A moment to think. Do they report the accident and jeopardize a school funding grant? Does one woman turn in the other? What would you do?
