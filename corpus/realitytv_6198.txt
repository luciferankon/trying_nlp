I love being the center of attention. Jill Kussmacher is trying to conquer Hollywood! To make her dream come true she took a one-way ticket to Los Angeles the city where dreams can come true. And Jill doesn't only dream she also acts! The young woman from Berlin inherited the starting capital from her Grandmother - and she invests it by buying her first "food truck": "Germany's famous Bratwurst" serves as her admission-ticket to L.A. - but this is only the beginning because the woman from Germany actually has a completely different goal: Becoming a Hollywood-Star by starting off as a "Bratwurst-Princess".
