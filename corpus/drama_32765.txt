Isobel runs a bed and breakfast on the west coast of Scotland. One day she is confronted by a young man who is looking for somewhere to stay. He has no luggage and can't afford to pay to stay for the length of time he requires. They strike up a deal: he will redecorate the house from top to bottom in return for board and lodgings. It soon becomes apparent that he has something to hide but so does Isobel. Their uneasy relationship becomes more and more relaxed as the house begins to lose it's drab appearance but their shocking secrets force a terrible climax.
