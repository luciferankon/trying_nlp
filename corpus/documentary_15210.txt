A sequel to a blockbuster from 1977 was designed to be an R rated horror film. In the vein of "Jodorowsky's Dune" and "Death of Superman Lives: What Happened?" this documentary will explore a different group of aliens who were less cuddly than who we met in theaters in 1982. This film will also explore an alternate 1980's America as if the R rated version of the film had been released similar to Man in the High Castle.
