Henry and his computer have a thing going. Henry is usually holed up in his apartment downloading music files visiting sites that picture women. His only distraction is the occasional sound of love-making in a nearby flat. When the Trojan virus eats up every file on his hard drive Henry decides to try human contact. He puts on his best clothes and calls on the woman next door. Has the computer taught him anything about communicating with the opposite sex? Will she or any woman become the Apple of his eye?
