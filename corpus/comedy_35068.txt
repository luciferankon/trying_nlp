Johnny Kraaykamp is released from jail. His pal Rijk de Gooyer comes up with a plan to rent themselves out as handymen especially since Johnny is able to fix anything with just one slap of his hands. After getting a loan and a phone-number from auntie Toetje (who runs a thinly disguised brothel in Amsterdam) the pair of them set to work. Things get complicated when a developer named Koster wants to buy out Toetje in order to build a parking garage just as the 'Geen Paniek' business is starting to boom.
