The "Gnawa" is a Moroccan Sufi brotherhood. Its name derives from the Berber word "ignawƒçn". The Gnawa brotherhood celebrates the rite of "lila" (the Arabic word for "night"). It is the night of the Gnawa in which the celebrant "mqadma" who has summoned the lila awaits the arrival of the brotherhood in order to begin the ritual that will last the whole night.
