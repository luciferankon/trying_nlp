This educational DVD follows four climbers on single and multi-pitch rock climbs. From small moorland outcrops to mountain crags and sea cliffs watch the steps they take for a great and safe day's climbing. All with a slight pinch of Slackjaw warmth that captures why climbing can be such a special shared experience.
