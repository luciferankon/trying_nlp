The Allied world thought the victory was theirs and it was settled that way - with the surrender of German and then the bombs on Japan their conquest was secure or so they thought!!. The main mistake the allies made at the end of the war was that they spent way too funds and time hunting Hilter's elite soldiers and stealing the German technology before the Russians made their advance. Missing Obergruppehfuhrer Hans Kammler's so called fatal suicide on the 9th of May 1945 through many witnesses had confirmed his body then also rumors said he was captured by U.S. forces again if the rumors were true they executed the wrong man. Kammler escaped in his personal aircraft Junker Ju-390V1 with the real Luftwaffe commander General Field Marshall Robert Ritter Von Greim his double was taken captive by the U.S. in Austria and while in Prison in Sazburg sixteen days later he was killed by a spy and made to look like suicide before the U.S. could find out he was not the real Gerneralfieldmarshell Greim. They disappeared to South America with one third of the real scientists behind the German Elite weaponry and technology to join other scientist and engineers still building Hitler's secret weapons deep in a hidden base somewhere in South America which was untouched a sign the allies had no idea of its existence the base continued working and training elite troops at an accelerated rate. With the base hidden deep underground and well supplied during the war. With fifty thousand strong soldiers and pilots where their families lived in secret. They worked hard for two years unaware from anyone in the outside world but a few spies let alone the allies now ready they emerge from within the Earth with single manned aircraft and armor that have the fire-power of a four manned unit to strike a powerful blow upon their enemies. The Allies unprepared and unequipped loose instant ground as German and the Japanese quickly took back their countries and many other countries in the process.
