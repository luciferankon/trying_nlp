In December 2008 and January 2009 Operation Cast Lead saw Israel's military forces clash with Palestinians in Gaza. In the ensuing raids which sparked a wider humanitarian crisis and the collapse of infrastructure and basic services 1417 Palestinians were killed and thousands more were injured and many left permanently disabled. The majority were women and children. This is not a documentary about death toll statistics nor is it about politics or the roots of this particular episode in the ongoing standoff between these hostile neighbours. Instead we focus on the Samounis - a peaceful close-knit extended family of farmers. FROM UNDER THE RUBBLE is a high impact documentary that prompts us to examine the personal emotional and psychological toll of armed conflict on civilian populations in particular women and children. There are thousands of stories to be told from conflict zones and this is just one amongst them so extreme it challenges the audience to stand in the shoes of Zeinat Samouni and her seven children survivors of what has become known as the Samouni massacre in Gaza.
