Johnstown Flood tells a true story of heartbreak heroism and the courage to survive. On a stormy day in May of 1889 the South Fork Dam explodes unleashing a 40-foot wall of water. Fiercely thrashing at frightening speeds the flood devastates the 14-mile valley between the Conemaugh Lake and Johnstown Pennsylvania under the force of a 20-million-ton tidal wave. Johnstown Flood depicts this tragic event which claims more than 2200 lives and wipes out 99 entire families and is still considered to be one of the worst disasters in American history. Horrified survivors watch as the bustling industrial city of Johnstown is instantly reduced into a wasteland. The deadly torrent overcomes terror-stricken townspeople who are tragically lost in the flood. As the waters recede people from all over the world rally around the survivors to help victims regain all that is lost.
