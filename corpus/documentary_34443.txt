The Berlin Wall a civic tragedy in architecture falls on November 9 1989 and the void it left in the urban spaces of the German city are now filled with the world's most critically engaging architecture. Ten years and nine days later the Aggie Bonfire falls creating a civic tragedy in architecture of its own right albeit at a smaller scale. With this film as his final report Bradley Angell investigates whether a critically important redemption of the pyrotonic tradition is possible as the tragedy still leaves a void both in the spirit and the psyche of the campus. Reaching beyond the memorials that litter our urban spaces as emotional fillers for tragic events 10 Years & 9 Days is an engaging story of the manner in which we do not just remember our cultural heritage but redeem it in our structures and traditions in the face of the erosion brought by change in our globalized world.
