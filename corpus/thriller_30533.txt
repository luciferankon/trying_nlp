A number of leading Western scientists have been kidnapped only to reappear a fews days later. Unfortunately each scientist has been brainwashed and is now completely useless. The British send their agent Harry Palmer to investigate. Palmer is surprised to be selected for such a mission (considering his past) and believes he has been chosen because he is expendable. Harry Palmer is grudgingly still in the army after his boss got him out of detention camp. He is working in London for the intelligence service and finds himself moved to a unit investigating the disappearance of several top British scientists. Despite his truculence Palmer does get results and he is soon in contact with the man who could be behind the operation. Harry Palmer is an unconventional counter-intelligence officer. Although a sergeant in the army he is disrespectful of his superiors but does enjoy the finer things life has to offer. He is assigned to Major Dalby whose unit has been investigating the disappearances of several well-known scientists. Their most recent case involves Dr. Radcliffe and Dalby is prepared to pay a reward to get him back. When they do so they find that his mind has been wiped clean and the man is unable to function. Palmer also has an unfortunate encounter with a CIA agent whom he kills unintentionally. Now a target of the CIA as well as the kidnappers Palmer thinks he has solved the mystery of IPCRESS and the identity of the person ultimately responsible for the kidnappings.
