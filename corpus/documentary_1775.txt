Ralf and Johnny are expatriates who experience life in one another's country. Ralf is a young artist from Germany living in America. Johnny is a young artist from America living in Germany. Both made an art form out of life itself and believe that the new country of residence is the only place where an existence free from social and cultural expectations seems possible. However they made an unusual choice: being a foreigner. As Ralf and Johnny's lives are being documented over the course of one year their discovery of the "foreigner self" marks the beginning of a long and rocky road between finding and losing oneself. Moreover reality always seems to be catching up with people.
