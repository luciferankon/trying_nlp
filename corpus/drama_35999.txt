Whenever the Russians sent a satellite - a sputnik - into space during the early days of the space race a certain grammar school in the middle of England - Kettering Grammar School - picked up the signal. The teacher taking the science class in 1960 was Geoffrey E Perry later on to be awarded the MBE. This is the story of how that teacher at that particular school picked up the 'bleeps' from Sputnik 4 in May 1960.
