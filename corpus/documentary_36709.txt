Can a candidate with no political experience and no charisma win an election if he is backed by the political giant Prime Minister Koizumi and his Liberal Democratic Party? This cinema-verite documentary closely follows a heated election campaign in Kawasaki Japan revealing the true nature of "democracy." In the fall of 2005 40-year-old self-employed Kazuhiko "Yama-san" Yamauchi's peaceful humdrum life was turned upside-down. Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had suddenly chosen him as its official candidate to run for a vacant seat on the Kawasaki city council. Yama-san had zero experience in politics no charisma no supporters no constituency and no time to prepare for the impending election. The election was critical for the LDP. Yama-san's loss would automatically oust the LDP from its position as the dominant political party on the council. Thus the LDP forms a strong campaign team consisting of every LDP politician from the Kawasaki region to fight the intense battle against the party's opponents-all veterans of the Democratic Party the Communist Party and the Kanagawa Network. The campaign team invites many of the LDP's political big shots-Nobuteru Ishihara Yoriko Kawaguchi and even Prime Minister Koizumi himself-to back its inexperienced candidate-a rare sight for an election in a politically insignificant suburban town. Adhering to the campaign tactic of "bowing to everybody even to telephone poles" Yama-san visits local festivals kindergarten sports events senior gatherings commuter train stations and even bus stops to offer his hand to every one he sees. Can Yama-san win this heated race? Through its candid cinema-verite style camerawork this rare detailed documentary of a Japanese election reveals the true nature of "democracy."
