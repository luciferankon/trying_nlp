In this American Film Institute-subsidized short subject Fionnula Flanagan plays a sharp-tongued but compassionate nun while Peter Lempert is cast as a sullen emotionally disturbed boy. The title refers to the "thawing" process that occurs when the nun attempts to break through Lempert's wall of silence.
