But then Dirkie's twin sister (who went to live with their dad after their parents split up the previous year) arrives in town on a mission of her own: to be selected to go on Wave-Seekers a fictional World Surf Tour and something that Tiaan and Dirkie dreamt of doing themselves. But for her to succeed she needs Tiaan's help and by implication she needs him to get back on his surfboard...
