This award-winning documentary explores how something as simple as exercise can be used to address our society's seemingly impossible-to-solve challenges. The United States stopped teaching classical Physical Education 100 years ago which did not resemble 'PE' as it is known today. JFK tried to bring classical Physical Education back but that ended with his shortened Presidency. It wasn't about balls and sports; it was about addressing a basic human requirement...one we have ignored as a population and pay the consequences for its absence every day. This documentary explores the pivotal role Physical Education plays to develop smart productive and mentally stable citizens. It shows an eye-opening connection between the lack of activity today and the ever-growing burdens we face. This 4-year film project interviewed over 250 of the world's leading scientists physicians educators students and alumni. It's the most comprehensive look at 'why' we must exercise.
