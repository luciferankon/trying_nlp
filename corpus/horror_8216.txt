The ex-addicted and paranoid Renee and her fianc√© and former doctor Jeffrey move together to a remote house nearby the Mexican border. She meets Michael who works in the area taking care of wind mills and invites him to have dinner with Jeffrey and her. Sooner they find that the place is under siege of a hungry Mayan descendant family of zombies that was killed by an unknown murderer and cursed by an old ritual. When a young couple move into an abandoned house in the mountains they discover it's infected by an ancient curse brought on by the murder of an innocent Mayan Indian family. Whoever murdered them did not bury them properly - now the dead are walking - and they are very hungry. If you're warm and breathing you're surely to fall prey to the "Curse of the Maya".
