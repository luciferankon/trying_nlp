Lands of loneliness is a film about the search: the search for the roots for reconciliation with oneself and with others for a past that is gone for a reality that resists. A search for a language that explores the boundaries between fiction documentary film and dance. It is a film about the distances and above all a film around the need to approach what is deeply necessary for us. In short this is a film searching for reality. And reality must be touch. M贸nica a 47-year old dancer receives a call from Spain: her father is terminally ill. After 20 years M贸nica must return to the remote village where she was born.
