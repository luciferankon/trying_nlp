Before writing 1984 Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War against the forces of Fascism. Joining the POUM Militia he believed that if Fascism could be defeated in Spain it would halt the rise of Hitler. Along the way Orwell would encounter another enemy. One that would transform him and lead him to write his dystopian masterpiece 1984. Featuring an interview with Noam Chomsky 'Orwell's Revolution' explores Orwell's account of these experiences in Homage to Catalonia. As Chomsky is one of the few scholars to agree with Orwell's take on the Spanish Civil War the film explores our notions of history. With Ivens' classic film "The Spanish Earth" as its guide "Orwell's Revolution" develops a parallel narrative that explores the notion of documentary truth. Through techniques first developed by Ivens it examines the origins of the modern documentary questioning why it uses images that motivate rather than inform. The two narratives come together when it is realized that Iven's film is in conflict with Orwell's text. In a treatment that combines interviews archival films and historical documents Orwell's Revolution weaves an intricate web where the viewer is shown how history is written. It turns out that fake news has been with us for a long time. Even Hemingway was part of the game when he attacked Orwell's POUM in 'For Whom the Bell Tolls.'
