Incidentally an innocent couple Muku and Nayontara lives in an area of Dhaka city where supply of drinking water is limited. In summer water supply is ceased for a few days. Local dwellers stored some water for emergency but Muku and Nayontara have no water at all. So they beg water to every door. Nobody give them water but beat Nayontara mercilessly. Nayontara becomes revengeful and takes her revenge in different way.
