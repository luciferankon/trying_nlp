Harry is lonely. His dictatorial wife Amy just left for a marriage conference-and left him at home with a weekend's list of chores. He posts a status about his pitiful situation and suddenly his two college friends are at the door saying they're going to teach him how to be a man this weekend. He has no choice-he is now on a weekend "man date." His friend Ethan cannot believe how much his friend has sold out to become the lazy enslaved fool that he is. Thankfully Ethan just wrote a book called The Unmanly Man's Guide to Manly Manliness and Harry has violated every rule in it. Harry is now Ethan's student in manliness while their (flamboyant uncensored and ADHD) friend Dick is along for the ride. Ethan wastes no time in the Manly Boot Camp. He gets right down to business and teaches Harry how to be a man. Rules like "A Man Takes Pain Like Medicine" and "A Man Eats Like a Man" are learned by hilarious firsthand experience. Occasionally Harry's elderly outspoken neighbor Yolanda pipes in from the other side of the paper-thin wall. She and her dormant husband are always listening in to the guys sometimes interrupting at awkward times. As the weekend wears on they realize Harry has neglected his list of chores. Before Harry can finish Amy is at the door. Harry has to stand up to her interrogation and actually say things that she does not want to hear. She respects him and tells him some of the things she learned at the marriage conference. Though not necessarily apologizing Amy realizes she needs to be more humble and Harry knows he needs to become more of a man.
