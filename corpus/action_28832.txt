ACTION/THRILLER Red is the color that we pay the most attention to. It is the warmest and most energetic color in the spectrum. We associate red with love valentines danger desire speed strength violence anger emergency exit signs stop signs and blood. Red can evoke a fight-or-flight raise blood pressure and make the heart beat faster. Red would not be the color of choice for psychiatric wards prisons or a hospital. But for Bryan Kendall - Red is his mood. He had a wonderful life and a perfect existence: a perfect wife carrying their first child a perfect house and a perfect job - But then a crime was committed - a crime so horrible that not only does it rob him of everything and everyone he loves but also drowns him in a sea of anguish and a Mood of Red. Mild-mannered Bryan Kendall who believes firmly in the God of the Old Testament is driven to a psychological state if RED - a frame of mind where he takes his own revenge upon the perpetrating devils who shattered his once perfect existence.
