Bombay-based Ashok is a fast-talking conman who will do anything for a quick buck: cheat steal and even sell a laundry receipt as a lottery ticket. He has however written to his village-based mother that he is the owner of the Taj Mahal Hotel and is very wealthy though he lives in a small room in a chawl. Ashok meets with Seema and they fall in love. Seema has another admirer in Kumar who will do anything to marry Seema. He arranges so that Ashok's mother comes to know the truth about her son and Ashok's carefully-constructed world of lies and deceit comes crashing down.
