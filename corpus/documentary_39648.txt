When 6th graders in Utah learned that hundreds of birds are killed by striking airplanes at the Salt Lake City International (SLC) Airport they were determined to help decrease the number of birds flying near the airport which is located near wetlands and a migratory bird route. The group met with the airport wildlife staff including the USDA airport biologist to examine current methods to keep birds off the airport including predator calls robotic bait and remote trap setting. They learned that one method of scaring birds away is to set up an air dancer- a large brightly-colored tube that flaps when filled with air. However large commercial air dancers tend to be expensive and require generators that contribute to pollution in the area. In response they created a small portable battery-operated air dancer that is easily placed where birds nest and can run all day on a car battery. Through experimentation the team determined that it needed at least a 36" sock to get strong random motion. They tested various fans and air sock materials as they sought to create a dancer that could be placed under bridges and floated out on ponds. They tested their design at the airport and found that the only day that geese did not gather was the day their air dancer was used. They now have a provisional patent for their design. The air dancer is small so it can be used at any airport in multiple locations protecting birds from striking airplanes.
