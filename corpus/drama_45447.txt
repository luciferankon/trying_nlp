To be on a journey literally and metaphorically. This is what the characters of this story have in common when they are confronted with their substantial problems within a few days. The catalyst for this eruption of their individual conflicts are four hotel rooms of different standard. From a run down joint at the harbour to an oasis of tranquility and wealth right at the beautiful river Elbe. DO NOT DISTURB tells about the power of getting out and the love for feeling at home.
