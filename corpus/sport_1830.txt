There's no denying the impact that Mixed Martial Arts is having on the world of sports and sports entertainment. What was once an obscure and esoteric fighting style with a small fan base has gone on to become a major multimillion dollar industry filling basements pubs and barrooms with devoted followers. Detractors call it brutal governments treat it with hostility but there is no denying the draw of Mixed Martial Arts; it is a fight that is pure a fight that is completely unhinged a perfect display of two athletes willing to push the limits of the body; shedding blood sweat and tears in order to carve out one more victory... or fall at the feet of the others shadow.
