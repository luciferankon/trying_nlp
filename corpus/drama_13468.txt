In August 1966 the Cultural Revolution in full swing 13-year-old Tian Ben is arrested for playing a pop record; he's sent to a remote mountain camp in Niu-Peng. There he's called "Four Eyes" and with about 16 other older boys and men he's made to carry muck up a mountainside make bricks saw logs and sing daily to Chairman Mao of his faults. There's camaraderie among the five youths especially with a young pickpocket named Baimao and Tian is also drawn to a silent monk who cares for him when he falls ill and the others expect him to die. The camp is remote so there are no fences or walls. Tian longs to escape.
