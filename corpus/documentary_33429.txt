The face of war has changed. No longer do nations declare war on nations or line up armies on the battlefield. Today's wars are fought inside states between factions through the media from a distance. They are as likely to involve mercenaries and mafias as sovereign troops and as liable to be caused by climate change as colonialism. To deal with this mutating trend peacemaking too must change. Diplomacy and political influence have their place but today's truces are just as likely to be forged at the grassroots by ordinary people doing extraordinary things. For conflict not only to be resolved but actively prevented a web of interconnected influences must prevail ranging from the actions of individuals in communities through to United Nations resolutions. In this film Jonathan Holmes journeys to regions in crisis throughout the globe and meets the remarkable people who against the odds are de-escalating conflict and making peace in their societies. Their stories are measured against the thoughts of prominent intellectuals and the result is the creation of a cogent compelling series of proposals for peacemaking: proposals that crucially are practicable as well as theoretically valid. These are the stories of everyday people changing lives of war zones transformed and most of all of workable - and working - solutions to apparently hopeless situations. This film is a response to those who have ever wondered what their contribution could be or if the actions of ordinary individuals could ever make a difference.
