The Grogs were gonzo puppets who appeared on YTV alongside the PJs (Program Jockeys) in-between shows. Their colossal popularity led to the epic seasonal special 'Warren TV' which ran for the whole day on New Year's Eve 2003. Meanie Warren Grog hijacked YTV's broadcast signal and aired only his favorite shows.
