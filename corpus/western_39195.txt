The "Rough Ridin' Kids" really stir up a hornet's nest when they become suspicious of a man named Big John HArkins who is seen breaking in wild horses which are allegedly slated for the fertilizer-and-hide factory. At the same time large amounts of counterfeit fifty-peso notes begin flooding Arizona near the Mexico border. That brings a Mexican police-chief Juan Reyes posing as a bandit named Jalisco to investigate. A man has kidnaped an engraver and has him forging Mexican bills. He captures wild horses supposedly to sell for hides but uses them to transport the bills across the border. Youngsters Red and Judy see them breaking some of the horses and their report leads the Sheriff and Mexican Agent to investigate as to why horses would be broken that were only to be sold for hides.
