The film features 38 second-generation Holocaust survivors who responded to an invitation I posted on Facebook. I filmed everyone who agreed to take part and you'll see and hear them all in the film. I didnt ask specific questions  I just asked them to give a brief monologue on the things they find significant as second generation. They choose the film location.
