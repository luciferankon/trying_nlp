The series follows FARRAH and ROB a couple who are a year into their relationship. They have recently decided to take the next step and move in together. By doing so they have also simultaneously - and unconsciously - taken another big step: they have moved out of the lovey-dovey honeymoon phase of their relationship and entered in to the ever-tricky make-or-break stage. It is in this precarious minefield where the minutia grows into mountains and all those "cute quirks" become grating annoyances that they find themselves at the inevitable crossroads that every new relationship comes to: Should you go all in or bail out and move on? In an effort to weather this tempestuous stage of their fledgling couplehood Farrah and Rob have sought counseling and have been encouraged to record vlogs of their experiences within the relationship. Through this device the audience will get a one-on-one unfiltered inside look at the perspective of each side of the couple's struggle. And though every situation will appear to be both ridiculous and hilarious to the outsider anyone who's ever been in a serious relationship will be able to relate to where each character is coming from.
