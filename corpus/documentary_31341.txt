Eccentric social entrepreneur Sadie Kaye liberates three British persistent young offenders on an empowering white-knuckle voyage of adventure. The motley crew sail Sadie from the UK to Venezuela in hurricane conditions enduring constant alien threats. After venturing inside anarchic El Rodeo Jail and meeting their Venezuelan counterparts the crew unite with the Nobel Peace Prize-nominated gang-reform program Proyecto Alcatraz disarming teenage street gangs in Caracas slums. The 2010 film was broadcast on Sky & Discovery and described by BBC One Controller Danny Cohen as "one of the most moving powerful and entertaining documentaries I've seen."
