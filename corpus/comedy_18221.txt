More terror/magic hijinks from Penn & Teller with support from some other players. 'Paul Provenza' (qv) spends the whole show trapped in a system of giant tubes. Skits include a new director and an auditioning starlet who can and will do anything and the Three Stooges on a construction project. Other notable tricks include earthworms finding a photo from a stack a borrowed ring apparently cut from a volunteer's stomach and a bullet swap.
