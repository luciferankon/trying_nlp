After Mary Tyler Moore's long running sitcom ended she tried to venture in comedy-variety. This was one of her attempts. It follows the same formula used in such shows like Carol Burnett. There are comedy sketches and musical numbers. And also there are behind the scenes sketches wherein the cast are not at work and there is either a comedy routine and/ or musical number usually done by Mary.
