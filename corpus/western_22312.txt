Postal Inspector Gene Autry ('Gene Autry (I)' (qv))and Smiley Burnette ('Smiley Burnette' (qv))arrive in Red Bluff to investigate a series of mail robberies. Gene becomes suspicious of Big Jim Lattimer ('Thurston Hall' (qv)) uncle of Elaine Lassiter ('Gail Davis (I)' (qv)) after Smiley finds burned fragments of U.S. Postal Bonds following a bank holdup on the Lassiter ranch. A string of mail robberies bring Gene and Smiley to Red Valley an area controlled by Jim Lassiter. Gene knows Lassiter is the head of the outlaw gangs working in Red Valley but needs proof. He offers to buy some of Lassiter's land and Lassiter demands cash. Gene brings the money knowing Lassiter will try and get it but things change when two of Lassiter's henchmen knowing their cut will be small take the money for themselves and flee.
