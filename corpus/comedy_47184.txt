Dawn has been a shut-in for five years but reaches out through her cooking show Dawn's Delights. Sharon is recently deceased but still kicking (and flaking) as a zombie. Making Sharon's life more even more complicated she's apparently still a Vegan as well but now her preference is for rotten fruit and veggies. So when Sharon wins a contest to have Dawn cook her a meal on the program Dawn has to make some Vegan zombie substitutions to her regular recipes.
