In the United States Adhaobi is raised to be self reliant and doesn't question what she has been told about the death of her parents or why Aunt Judith avoids interaction with people from their birthplace. Only when she meets Peter a recently emigrated medical student does Adhaobi learn about the harsh side of their culture and how difficult it is to escape even overseas.
