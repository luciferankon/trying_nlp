We follow Lee Miles a struggling singer/songwriter working his way through both personal setbacks and health problems as he navigates through another year as an out-of-time artist who can't find his way out of the mud. Along the way we meet his friends fans and band mates hear his songs go on tour get a look at his city and learn that our hero has a personally relevant - and quite grand - new project in the works.
