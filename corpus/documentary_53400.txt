Set in the backstreets of Agra's slums GEETA takes us on the journey of an acid attack survivor who finds the courage to fight for a better life for her three daughters against almost impossible odds. Married at a young age Geeta found herself in an abusive marriage and continually harassed by her husband and in-laws for giving birth to girls. Geeta and her three daughters' lives were changed forever when in an act of brutal 'revenge' her husband egged on by his family plotted and carried out an acid attack that critically injured Geeta blinded her young daughter Neetu and killed her newborn baby girl. Ostracized by her community and disowned by friends Geeta pulled herself away from the brink of suicide and found the steel to fight for justice for herself and daughters and build a new life for all of them. From being forced - by social structures and property laws - to live with her husband again to finding a way for her daughter Neetu to have life-changing eye operations to becoming an independent and respected leader of the women of her community Geeta's story is wildly courageous always surprising and a searing reminder of the power of love to create real change.
