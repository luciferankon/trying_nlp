A film practically broken down to the basics of human life  where a face of any random human can play a part of any public judgment. A face that can predict an answer on its own but hides the real answer in utter darkness a face that can change its tides on its own and direct the flow of judgment to a point of conclusion where the real identity of a particular human stays anonymous and the same human turns to something obscure to the observer.
