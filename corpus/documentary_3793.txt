Documentary photographer 'Zana Briski' (qv) journeyed into Calcutta's underworld to photograph the city's prostitutes. In return she offered to teach the prostitutes' children the basics of photography so that the kids could document their own lives on the streets of one of the world's poorest cities. The resulting photographs often astonishing were exhibited around the world; many of them are seen in this film which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2005. Amidst the apparent growing prosperity of India there is a dark underbelly of poverty of another side of the nation that is little known. This film is a chronicle of filmmakers 'Zana Briski' (qv) and 'Ross Kauffman (I)' (qv)'s efforts to show that world of Calcutta's red light district. To do that they inspired a special group of children of the prostitutes of the area to photograph the most reluctant subjects of it. As the kids excel in their new found art the filmmakers struggle to help them have a chance for a better life away from the miserable poverty that threatens to crush their dreams.
