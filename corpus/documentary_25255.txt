Documentary about director Stephan Elliott's career after making award winning fan favourite and festival darling- Priscilla Queen Of The Desert. The film touches on Welcome To Woop Woop but mostly focuses on the making of his second follow up Eye Of The Beholder. Directed by Elliott's friend and collaborator Lizzie Gardiner you get an intimate and what feels like a very uncensored look at making a film after great success(Priscilla...) and failure( Welcome...). Gardiner who won an Oscar for costume design for Priscilla Queen Of The Desert and is perhaps more recognisable for having worn a gold American Express dress to the Awards show - manages to infuse humour and sweetness to an otherwise soul crushing process. Worth watching if only to see some of the behind the scenes antics of a director and his stars (Ashley Judd and Ewan McGregor).
