In Search of... Zombies is the third in a series of videos based on the '70s TV show hosted by Leonard Nimoy investigating supernatural and paranormal phenomena. The show was revived in 2010 by the artist Matthew Day Jackson. In Search of... Zombies was filmed in New York and across the American West from Las Vegas to the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site in South Dakota in the summer of 2011. The episode focuses on the ubiquitous contemporary figure of the zombie. Zombies are everywhere or so it seems and the program tries to figure out why as well as propose alternate or expanded ways in which we might think about them. The classic zombies are all considered but so are some less traditional models. Archival footage from a wide array of sources is mixed with contemporary travelogue as the narrator wends his way across the American West. The episode features interviews with ethnobotanist Wade Davis author of The Serpent and the Rainbow and artist Adam Helms.
