A tragedy based loosely on Shakespeare's Measure for Measure about an aging and no longer relevant Irish mob who is struggling to keep their hold on a city and the one cop who still holds a family grudge. Her efforts to bring them to justice cause her to lose everything she has and fails to stop time from marching on.
