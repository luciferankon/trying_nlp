Nazareth Michigan contains the Sisters of St. Joseph Mother House. At 237000 square feet the historic convent houses over 80 sisters and includes assisted living facilities a chapel a theater a full kitchen a cafeteria and many libraries. As the sisters age and their numbers decrease maintenance and navigation of the convent has become difficult. As a solution the sisters funded the construction of a smaller modern facility on land behind the Mother House. Though the move is necessary it marks the end of an era; many of the sisters have lived in the Mother House for most of their adult lives.
