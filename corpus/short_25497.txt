A picture is a lasting memory and a memory that can forget is a picture that can be erased. "Translucent Twilight" seeks to highlight how privileged is our Argentine territory in natural resources emphasizing its vast reserves of fresh water. Throughout photographs taken at the Nahuel Huapi National Park we try to capture a certain moment to turn it into memory to make it last somehow. But the picture is ephemeral because in it we can only capture a portion of that time. We transform light into images that we keep on paper or in a file over time but we cannot capture a specific spatiotemporality in a photograph. Memory is the phenomenon of the presence of one thing which is absent; memory is the fight against oblivion. Here we arrive at the reflective mnemonic Ranciƒçre's experience and his objetal approach according to which all consciousness is consciousness of something and oblivion is the destruction of footprints. The landscapes contain their past in the form of footprints and contain its history as the lines of a hand. In this context we must fight against oblivion and create a collective memory that contemplates the beauty and richness of our Patagonian territory and its natural resources.
