Ash has the power to communicate with ETs a gift he needs to strip himself of by the end of the day or he will succumb to its consuming side-effects. His powers are not only alienating him from people but making him one of 'them' - cold calculating and devoid of human emotion. He sets out on a mission to find a cure and to do that he must reconnect with his old life before the gift took over.
