Cuizhen is a barber. As a latecomer she was not embraced well by locals. After a serious illness over a decade ago however she became a psyche possessed by Mao Zedong. Over the years countrymen have worshipped so many people with magic power. While a lot of them claimed to represent Chairman Mao revolutionaries or founding fathers and wanted to build a heaven in the other world Cuizhen didn't agree. She just wanted to gather all those psyches and villagers and celebrate Mao's birthday once a year. The birthday preparation however didn't go well and it's turned into a psyche battlefield for power and status.
