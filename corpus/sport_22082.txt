Sky Sports Originals documentary 'Out of Contract' follow 5 footballers in their search for a club. In the summer of 2016 844 professional footballers in England were out of contract. 690 were released with many never getting another full time deal. By the time the transfer window closed at the start of September more than 200 were still without a club. The Professional Footballers' Association estimate that 75% of players entering the industry at the age of 16 will have exited by the time they reach 21. Away from the glamour and financial riches of top flight football this can be a scary prospect with the average professional career lasting for just 8 years.
