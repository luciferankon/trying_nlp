A chance meeting of two strangers. A journey film. A documentary. A diary. A first-person narrative. An essay film. An introspection. A contemplation of the documentary genre. It's static. It's moving. It's deep. It's mundane. Past. Future. Here and now. It might take you nowhere. It might take you A Long Way.
