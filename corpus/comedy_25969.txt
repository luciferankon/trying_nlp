The Power Trials Project is a superhero-themed web series and trans-media project about the difficulties of balancing a "hero" life with a human one. The series focuses on a group of heroes who work for the Hero Undertaking Bureau where the heroes give us a glimpse into the lives they lead when they are back at the office off the battlefield. At the H.U.B the heroes are divided into two branches: the Supers and the Gadgets. The rivalry between the two branches intensifies as the heroes work with (and sometimes against) each other to save the day every day.
