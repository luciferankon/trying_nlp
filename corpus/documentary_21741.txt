The Koolama pride of Western Australia's shipping fleet lay crippled in the shallows on a remote beach hundreds of miles from civilisation. Its 200 passengers and crew some with horrific injuries sought refuge in a nearby cove. Ten days earlier their voyage was brought to an abrupt end as Japanese Zeros attacked from the north and pounded Koolama's decks with bombs and machine gun fire. What followed is a story of survival and heroic achievement. It's also a tale of conflict jealously and powerful personalities. Many say it's the story of Australia's forgotten mutiny.
