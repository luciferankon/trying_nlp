Papa stars as a reporter for a large newspaper who has bigger plans to become a comedy writer and move out of Jersey. He and his wife Karen are happily married and are each other's best friend. Tom's lifelong friend Judah (Robert Patrick Benedict "Felicity") has chosen to not work and live off of his trust fund even though it only gives him $8000 a year. At the newspaper Tom's boss Blevin attempts to make the office staff like him better than Tom -- which usually backfires and leaves him with an even greater disdain for Tom. Former Los Angeles Laker and Chicago Bulls star John Salley plays the angry seven-foot-tall mailman who just grows angrier every time Tom tries to befriend him.
