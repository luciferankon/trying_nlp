A Kabukicho gigolo with a gambling debt Mikio Osawa agrees to bump off a rich wife's husband for a bundle of cash but botches the hit. On the run in the snow-covered hills of northern Japan he holes up in a shuttered deserted house. But the house is not empty: a timid traumatized girl Mika Ito lives there in the thrall of a sick hot-tempered trucker Shiro Sano who has kept her there since she was a tiny girl. Osawa tries hard but looks out of his depth here as veteran Sano and 23-year-old ing√©nue Ito build an all-too-believable monstrous relationship as sadistic paternal pervert and terrified tremulous child. File under guilty pleasure.
