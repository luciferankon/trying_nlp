What happens when a community's world turns upside down? For the residents of rural Pemiscot County 2006 brought death and devastation in the form of a tornado and a string of teenage suicides. Misery Missouri takes a penetrating look into the lives of the townspeople to see how they cope with the aftermath and hope for a better tomorrow. Located in the boot heel of Missouri Pemiscot County represents an America long forgotten. Once a thriving cotton and river community the area has been reduced to low-wage jobs derelict housing and dreams abandoned. When an F3 tornado crashed into town on April 2 2006 the townspeople thought the worst had happened. The high school was totaled. Families were displaced. Disaster was declared. Little did they know that was just the beginning. Between June and November four teenage boys would take their lives... all 18 years old. The deaths of these boys sent the tight-knit community into a tailspin. Who was next? How can we stop this? Why? No one knew. There was only one certainty. The county had to rebuild - emotionally and physically. Working without a crew filmmaker Mark Andrew Philip takes viewers on an emotional journey along the river's edge to Misery Missouri.
