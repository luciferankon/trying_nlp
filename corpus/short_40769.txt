This three-channel video installation revisits the saga of young Cuban boy Elián González who became caught up in a bitter custody battle between the U.S. and Cuba in 1999. The boy's personal and evocative story is echoing Cuba's own political history via archive footage and slogans of the Castro-led Revolution.
