Elliott's swan song as Ryder finds wildcatter Tom Dean (Jay Kirby) talking the fiery Cheyenne Jackson (Peggy Stewart) into drilling for oil on her land. Town banker Tuttle (Milton Kibbee) knows there is oil on the Jackson land and the other ranches and refuses to lend her the money for the drilling. Cheyenne sells the local ranchers on forming a combine to raise the funds needed and Dean proceeds. Tuttle after everybody's land has the drilling rig blown up and Dean framed for the act. But Red Ryder (Bill Elliott as Wild Bill Elliott) isn't having any of that and begins to unravel the Tuttle scheme.
