For years Jorgelino worked as an agent in the repression apparatus of the military government. Jorgelino was "el mocito" the one who served the cafecitos in the middle of a torture session the one who packed the already inert bodies and loaded them into the coffers of cars. Jorgelino was recently accused of the death of Víctor Díaz General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1976. This fact gives Jorgelino the opportunity to reflect on his history. The Mocito is the psychological portrait of a man destroyed by his past. A man who participated in the horror and crimes of the military dictatorship and today in becoming aware of all this desperately seeks forgiveness and redemption.
