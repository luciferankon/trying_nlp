'Life Is A Movie' is the story of avant garde filmmaker and photographer Larry Moyer. In 1963 Greenwich Village Moyer created the award winning beatnik film 'The Moving Finger.' In 1967 he and pal Shel Silverstein were sent by Playboy magazine to cover the Summer of Love in Haight-Ashbury. Shortly thereafter they took up residence in the legendary houseboat community of Sausalito where Larry spent the next 50 years turning on tuning in and dropping out happily finding a life that many have searched for and few have ever found.
