In 1967 Michael Snow presented an artistic short film called "Wavelength" revolving around a practically static shot of a room where the sound of waves and Beatles come crashing in order to create a full other art image. Snow decided to excise some of its minutes and turn into a more comprehensive view of his art project several years later which could be considered as a director's cut. This is "Wavelength For Those Who Don't Have The Time".
