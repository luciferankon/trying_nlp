Three friends have two things in common: (1) they like to bet on the horses at the track and (2) they invariably lose. One day they hit upon a scheme to steal one of the track's betting machines so that they'd be able to print winning tickets and recoup the money they've lost over the years. However things don't go exactly as planned.
