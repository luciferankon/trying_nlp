In the 1960s Morup Namgyal sparked a cultural movement that would bring about profound change in his homeland of Ladakh. It was a movement built on education tradition and preservation. What Morup could not imagine at that time was that he would ultimately embrace modernization. Through the intimate interactions of three generations of the Namgyal family The Song Collector explores the uneasy relationship between culture and development and ultimately offers a new vision inspired by the Buddhist concept of the 'middle path' that seeks to find a lasting coexistence between tradition and modernization.
