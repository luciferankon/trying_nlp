Even if it is one of the largest and most frightening predators of South America the Orinoco crocodile is threatened with extinction due to hunting and the degradation of its natural habitat. There are probably not more than 2000 specimens left. In Venezuela despite economic and political difficulties enthusiastic people are fighting for the survival of this fascinating and little-known animal. They set up a farm where they raise babies until they are strong enough to be released into the wild where they can reach 6 meters long.
