A drug supply company plans to go out of business which could force Peavey the druggist to close up shop. Throckmorton Gildersleeve heads to New York City to help and gets a warm reception from the company's president a lonely widow. Based on "The Great Gildersleeve" radio series. Perennial bachelor Gildersleeve (of radio fame) finally gets engaged to Mildred then must leave for New York ostensibly on a mission for druggist friend Peavey but really to locate his niece Margie's erring beau Jimmy. Soon he's dodging three women: a golddigging blonde his fianc√©e and nutty Laura Chandler the drug supplier Peavey needs to win over; slapstick is the order of the day.
