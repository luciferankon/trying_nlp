CONTEXT Pripyat (Ukraine) is a city built near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant for the employees and their families. Named as the 'city of children' Pripyat was a model of the Soviet city full of life and with a promising future which was interrupted by the explosion at the nuclear power plant on April 26 1986. After the accident which was recognized as the largest nuclear accident in the history so called temporary evacuation was carried out. It prolongs until today. There are many documents about Chernobyl and its human and environmental disaster. However none of the audiovisual projects bring us closer to the city which survived the catastrophe and does not show how its residents went through it. It is important to show what was there to understand the drama that the evacuees came through. Eventually people found themselves expelled and forgotten by the Soviet Union and were left on their own in the country that shortly after the incident went bankrupt. 'Memories from Chernobyl' is a documentary project which will recreate the city of Pripyat before the accident. Through the testimonies of different characters we will know what was the city which represented the pride of the Soviet Union in its world struggle for power in the field of nuclear energy. The main characters are fireman policeman two employees of nuclear power plants and a nurse. These people who were living in Pripyat tell us about what they were doing on April 26 1986 the day when the accident in the 4th reactor occurred and how they left their homes and their past life. These people have met to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the accident at the abandoned streets of their city and share their memories.
