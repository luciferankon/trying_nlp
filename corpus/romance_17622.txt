There's nothing necessarily wrong with being a daddy's girl. It means that you love your father and your father adores and possibly spoils you to show his love. But for Eun Chae Ryung (Moon Chae Won) more so than her older sister Ae Ryung (Lee Hee Jin) and younger brother Ho Ryung (Kang Won) being a daddy's girl means she's not only spoiled but also that she relies a little too much on her father Eun Ki Hwan (Lee Jeong Kil) to take care of everything in her life.
