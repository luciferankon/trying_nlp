Numerous acting singing and dancing performances are captured both in auditions and at TRIPLE SENSATION'S Master Class an exclusive and intensive training ground for Canada's best emerging entertainers. Through interviews and video diaries we will get inside the heads of the performers and hear about the preparation and pressure of auditioning and what it's like to audition for and train with a heady group of theater icons. We will experience the profoundly dramatic and emotional world of the performers as they are pushed to their limits. We will also hear from the voice of experience as the audition panelists and Master Class instructors dissect performances and inspire the performers to dig deeper to become even better artists.
