'Clean Paonta green Paonta' is an initiative to keep this small industrial town pollution free. Started by a senior citizen Mr. Rajendra Tewari the idea was to inject this thought in young minds. The uniqueness of this mission cleanup is that young children have taken the cause in their own hands. The town Paonta is situated at the banks on Yamuna River and it becomes all the more important to take care of the pollution of all kinds. Core group that included SDM H.S. Rana and Mr. Tewari himself started to speak in schools. Soon the initiative became a mission and school children were motivated to monitor the waste management at their home. Today around 35000 children are part of it and they operate in groups and every group has a name. As an inititiative they visit shops and business establishments to inspect inquire and motivate the respective shopkeepers to handle their waste carefully. They keep a record and also sees the cleanliness around the shops give there feedback and submit it to the group. This whole program has a remarkable impact on the society. Their effort is bearing fruit and this door to door cleanliness drive is making the city cleaner and healthier. 'Clean Paonta green Paonta' no longer stayed a slogan. It has made inroads into the conscience of people at the grass root level. The holy city of Paonta sahib deserved this campaign because as they say 'the love for God is the love to protect the environment'. Cleanliness is a spiritual experience as well.
