A group of people -students an elderly couple a violinist searching for her husband (taken by the KGB) anxious parents a priest and others- find themselves in the same place on the evening of January 12 1991. They are defending their newly-established freedom against the Soviet occupiers. They position themselves at the Television Tower where the Soviet troops are trying to take control of communications (under the orders of Mikhail Gorbachev). The protesters are unarmed. New friendships are formed. But soon the tanks and troops advance and threaten the singing protesters.
