Excellent and beautifully edited first-person account of Keith's early life family and influences interspersed with family photographs and illustrative and relevant film footage of the time. And of course with music including musical influences music of the time and fragments of Stones songs thematically linked to Keith's words. What shines through is Keith's down-to-earthness and gentle but irreverent humour.
