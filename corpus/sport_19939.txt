Everybody is busy with the preparations for the event of the year the largest soccer game of all time. The favoured team of the "Wild Dogs " assumed the challenge of equally favoured "Lionkings". The coach of the "Wild Dogs " spends sleepless nights. Does Bulli his left defender never learns not to beat up his opponent- or Butcher the-Keeper never loose his fear of a penalty kick? Also in the opposing team there are problems. The best forward of the "Lionkings" the small lion never wants to pass the ball. And to make things even worse a swarm of Hooligeese is reported to be on the way.... Finally the time has come. The match is about to begin.
