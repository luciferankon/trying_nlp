She's a Boy I Knew is a comic heartbreaking uplifting autobiography that focuses on the interpersonal relationships of a family who unexpectedly find their bonds strengthening as they overcome their preconceptions of gender and sexuality. Filmmaker Gwen Haworth turns her camera on her family for this down-to-earth grassroots documentary that follows her transition from male to female over the course of several years. This thoughtful film is less a detailing of surgeries and more a meditation on family ties
