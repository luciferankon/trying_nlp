A documentary about three young people each a member of a fringe religious community who have separated themselves from mainstream America in order to live immersed in their faiths. Set against depressed but quintessentially American landscapes - the former revivalist district of upstate New York old mining country in the mountains of northern California and the stark badlands of South Dakota - the film interlaces three very intimate apolitical portraits of young individuals trying to lead more extraordinary mystical lives.
