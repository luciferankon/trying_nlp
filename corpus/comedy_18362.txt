Dis-Life is a Comedy based around Disability. We follow Jake's life (a wheelchair user) as he hits upon hard financial times after spending a large amount of his compensation money (he received because of a mistake at the hospital when he was born) on living the high life. He rents a room out in his swanky north london flat to ALEX a friend of his brother. Alex is a simple soul (some would say stupid) and we often find him putting his foot in it.
