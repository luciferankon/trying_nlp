A filmmaker who found his home in a novel tries against hope to retrieve this world in reality. The result is a dialogue in images and words between the writer and filmmaker about dreaming in vain and the urgency to compulsively persist in creating art for consolation and evocation. About the small precious moment that changes our perspective. And thus all there is. With excerpts of the famous novel Chapel Road by Louis Paul Boon.
