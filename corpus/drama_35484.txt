'Emma Goldman (I)' (qv) has just arrived in New York City to join a small group of anarchists. She is excited to meet Johann Most a left wing newspaper publisher who is renowned within the movement. His primary mantra is espousing the eight hour work day. But as Emma becomes more involved with Most in both a personal sense and for the cause it brings up the idealistic struggles within the movement between someone like Most who has the ear of the public and Sasha Berkman a younger anarchist who has his own thoughts about how best to forward the cause. Berkman with who Emma would begin a personal relationship believes that assassinating steel magnate Henry Clay Frick - who many see as the puppet for industrialist Andrew Carnegie - over the Homestead Steel strike would send an important message one that Most believe foolish. From this struggle would emerge Emma's own voice within the cause.
