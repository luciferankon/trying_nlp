A biker gang who call themselves the 'Living Dead" enter into an agreement with the Devil to gain eternal life after commiting suicide but things don't turn out as expected. The first in a series that takes a "classic" flick and gives it a kick! The original film shot in 1971 is reborn with an urban flair via voiceover talent.
