An old man is living in a village. His son lives in city and from there sends him money regularly. To receive money by money order the post man holds this guys' thumb affixes on a rubber stamp and then puts in the receiver's column. So he is an Angoota Chaap much like many others in his village. Things turn one day when this old man is not available at home when the post man goes to his house. Then post man goes about his duties hoping to catch the old man some time later. However the post man happens to see the old man somewhere and while handing him over the money asks for his Thumb's impression in presence of school going children. The kids laugh at old man and make fun of him calling 'Angoota Chaap'. Now the old man decides that he will learn how to write his own name by the time the postman comes in next month. So his struggle begins as he wants to do this is in absolute secrecy as he wants to surprise everyone not only in his family but also his village with help of his grandson.
