They stood up to fight for freedoms they themselves barely had stood up to be counted as men in a country that called them 'boys.' They fought and died but their stories go largely untold. CIVIL WARRIORS tells the true story of 26 African-American men from one county in upstate New York who enlisted in the US Colored Troops and fought in the Civil War. Their compelling story unfolds through a unique interweaving of historical images and the rhythm and energy of contemporary spoken word performances. CIVIL WARRIORS is a timely film that connects us to our shared history and its inescapable impact today.
