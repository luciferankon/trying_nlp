Montreal is an island where the indie scene is blossoming like nowhere else in the world. And in the true spirit of the music Timothy George Kelly's brand new DIY film takes us to pop-up shows on rooftops in subways at playgrounds and in parking lots. In a Montreal where linguistic identity is a permanent fundamental issue a community of talented English-speaking musicians has put down roots attracted by the city's cheap rents. This scene has grown into a cultural world unto itself. Warehouses abandoned in the 1990s now buzz with these autonomous but busy new arrivals who contribute to Quebec's cultural life even though they remain perpetually on its fringes. Timothy George Kelly's film is an uncompromising exploration of an independent music scene unintegrated with the culture surrounding it. Made with the same DIY ethos that its subjects apply to their music A City is an Island traces the struggle for expression and the place of the artist amid the contradictions of contemporary society.
