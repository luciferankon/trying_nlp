The Green Musketeers is about a group of young people in Lithuania who started a hiking club "Atgaja" in the mid eighties. They exited the reality formed by the Soviet society into the realm of nature history and national heritage and formed personal bonds that in turn provided a formidable informal infrastructure for any type of action. The club rapidly evolved into a vanguard for a national revival movement.
