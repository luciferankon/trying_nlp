The series follows Ben (Michael James Dean) a young man looking for love on a dating website after a series of disappointing relationships. Things take an unexpected turn when help flutters into his life in the form of Cupid (Darren Ruston) who offers to help Ben find that special someone. No longer innocent and cherubic this Cupid is sarcastic hostile and disheartened but he recognises something in Ben that he hesitantly welcomes and they embark on a weird and whimsical journey. Unceremoniously replaced as the harbinger of love the mysterious Cupid is self-admittedly rusty and unpractised and Ben's initial series of dates are disastrous and hopeless. Yet these are on hindsight a part of the wise and wily Cupid's plans and when Ben is about to quit in comes the beautiful warm and surprising Lucy (Lauren Wigmore). As Ben has always done he readily confides his thoughts and feelings to his best friend and girl next door; the insightful sensitive and funny Kayleigh (Shelley Davenport) and just as things are looking to improve in his love life Ben realises his feelings for Kayleigh might be more than just platonic.
