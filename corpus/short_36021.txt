This is my tribute to my hometown Bournemouth. This film depicts many of the places I frequented growing up during the 1960's and 1970's in the area. The soundtrack reflects the time I saw the Beatles perform at the Gaumont Cinema and later found my first job in Richmond Chambers once home of Sir Hubert Parry composer of Jerusalem. You will see that Bournemouth is changing and I hope you will appreciate this nostalgic 10 minute film clip. Produced edited and directed by Barry Levinson.
