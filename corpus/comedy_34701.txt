Two delinquent twenty-something underachievers Jag Gupta and Roddy Burns reflect on their pathetic lives and shortcomings with the approach of the Indian celebration of Diwali. The two find themselves in the predicament of proving they are responsible adults to Jag's irritable and oppressive father. In order to gain respect Roddy lies to Mr. Gupta about having a friendship with Toronto Devils all-star pro shortstop Dexter Wiggins. A bet ensues where if Jag and Roddy can have Dexter appear at the insane Gupta family Diwali dinner Mr. Gupta will pay for any place that Jag and Roddy want to live in. If they can't produce him Jag and Roddy will be deemed eternal losers and Jag will be kicked out of the house. With little options left the two go about hilarious criminal acts to obtain Dexter and convince the cantankerous star athlete to do this huge favor.
