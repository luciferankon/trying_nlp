For eight-year-old Henna life has become difficult since her mothers illness causing her father to divorce. When her Bedouin relative arrives into the burgeoning fishing town he brings back nostalgic memories amongst the local fishermen and new fascinations for the children. But when two teenagers steal his precious camels the party is soon over. The Bedouin spends the night pacing through the dark alleys looking for his camels and disappointed by daybreak travels back into the desert. Fortunately a recent school trip leaves Henna with a new fascination: the magical world inside the recently built shopping mall.
