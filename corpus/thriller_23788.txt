He manages to crawl into the open and with no sign of life he staggers to a warehouse hidden amongst the trees with only one thing left on his mind...vengeance on all those who betrayed him. Leaving a devastating trail of death and chaos Jack soon uncovers a twisted conspiracy where no one is innocent. "To get revenge...he must first begin at the end"
