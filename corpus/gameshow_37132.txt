Five is giving undiscovered artists the chance to show they're the next Damien Hirst or John Constable in a nationwide competition Big Art Challenge which carries a prize of ≈Å10000 for the lucky winner.

This third programme is filmed in the Lowry Gallery a relatively young gallery which is set in a magnificent waterside location at the heart of the redeveloped Salford Quays in Greater Manchester.
