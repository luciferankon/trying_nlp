We start at Wilfried's home. He is a paragnost who tells us his tale how he became involved with the paranormal. He also tells us that he is willing to help Amber and that this documentary will be his story. Amber has summoned a evil spirit in a abandoned building which has been haunting her ever since. There is only one opportunity to get rid of this evil spirit and that is go back where it all started.
