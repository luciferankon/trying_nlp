Pupils loiter as spectators because among the ruins of a once passable educational institution a duel is taking place. Two teachers now combatants mortal foes see out the end of an era with a game of tag. Buffed up PE teacher Lee has a cohort of teenagers to help him outwit nerdy science teacher Sarah.
