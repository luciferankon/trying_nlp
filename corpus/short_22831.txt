11-year-old Alonso is in trouble at school. Big trouble. He has committed a heinous act of vandalism during recess. The incident is so serious that the young lad is pulled out of class by the counselor and taken to the Director's office to wait until his mother can be contacted to come to the school and pick the boy up. Everyone knows about the crime and has words of shame to throw at Alonso even the secretary in the Director's office. Once his mother arrives she and Alonso are ushered in to see the Director who explains the situation and the possible punishment to be meted out: the boy will be expelled from classes for one week and the family will have to pay to have the damage to the school repaired. Mom is somewhat taken aback by the severity of the 'justice' imposed by the Director but consents to it without complaint. But when offered the chance to view the terrible destruction she readily accepts. The horrible crime --and Mom's reaction-- are totally unexpected. . .
