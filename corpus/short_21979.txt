In 1943 a convoy of 120 left Treblinka and moved to the Northeastern part of Italy. They had completed Aktion Reinhardt and were ready to engage in anti-partisan combat in Trieste and Istria. Buried under the overwhelming evidence of the Holocaust this is the story of a very little known concentration camp specialized in the killing of freedom fighters. The concentration camp's site today is a museum but its history is still hidden away in archives.
