In 1929 the Great Depression hit Newfoundland with as much force as did the Burin tsunami. Teetering on bankruptcy Newfoundland sought refuge back under British control--the only Dominion in history to return to the status of a colony. Then the Second World War hit bringing its own disasters right to Newfoundland's shores. In this episode follow the dramatic stories of the German U-Boat that stalked the passenger ferry SS Caribou and the phenomenal rescue of hundreds of sailors from the wrecks of the U.S. naval ships Truxton and Pollux. With Newfoundland a hub of Allied activity the war also revived Newfoundland's fortunes. A few years later islanders sought a new political future in a hotly contested referendum. Then the resettlement program emptied the coasts of hundreds of communities. More recently the government set a moratorium on fishing cod. In the years from 1929 on one massive wave after another has rocked the island and Newfoundland has been transformed.
