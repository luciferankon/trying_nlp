Sénéchal an actor touring the provinces with the "Tournées Carlini" does not meet the success he thinks he deserves. One night in Dreux he finds himself without his luggage and dressed up as a Foreign Legion officer he is invited to a party thrown by a colonel. He creates a sensation there and does not leave the colonel's wife ... indifferent! Back in Paris Sénéchal goes through a similar experience. This time around wearing tuxedo and top hat he gets mistaken for a diplomat and charms the guests of a wedding party. Arrested by the police he chooses to do without an attorney at his trial and his brilliant eloquence has him acquitted. A question remains unanswered though : will all those people who give an ovation in real life ever go to see him on stage ?
