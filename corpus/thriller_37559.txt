Swiss police investigator Christine Sutter's daily battle with corrupt chauvinistic colleagues and her emotionally unstable husband is compounded when her current murder investigation ties into a mysterious mass suicide in the Jura Mountains. The trail of clues leads her to an ancient parchment that exposes a religious cover-up of epic proportions with the power to change the course of the modern world. The film Twelve Theses is freely based on the thrilling novel 'Cruor' by Herbert Blaser. The action largely set in Basel and Bern Switzerland expands to Italy and Spain in its search for a truth that began 2000 years ago in Palestine.
