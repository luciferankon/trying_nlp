Axel: Bloody Genius is a documentary about a journey of underground cult legend Axel An artist that is known for painting in his own blood and making extreme  but beautifully crafted jewelry. It is a retrospect of his long career hiatus and creative resurrection. During the making of this movie the staff of Art on A gallery followed the artist in his everyday surroundings preparing for his first art show in thirty years. It took director Grace Perez a year and a half to capture the essence of Axel: Bloody Genius. To make the movie more dynamic Grace asked Axel's good friend Peter Greene to narrate the story. Peter Greene is a well known Hollywood actor that was prominently featured in Pulp Fiction The Usual Suspects and The Mask along with dozens of other movies.
