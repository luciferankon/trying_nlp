Jason Love tackles the problem of being metrosexual in a macho-man world. He also plays music and shares his quirky one-liner observations. Turnout for this concert was so great that while his opening act warmed up the audience Jason did an impromptu show for the 150 "overflow people" at a nearby wine bar.
