An unidentified person goes about stealing babies from the wombs of pregnant mothers who were about to deliver. In another setting an Agent of the Special Task Force had taken a break from his job and was ministering his wife who was recuperating from a self-inflicted bullet injury. The maverick Task Force Officer is recalled to service to nab the womb-raider. He captures the perpetrator and throws him in prison. But the womb-raidings continue and more pregnant women lose their lives and babies. The Task Force Officer knew in his heart that the perpetrator in the prison cell was doing it but how was he going to prove it.
