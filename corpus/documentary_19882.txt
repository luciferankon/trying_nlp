Topless Shock Syndrome is a compelling documentary that follows controversial artist Holly Van Voast into New York's alternative "punk drag" community. Along the way the audience meets women of the Top Free movement and the ground breaking court ruling that unites them. This is a journey through the thorny issues of civil rights gender equality and a society struggling with conflicting concepts of morality. Sometimes amusing--and sometimes disturbing--the film captures the world as told by Holly and the women of the top free movement.
