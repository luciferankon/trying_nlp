Blacksmith Pinto Peters (Raymond Hatton) calls on his old friend Sam "Hurricane" Benton (Johnny Mack Brown) to help him clear his son Jimmy (Riley Hill) of a murder charge. Hot-headed Jimmy believes that the best way to cure a man of cheating at cards is to shoot him. He didn't shoot him enough as the gambler only feigns death as part of a plot to gain possession of land owned by Pinto as they know there is gold on the land buried there by an outlaw gang years ago.
