An exact reproduction of the work of the Red Cross Society during an engagement. These brave men are rushing around on the battlefield with stretchers picking up the wounded and hurrying them off to a place of safety. Officers on horseback are giving orders for the handling of the unfortunates. A wounded officer falls from his horse and is picked up and placed on a stretcher and carried off the horse following behind with bowed head. A very pathetic scene.
