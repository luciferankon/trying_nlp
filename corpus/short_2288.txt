In a caf√© Sam sits looking at the menu. He has trouble deciding what to order. A blond woman his age enters and sits a few tables away. Sam imagines several attempts at conversation with her; each of his ice breakers is inept. Around him we hear the conversations at other tables most of them odd even bizarre. Occasionally Sam's eyes meet those of the blond. Will they connect? Maybe she'll walk to his table and engage him. Can either screw their courage to the sticking point?
