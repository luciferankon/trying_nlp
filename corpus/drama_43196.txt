Frank Keenan president of the Stillwater Railroad demands that Hugh Tomlinson an engineer who has been on duty for eighteen hours make another run. Tomlinson falls asleep at the throttle and a collision results. The engineer is discharged and dissension spreads among his co-workers. J. Montgomery Nixon the scheming president of the Central Railroad tries to ruin the Stillwater system but is foiled by Simeon Tetlow of the latter company. Unknown to Tomlinson he is given aid by Tetlow but the engineer continues to work against him. The differences between the two men are straightened out by the engineer's little grand-daughter and after the grievances of the workmen of the Stillwater company have been settled Tomlinson is appointed to run Tetlow's special train.
