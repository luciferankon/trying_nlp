A solitary man who lives in a one-room flat with a high window he must float up to in order to observe the world below sees a woman walking her goldfish Pez. He runs down to the street and invites her to dinner. She joins him but says nothing eats her meat with her hands which delights him and ignores him when he floats and dances for her. Will anything bring emotion to her vacant gaze?
