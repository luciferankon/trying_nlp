The film is a drama about three four memories in one night that three four (the fourth is physically absent but no less present at the same time) spend together with no obligations free of all bonds as the night before they finished all relationships. The story in the film is happening from the morning where/when the film starts until the night of the previous day where/when the film ends. Everything that happens in the film is about what happened before that before the beginning (end) of the film when we the spectators entered the story just like we were a substitution for the Fourth after his disappearance. The film is a story about remembering three views in the same night that are trying to review its variety. The film turns the memories into dreams and reflects the surrealism of our own memories and realities.
