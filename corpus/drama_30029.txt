Willy Waltz is the proud director of Circus Waltz. His will is stronger than his health which seriously fails him. However he doesn't want to see a doctor because he hasn't got the time: After all the circus must go on. When the council of a very religious town asks him to cancel an already planned show because of the Sunday rest he bluntly refuses and decides to have a chat with the local vicar. While promoting the Sunday show he passes out once again and one of his three sons takes him to a hospital.
