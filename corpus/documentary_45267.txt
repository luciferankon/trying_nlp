The story of the SOE "finishing school" on the Beaulieu estate. During World War II the Special Operations Executive (SOE) was created by 'Winston Churchill (I)' (qv) and was tasked to "Set Europe Ablaze". They trained secret agents and sent them behind enemy lines in Europe and around the world. After being trained in physical fitness self-defence unarmed combat and other survival skills sabotage and the use of weapons and explosives as well as radio communications the agents were sent to Beaulieu which acted as a finishing school. There they were subject to psychological evaluation and taught the finer points of surviving behind enemy lines. This documentary tells the story of some of the agents who passed through Churchill's Spy School and along with contemporary footage of their training talks to some of the surviving agents and those who trained them.
