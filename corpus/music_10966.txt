When Mr. B was playing in front of his first large audience and met Bob Seeley for the first time many years ago little did he know that the two would become close friends and two of the better known international purveyors of boogie-woogie piano alive today. Mr. B influenced by a number boogie-woogie piano greats including Little Brother Montgomery and Bob Seeley a classical pianist by training and protégé of the late great Meade Lux Lewis deliver grace style lightning and thunder. Here the two play blues and jazz standards back-to-back in two different styles. Directed by Greg Olliver (Lemmy) this DVD of their live show was motivated by their original studio recording in 2007 which first captured this concept.
