This program whisks you off dry land and takes you on an historic voyage aboard Maluka; a 1932-built yacht restored for the 2006 Sydney Hobart Yacht Race. ABC2 follows this journey of rebirth and adventure in Maluka. Sean Langman switched from speed to nostalgia by restoring the 9 metre Ranger. What makes Maluka's restoration unusual is that Sean decided to take it one step further. Rather than going for a museum restoration Sean took Maluka to a standard that enabled her to compete in the recent Sydney Hobart Yacht Race. The Sydney Hobart Yacht Race began in 1945 when a group of yachting enthusiasts in tiny boats embarked on a voyage across Bass Strait. It soon became one of the most competitive yacht races in the world. Now dominated by the maxi yachts Sean Langman embraced the original spirit of the race by tackling the treacherous route in the smallest and oldest boat in the 2006 fleet. Maluka's attempt at the race was history making as it was the 70th anniversary of her first trip to Hobart which she successfully completed nine years before the first race was run. In this extraordinary ABC2 special discover how this 'little boat' went from a skeleton to a Sydney Hobart Yacht Race competitor in a matter of months.
