Barry Robin and Maurice Gibb arrived in England in the 60s shipped from Australia with only one thought - success. The brothers were certainly not disappointed as their substantial rise happened rapidly guided by future iconic movie producer Robert Stigwood who was partner of the Beatles Brain Epstein. These young brothers toiled with success from extraordinary musical creations but young egos huge money and overwhelming fame from the 70s and world hits like Saturday Night Fever took a toll on the brothers. Barry and Robin although able to make music magic in the studio struggled to see eye to eye damaging their relationship behind the camera and while Maurice was a bridge between the two he fell into his own spiral of self-destruction with alcohol.
