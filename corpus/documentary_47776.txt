The validity of the Bible has been debated and fought over for centuries. Stolen and adapted by other religions it has spawned hundreds of sects and cults. Experts say much of what we read in today's version is riddled with deception and diversion however there are also sacred and ancient secrets hidden within. The truth about the marriage of Jesus Christ to Mary Magdalene and their children; the real name of Jesus Christ and his unusual origins; the total destruction of the Tower of Babel by a strange alien race called the Anunnaki; Sodom and Gommorah being destroyed by a nuclear explosion; and even the hidden mathematical code that holds within it divine revelation about future events. Explore and investigate the latest theories and research and discover the real secrets of the Bible. A pseudo intellectual drones on and on trying to convince himself and others that there is no validity to the Bible. Cherry picked verses with no context mishmashed together with Google searched synopses of world mythology astrology astronomy and he even mentions geology once or twice in a sophomoric attempt to discredit Faith. I was reminded of a poorly paid professor at a no name college attempting to convince someone he has something intelligent to convey. The truly pathetic thing about "intellectuals" of this ilk is they have no clue about the nature of Faith or the nature of God.
