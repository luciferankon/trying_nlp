Told through the eyes of a patriot farmer this film exposes the politicians and corporate interest groups responsible for attempting to carry out one of the most illegal and unconstitutional laws this country has ever seen. Footage and interviews will show how Michigan's Department of Natural Resources politicians and Michigan Pork producers teamed up to create propaganda which has effectively wiped out all organic-family-owned pig farms in Michigan. Their excuse is that they are saving jobs and saving resources.
