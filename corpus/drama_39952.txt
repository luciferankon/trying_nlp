In 2005 Farzad Ali broke a record: he single-handedly stole over 200 million pounds from British banks. The 28 year old who worked in his dad's fish and chip shop did it armed with a couple of pay-as-you-go mobile phones and a good ear for accents. When Police arrested him in a run-down internet caf√© in Glasgow he told them he'd heard 'voices' and that a man called Schofield had ordered him to steal. Farzad managed to dodge jail and was sent instead to a secure psychiatric unit for assessment. But was he really mad? And what on earth had he done with all the money?
