The show was a teen dance and music show and ran from 1957 to until 1964. Hosted by Buddy Deane who was among the first to play rock'n'roll on radio. It went to air six days a week and featured a regular rotation of dancers known as the Committee as well as lip-synced performances by artists like Bobby Darin and Connie Francis. The show included teens to dance on the show. In 1964 the show was canceled when there were protests and bomb threats as WJZ decided not to have black and white teenagers dancing together on television.
