THE eSPORTS CHALLENGE: Created and Written By: Humberto Arechiga and Travis Cochran June 22 2017 The eSports Challenge is a competitive reality television series featuring pro gamer AnarchyUprizing facing off against the most elite athletes from other professional sports (e.g. the NFL NBA MLB NHL MLS F1 and more) in a stylized series of 1v1 matchups between both competitors' respective sports - i.e. gaming for AnarchyUprizing and whatever sport that featured athlete of that episode plays in. Tensions and egos will rise as AnarchyUprizing will presumably crush any professional athlete who steps before him for gaming but the same treatment will be equally provided when AnarchyUprizing steps foot onto the court or turf of that athlete's sport leading to drama frustration elation and comedy as the head-to-head battle ensues between the two newly minted rivals.
