When wannabe L.A. filmmakers Jaye and Jason are accidentally hired to produce a travel show about Canada they seize the opportunity and divert the money to make their dream project: a sci-fi epic entitled "Invasion Q." Along the way they meet a young Canadian actress named Jos√©e who falls for their Hollywood image and believes that this will be her big break. "Low Budget" documents the J's extraordinary journey across Canada showing how stupidity can triumph over common sense every step of the way. Never has the world of independent films been portrayed with such honesty artistic license and contradiction.
