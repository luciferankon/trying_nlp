In this melodically rich bel canto masterpiece a femme fatale renowned for her ruthless pursuit of power reveals poignant vulnerability when she comes face to face with her long-lost son. Soprano Ren√©e Fleming "uncorks the secret inner torments of history's most notorious poisoner. Her best singing was sumptuous and long-lined airy and ravishingly rich" (San Jose Mercury News). Tenor Michael Fabiano "made a dashing Company debut as Gennaro breathing vivid life into the role...singing with both graceful lyricism and full-throated ardor" (San Francisco Chronicle). Mezzo-soprano Elizabeth DeShong "sings like a vocal giant. Her lowest notes have body and depth the midrange is especially rich and she propels her secure full and rounded highs with aplomb" (San Francisco Classical Voice). Bass-baritone Vitalij Kowaljow "gave a thrillingly robust and commanding account" of Duke Alfonso (San Francisco Chronicle). "The production's execution is first-rate: fine singing towering sets and outlandishly appealing costumes as well as a robust chorus and a dazzlingly spot-on performance by the orchestra conducted by Riccardo Frizza a bel canto specialist in his company debut" (San Jose Mercury News).
