A weekly tour of homes for sale in Baltimore Real Estate Open House was the first show if its kind on the East Coast. Taking real estate to TV was a novel idea in 1986 and Real Estate Open House paved the way for a complete shift in news and information regarding home sales by giving the consumer the ability to"tour" homes via video. The show was then expanded to four versions - Washington (WDCA) Southern Virginia (station unknown) and Long Island New York (News 8 Long Island). It was the first of its kind east of the Mississippi and thus should be included in the database for historical reference.
