An ambitious young grad student finds herself in charge of a tiny TV station producing local programming and must whip the station into shape if she is going to impress the bigger studios enough to transfer up. Milwaukee Basic is a TV station in the far suburbs of Milwaukee; they produce two and a half hours of local TV content on the most shoestring of budgets. One camera two man crew three shows. The lowest rated two hours of broadcast in the mid-west. Sandra does her best to get things turned around so she can promote upwards but finds that she has all she needs with her new friends.
