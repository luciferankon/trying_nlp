Two of the female characters from Jerusalem appear in a new location: a black and white minimalist apartment. With the aid of drawings to illustrate their psychological probing the ladies perform basic physical repetitions and frozen poses while being captured on video and re-lensed through low-fi cyan solariziations. Layered stereo monologues speak of their continuing personal explorations into the science-fiction dream-symbol terrain of their private histories.
