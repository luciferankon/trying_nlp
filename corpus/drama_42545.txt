Tetsuro is living with his young girlfriend Aki in a pleasant house in Tokyo. They both spend a lot of time at their jobs. However their routine is upset when Tetsuro brings his 8 year old son Shun to live with them while his ex-wife recovers from a car accident. Aki is annoyed because she was not asked and she knows that she will have to do the bulk of the work in caring for him. This forces Aki to reevaluate her relationship and decide whether she is to remain a modern working woman or become a mother.
