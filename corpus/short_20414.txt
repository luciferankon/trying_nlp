A commentary on the destructive expectations of females in a male dominated society Marilyn Times Five was made from an old stag film called "The Apple-Knockers and the Coke"(1948) these sections of the film were set to Marilyn Monroe's song "I'm Through With Love". The film depicts a Marilyn Monroe look-a-like slowly taking her clothes off for the camera (the viewer). The woman's actions are looped several times which gives the audience a sensation of exhaustion. That exhaustion keeps building until the very end where the woman is shown crumpled on the floor in an awkward position which makes it appear as if she is lifeless.
