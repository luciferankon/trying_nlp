Ruhi Singh is a small town girl with big city dreams. She sets off to Bombay to win the title of Miss India--a launching pad to fame and a surefire way to stand out in a country of 1.2 billion people. Just hours from the Miss India beauty boot camp is another training ground for girls--that of the Durga Vahini a Hindu nationalist group exclusively for women. Here we meet Prachi Trivedi a young fearsome drill sergeant training Indian girls to fight against Western culture Islam and Christianity by any means necessary including violence. Gliding back and forth between the action of the two camps the dreams and conflicts of India and young Indian women are laid bare-- the two opposing worlds aren't as far away from each other as they seem.
