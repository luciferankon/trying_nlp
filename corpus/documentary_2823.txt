A visually poetic documentary essay on the mystique of American road racing set against the backdrop of Connecticut's beloved Berkshire racecourse. The story unfolds of the track's history amidst the four seasons lovingly told with expert help of former racers Sam Posey John Fitch Skip Barber and Lemans racer Butch Leitzinger--as well as famed actor/racer Paul Newman. From the moment of a driving snowstorm that serves as the opening the film is a sensitive history lesson-- and racing experience that closes with a haunting reminder of the value of true passion.
