The term anicca expresses the Buddhist notion that all of conditioned existence without exception is in a constant state of impermanence. The ever-present duality of human nature gives birth to extremes in the way of modern living. Humanity is dreaming suffocating in illusions and lies presented by the media and social conditioning. Anicca Sanpaku is a perspective of awakening which contrasts the loss of humanity with the obsessive quest for consciousness.
