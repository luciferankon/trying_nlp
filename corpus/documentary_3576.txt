With summer temperatures in excess of 50.c - and surrounded by 12000 square kilometres of bare white alkaline mud - Bom's mother Venus has to establish a territory bring up her cubs and endure the extremes of a relentless vicious winter to a hot generous summer. Shy solitary and almost completely nocturnal the hyenas are perfectly adapted to this harsh environment. Our researcher has also adapted to this inhospitable environment using a four wheel drive quad bike fitted with a steel cage which saves Glyn's life when he is ambushed by lions during his night drives. He searches around the salt plains keeping up with the remarkable wildlife of this unique ecosystem.
