The ultimate quiz show Grand Slam pitted the former winners of the main TV quizzes (Mastermind Fifteen-to-One Countdown etc.) against one another face to face. Grand Slam was the toughest quiz on television testing all aspects of mental agility and requiring contestants to put their money where their mouths are - each contestant paid one grand in order to take part - and the winner took all.
