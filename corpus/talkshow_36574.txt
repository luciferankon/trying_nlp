Team MTM invaded Wizard World Philly and had the pleasure to see the latest and greatest in the comic book industry: Brimstone and the Borderhounds from Hound Comics. Check out MTM's Aaron808 interviewing Brimstone meeting new Hound artist Mina Sanwald throwing up a meatball to Marcello Carnevali and the lyrical skills of Luscious "Bacock!". Rest assured with a team like this our beloved independent comic books are in capable hands and this will truly be the Year of the Hound.
