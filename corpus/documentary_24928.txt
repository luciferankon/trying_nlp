A living legacy of evolution is alive and well in arctic America. For generations Alaska's eastern Beaufort Sea has sustained the health of its hunters: polar bears and Inupiat Eskimos. Truly home only in the Arctic both are adapted to thrive in the harshest environment on the planet. With respectful conservation of the Arctic Ocean the timeless balance between land sea human and animal may endure indefinitely.
