Located on the outskirts of Hollywood are 'Rennie Renfro' (qv)'s kennels home to some of the greatest dog actors in the Hollywood movie business. It takes much work to get just the right performance by any animal required for any given movie. Using one of his star dogs 'Daisy (VIII)' (qv) Rennie demonstrates some of his training techniques. Because the animals work in sound movies they must be trained using silent cues. These training techniques are put into practice as a multitude of different animal actors and their respective trainers show what the animals can do in a revue styled performance.
