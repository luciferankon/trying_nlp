Two women who are unrelated and have never met but very much alike found their lives intertwined when people close to them mistook them for one another. Angela Pelayo (Vina Morales) was an innocent girl from the province trying to find a better life with a good job in the city while Anita Cornejo (Vina Morales) was a prostitute and girlfriend of a cold-hearted pimp. Both their lives are in danger but only one will be saved.
