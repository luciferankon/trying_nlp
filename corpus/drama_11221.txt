The four female protagonists reflect and pontificate on their lives in relation to men and the society in which they inhabit as unequal citizens striving to make a life for themselves. Their reflections are at times amusing and sad but above all devastatingly revealing delving deep into the human condition. A story of our times that dares us to confront ourselves! What lies in the darkness is never what is first perceived.
