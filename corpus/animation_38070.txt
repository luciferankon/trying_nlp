Thinking the grass is greener on the other side Porkchop leaves everyone from "..The Farm" behind for a shot at the "Big Times" as a guitar player in the city. Through hilarious antics he realizes that "different" grass isn't always "better" grass and that he was unappreciative for the blessings he had at home. Porkchop heads back to Farmer Bob to apologize for not being grateful only to be welcomed with open arms.
