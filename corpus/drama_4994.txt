This is a film about the life of a family of marginal thiefs and how destiny punishes each and every one of its members. A constant contrast between a violent and a domestic world in which violence humor and irony give a new layer to the social and moral conflicts of the characters. A lost house in a forest an underground bar a prison a bus fields and highways are the spaces on which thieves truckers cooks and hookers collide.
