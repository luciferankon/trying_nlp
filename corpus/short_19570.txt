Fifteen years after the war ended I felt it was time to address the past. As the result of the war I lost my Yugoslavian identity and refused to follow others in choosing national and religious affiliations which were only worsening the conflict. The neutral position I chose partially inspired my work Only The Chimney Stays. The fragmentation of the visuals and sounds are reflections of the displacement of people experiences and the way we process memories. The poetic narrative is the recollection of my personal experience and the effects of not belonging here or there. Mixed with uneasy memories is a simple beauty which moves me forward to fully enjoy my life but still be aware of the issues that surround us.
