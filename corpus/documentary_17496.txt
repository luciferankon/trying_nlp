'The Border Wall' is a new documentary from Wayne Ewing ('Breakfast with Hunter') about the attempt by the US Department of Homeland Security to erect 670 miles of barriers along the 2000 mile southern border of the United States in the waning days of the Bush administration. In 2008 Ewing explored the border to reveal the ineffectiveness of this discontinuous wall its ill effects upon wildlife and communities and the resistance of border residents. The film presents a vital public policy question with a new administration taking office: will we continue to spend millions to build ineffective walls across our southern border or will we tackle the real underlying problems of comprehensive immigration reform to stem the tide of illegal immigrants?
