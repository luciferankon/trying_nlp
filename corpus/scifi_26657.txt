Every day they venture out until one day they return having completely lost 4 hours from their lives. Their need to understand the UFO's and why they are here opens a world they could never have imagined and takes them into the heart of a dark and secretive universe populated by the Men in Black. Coming face to face with the unknown they begin to realize that they have been profoundly affected by their encounter. To make matters worse they begin to evolve into something amazing yet horrifying - something beyond their worst nightmares. Beware the Dark Watchers.
