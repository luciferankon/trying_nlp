Chase Russell a new college graduate finds herself stuck in the same house in which she grew up hanging out with the same people going to the same places and living with the same inescapable label of being a "slut". Her best friend Tibb (who is known by all as the pretty rich girl) lives vicariously through the adventurous Chase - often bribing her to be outrageously daring. One night the girls stumble upon a group of attractive boys that all belong to the town's elusive cult-like Christian congregation - "Disciples of Noah". This church believes strongly in the sanctity of animals and their relationships to humans. The church also endorses high morals and excommunicates anyone that has sex outside of a marriage - which gives Tibb an idea. It seems the restless Chase cannot keep a job. But knowing that she has to save a small fortune to move to New York and pursue a dream of writing Chase reluctantly accepts Tibb's generous bribe to seduce the cutest boy in the congregation (and the preacher's son) Gabe Sullivan.
