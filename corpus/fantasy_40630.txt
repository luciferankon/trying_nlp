At Summoner's Academy located in the city of Demacia a cohort of students with one common interest create the high school's first League of Legends club. The game warps the players inside a virtual reality using a digital headset produced by Rito Games. All is well until an evil self-proclaimed genius hacker thwarts the corporation's success by infiltrating a highly encrypted glitch into the system. With a countdown of 7 days set by the perpetrator the distressed CEO puts up a reward of 1 million Rito Points (a currency within the game) to unearth the miscreant in conjunction with sending out the company's own specialized hacker force. If the villain claims victory League of Legends will be terminated forever.
