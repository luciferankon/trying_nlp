A cat burglar with a case of diarrhea heads for the head bag of swag in hand and triggers a silent alarm. The security company calls one resident who begins his hunt for the intruder; two other residents are also alerted by the sounds of flatulence so they too are on the hunt one armed with a gun one with a golf club. A noisy toilet-roll holder adds to the burglar's problems.
