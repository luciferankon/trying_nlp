After Hours singin' swingin' and all that jazz that's how this variety special was advertised. CBS daytime stars from As the World Turns and The Young and the Restless perform songs and dance. Keith performs Razzle-Dazzle Don sings Remember and Beau performs Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show. Fun!
