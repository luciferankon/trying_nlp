Precious Wheels Above tells the story of San Francisco author Robert Fulton Bailey a broken man now known best for his series of Hamptons-set potboilers. However Bailey lived a previous life as a respected author of serious novels and New Yorker-style short stories. His creative "devolution" was clearly triggered around the time of his paparazzo brother's sudden stroke and resulting death. Because of a brutal and ongoing character-assassination campaign against him Bailey goes into exile living in a remote cabin with an Oregon cryptozoologist who is tracking the sasquatch. Somehow deeply touched by the cryptozoologist and her unshakable faith in the existence of the creature he is inspired to write his first "serious novel" in years. Many factors threaten to interfere setting the stage for a series of complex emotional and creative crises.
