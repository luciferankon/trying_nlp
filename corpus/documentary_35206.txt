Names are important especially when you're choosing what to name a world-class nightclub. So what name do you go with? For entrepreneur John W. Chang it wasn't too hard to settle on Webster Hall - a New York City Megaclub which has hosted the likes of Madonna Prince U2 Guns and Roses and the Wu-Tang Clan. Chang a Korean-American from Guam secures the licensing rights to the Webster Hall name and chooses to build his club in the resort town of Punta Cana Dominican Republic. In a matter of months he must assemble a team bring them to the Caribbean and build a nightclub from scratch in time for tourism season. When the global economic meltdown hits in the middle of construction stress builds and finances become tight. Conflict ensues among team members judges weigh in on arguments to prevent spilt blood and potential bankruptcy becomes apparent as profits dwindle along with the hired staff. Chang's MBA school may not have prepared him well enough to deal with so much at once but he will claw his way out of this crisis if he needs to.
