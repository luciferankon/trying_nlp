Huang Sheng is knocked unconscious to an iron cage. The captor asks Huang to explain the "Missing Sarira Case" that grabs the whole country. A year ago Huang was an unknown security captain. He is called "detective" when he breaks the "Missing Sarira Case". As Huang Sheng continues more and more truths come out: local property developers violently demolish people do anything to get fame and people hide the truth for their own good. The film is a metaphor for the living conditions of the bottom people. People get ignored and numb to protect the traditional culture. The "Sarira" in the film also implies a lack of belief. The Truth is being debunked slowly. The film embraces an ancient Chinese shadow show and the Aria-Lao Qiang. Humanity is imprisoned in a cage. People are like the controlled lifting puppets unable to walk out of the human predicament also cannot go out of the iron cage of life.
