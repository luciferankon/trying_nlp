A group of teenagers from Sydney Australia join an international robot-building competition for the first time. The high school students hail from a range of different high-schools and backgrounds and have six weeks to build a multifunctional soccer-playing robot. Most of them have never done anything like it before. After six weeks they accompany the robot to New Hampshire U.S.A. where it competes against 48 other robots in the high-pressure sporting environment that is 'FIRST Robotics Competition'.
