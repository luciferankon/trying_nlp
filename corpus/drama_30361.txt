One year ago Stephan and his brother's father died at the wetland the Wadden Sea. No one knows what happened. He seemed in good condition and knew the Wadden Sea which can be crossed at low tide by heart. One year later the two brothers meet again for a remembrance day. Two different personalities. Stephan doesn't have a job he was sent away from teaching. He isn't married and spends his time riding the bike. His brother is married but not too happily. He is a businessman. But the differences go further. The two brothers aren't exactly fond of each other. Is a day walking together on the wads enough to relieve the tension between the two?
