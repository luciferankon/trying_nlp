Sethji is a widowed a businessman and lives a comfortable life with his only daughter Hansa his son-in-law Rahul and a grandson Munna. He has Rahul as his right-hand man and a nephew named Dinesh who also assists in running the business. Petty rivalries and jealousies have grown in the family and Sethji and Rahul feel that Dinesh is now trying to undermine the business. They would like to get rid of him without attracting any attention to themselves. They do terminate Dinesh but this affects Sethji's health and he dies. Shortly thereafter Hansa also dies leaving Rahul to look after the business on his own. But there are many questions unanswered like why was no one in attendance with the ailing Sethji; Hansa's death was a suicide why was it covered up?; what of the affair that Rahul is having with Janki their maidservant who is full of venom against the family; and the involvement of Anita Rahul's secretary in his personal life. With the police getting involved it is time for them to either come clean or go their separate ways.
