Thirsty intertwines three stories of very separate and individual women all looking for the same thing to be quenched. This 95-minute 16mm color negative film introduces you to three amazingly real and vibrant women Eileen Hannah and Marty. While these characters never meet the common themes that link them are universal for women of all backgrounds. The desire to understand and to be understood the need to love regardless of society's constraints and the necessity to find a voice in today's fast paced fast food world.
