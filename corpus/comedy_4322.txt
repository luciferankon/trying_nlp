Its Bud Stiltner's 69th birthday and his three children are coming home to visit: Edgar the oldest is a proud 100% American who hates everyone and everything; Roger the middle child is a young successful writer; and Lurli the youngest is a stripper and call girl who lives in her own private world. There's also their step-mom - former stripper Veronica who still thinks she's 16 and gorgeous. But there's tension within the family - Roger has written a memoir about his hillbilly family which has become a best seller and the family wants justice.
