Victoria is a young pretty and ambitious swimmer. She works hard to succeed and so do they rivals at a training camp. But for them a swimming-pool is not the only place to train. And it's always better to excerise a body when a girl has a company of a hunky guy-or even two. Victoria feels lonely especially when she falls in love with a handsome coach Adam. But luck is on her side. Adam celebrates his birthday in company of six girls and three friends. It's a no-clothes-party. Two girls get double-penetrared side by side.
