In the flow of life stories of joy and sorrow take place. What's the price they pay for love and bread? Will their dreams ever come true? In longing do we taste the flavor of money and honey...The film also records the development of a unique female friendship as the director became a messenger whose camera relayed the feelings and thoughts of the migrant workers and their families to each other.
