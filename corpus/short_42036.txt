It seems however that through the paradoxical lens of life; the moment we accept the part of ourselves that we hate is the very moment it ceases to destroy us. This is Sofia's story and how she came into this world with light got lost in the realm of external approval and overcame the challenges on her journey to self love in order to pursue her dreams.
