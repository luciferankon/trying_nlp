At the age of nineteen Claude lands himself in a maximum security penitentiary. His strong will and good looks immediately land him in trouble with Tarzan the leader of a ruthless prison gang. Claud's talents as a fighter squash Tarzan's brutal advances but at a high price. Now his life is in danger. Zi zi a rival gang leader notices Claude's potential and offers him protection. But in return Claude must stand up to members of the Tarzan gang in organised fights for control of prison territory. As the battle intensifies and the fights become more brutal and dangerous Claude senses himself sinking deeply into Zizi's clutches. In desperation he appeals to The Phantom a twenty - year veteran of the penitentiary. But when a horrifying experience experience shakes Claude to the core will he listen to the Phantom and resist the call for vengeance? # That's what's on the back of the DVD cover I think the film must have been a B movie the acting is bad the fight sequences are poor and the plot is gruesome and sick! Hardly a Van Damme prison film!
