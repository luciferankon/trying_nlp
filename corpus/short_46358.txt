'Aarhus Stories' is the result of an untraditional partnership between film directors and song writers. The song writers' songs replace the traditional manuscript and challenge the director in an entirely new way. The films have all been shot in Aarhus in 24 hours and they all last three to ten minutes. Giant Sand front man Howe Gelb from Tucson Arizona and artistic director Bruce Gladwin from the Australian theatre company Back to Back Theatre are the men behind this alternative Aarhus Story.
