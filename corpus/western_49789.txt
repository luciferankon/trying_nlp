The ranch of Red Ryder (Allan Lane) and his aunt The Duchess (Martha Wentworth) is being used as the training site for "Gentleman Jim" Corbett (George Turner) for his upcoming fight in Carson City Nevada for the heavyweight championship against Bob Fitzsimmons (John Dehner). Molly McVey (Peggy Stewart) the daughter of a U.S. Senator crusading against prize-fighting in Nevada complicates matters soemwhat when she conceives the bright idea of having Corbett kidnapped thus causing the cancellation of the fight. The two men (George Chesebro and George Lloyd) she hires to do the kidnapping also add to the complications by kidnapping Ryder instead of Corbett. Meanwhile a gang of crooks led by McKean (Roy Barcroft) descend on the town intent on looting the town and also making off with the fight proceeds.
