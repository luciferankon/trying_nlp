STUDIO at the MEMO is a live entertainment format that brings the best cabaret burlesque circus dance and music performers together with a house band to back all the acts in an atmosphere that feels like Berlin between the wars Rick's Caf√© in Casablanca and Las Vegas in the Rat Pack era. The host is Tim Rogers a bona fide rock star who also performs a couple of songs with the house band and chats to some of the artists. A provocative mix of edgy dangerous and refreshing studio or location based arts and entertainment programming.
