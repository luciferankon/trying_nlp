Pluto can't help himself. Adopting the roles of various people of different ages statuses and personalities Paul "Pluto" Strauss spends his daily life interfering with the lives of strangers. Dealing with his father's recent suicide he uses his endless time and countless money to escape his unhappy reality in pursuit of something a little more entertaining. While he's not harassing people he's never met he spends the rest of his time inconveniencing (and often embarrassing) those closest to him. It is not until Olivia a girl from his past reenters his life that Pluto must acknowledge the weight of his lies and the consequences they bring.
