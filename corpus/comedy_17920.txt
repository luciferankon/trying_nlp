The polite and chaste high-school scholar Archimedes and his best friend Panos a trainer and seductive philanderer work in the same school sharing the same house. To be more specific Archimedes being conservative shy and prude is the exact opposite of his friend Panos a modern and easygoing type of person who knows how to enjoy life. Nevertheless despite Panos' considerable efforts to teach Archimedes a contemporary and laid-back attitude much to his friend's chagrin the scholar remains immovable to his lifestyle but only during the day. As a result when Archimedes sleepwalks at night under a completely different personality he mysteriously becomes the cool guy in his dreams furthermore unaware of his condition he gets constantly involved in crazy and comical situations.
