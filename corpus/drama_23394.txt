Wealthy young Rex Van Zile is madly in love with pretty Myrtle Davis but she is so absorbed in the task she has taken on to herself of reforming Skid-Row derelicts that she pays no attention to Rex's affections. Dejected he commiserates with his friends Harry Richardson and Clay Cullum and through them he meets young Polly Shannon who is employed as a maid in their household in order to pay her way to Paris she she wants to study opera. Polly and her employers come up with a scheme to get Myrtle to notice Rex but it doesn't quite turn out the way they planned.
