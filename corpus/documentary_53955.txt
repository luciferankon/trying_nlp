The documentary "Lazio a 0 Km region" deals with the benefits of a possible adhesion of the region to the 0 km initiative and with the wide possibilities that this idea of market can meet the habits of the contemporary society. The big distribution productions are compared to the short supply chain situation and witnesses testify a conflict approach: who loves quality who doesn't care who just wants to save. We tell how in a changing and economically challenged era consumptions are affected and consumers pay more attention on them but it is possible to discover the true commercial strength of the "near" products and the human value behind them which allow a development based on a better awareness of Lazio culture and cultivation a green sustainability and a natural freshness of the products.
