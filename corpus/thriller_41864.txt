Lovely widow Megan lost her soldier husband and childhood sweetheart to the Iraq conflict eight years ago and believes she will never find or trust love again. Bitterly divorced city high flier David is in the critical stages of the biggest and most ruthless deal of his life and the last thing he needs is love. However when the pair meet sparks unexpectedly fly and against all the odds Megan's defences at last begin to wash away... Until David's charged with murder. A murder whose roots go deep into the darker sordid underbelly of high city finance and abuse and deep into David's own dark past and the evidence of his guilt is irrefutable. Now will her love for a man she's only just begun to trust be enough to overcome the overwhelming case against him and will the truth ever really be known?
