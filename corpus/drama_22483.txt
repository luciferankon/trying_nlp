Neville Crane finds himself at a Revivalist meeting conducted by Evangelist Milton Laud who is launching a "Save Mankind" mission in London. Crane suspects there is a dubious financial background to Laud's campaign and writes an exposé which the editor after taking legal advice decides to print. But Laud to the horror and surprise of "The Globe" sues the paper for Ł25000 damages for libel.
