Vegas Girl consists of flashbacks and present time in the 1970's era of Vegas glamour and grotesqueness. Maggie and Laraine's story- a Sin City-style mixed with The Glass Castle-encapsulates the surreal life of Las Vegas and chronicles Maggie's early years of struggle and grief as she raised herself in a "reality" where nothing was real. She creates a future free of cruelty fear and dysfunction far outside the glamorous yet soulless city in which she grew up.
