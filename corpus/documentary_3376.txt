An exploration of the thesis that all life is but a grand movie. It chronicles the real life road trip of a family of artists on route to the "Burning Man" festival in the Nevada desert. An homage to the film making of Russ Meyer. Ultimately once arriving at Burning Man they attempt to create a group-interactive project called "Hands Across the Man" which celebrates our collective 'Unity in Diversity' and the miracle of being alive.
