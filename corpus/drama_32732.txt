A brash irreverent and poetically playful collage of stories about people in Singapore who run away and disappear forever. Two children run away from home and discover an ancient underground network of monsoon drains tunnels and caves. An army officer obsessed with order and discipline realizes that life isn't so black and white. A painfully shy man reluctantly saves his neighbor and experiences a spiritual awakening. Concocted from a heady mix of realism and poetic fantasy Invisible Children is sometimes funny sometimes poignant but always thought-provoking.
