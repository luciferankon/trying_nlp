Featuring sitcom legend Price Is Right host and proud Clevelander Drew Carey Reason Saves Cleveland investigates and analyzes the problems that turned Cleveland from the nation's sixth-largest city in 1950 into today's "Mistake By The Lake." Like all too many American cities Cleveland seems locked into a death spiral shedding people jobs and dreams like nobody's business. When it comes to education business climate redevelopment and more Clevelanders have come to expect the worse. Is a renaissance possible? Of course it is but only if the city's leaders and residents are willing to learn from other cities such as Houston Chicago Oakland and Indianapolis. And only if they're willing to try new approaches to old problems. Reason.tv's Nick Gillespie narrates and talks with educators elected officials businesspeople policy experts and residents from all walks of life in order to find ways to fix the "mistake on the lake" as well other once-great American cities.
