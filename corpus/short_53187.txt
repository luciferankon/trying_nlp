Caroline has just won the best solo performance award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival with a play based entirely on her grandmother Christiane's formidable and often hilarious life. Christiane now 91 and whose memory and eyesight are fading fast has not yet seen the play so Caroline decides to take it to her at the nursing home where she now lives. As she makes her way to the nursing home Caroline feels increasingly anxious and preoccupied about Christiane's reaction to the play and is unable to escape the thought that maybe she's left it all too late. Once at the home as she prepares to perform on a makeshift stage Caroline's only concern is that something anything of what she is about to re-enact will strike a chord with her beloved grandmother.
