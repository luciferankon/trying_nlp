A quiz show in which the contestants were the viewers. Host Bill Cullen dressed in academic robes posed a series of statements to viewers for them to assess as correct or incorrect. (For example: "The width of a standard gauge railroad track between the rails is four feet eight and one half inches. Yes or no?") In each episode one of the 14 questions was asked not by Cullen but by a local announcer. Viewers wrote their answers to the questions on a postcard and mailed them to their local television station along with a 15th yes-or-no question of their own. The respondents in each market with the most correct answers won prizes provided by local sponsors with ties being broken by the quality of the respondent's own submitted question.
