Bangshi Das is an impersonator of Charlie Chaplin. He earns peanuts by being the 'joker' at birthday parties. However he prefers to call himself an actor rather than a worker. His life circles around his son who is the greatest critic of his performances. Poverty never seems bitter as the father-son duo knows how to make fun of it. Someone rightly told about this movie "Such movie never happened in Bengali cinema ever before". The out of the box thinking of the plot how a caricature of Charlie Chaplin acts in different private ceremony of birthday parties marriage etc to entertain mass and earn their supper and go ahead against all odds in their life wearing a smile on their face always & living a simple life really teach us the spirit of life and you are bound to shed a couple of tear when you finish this cinematic journey yet having a smile on your face. Rudranil was stupendous and probably his most commendable performance in his life with perfect co-ordination of innocent & honest act of the child artist Soham Maitra as Nimua. Excellent soundtracks by Indradeep Dasgupta is another highlight of this movie.
