Documentary looks at the development of vibrant bike culture in Vancouver Canada and how the city's self-propelled population mobilized to promote the bicycle as a viable for of transport. You Never Bike Alone shows how the foundation for today's burgeoning bike scene in the city was set in the early Nineties when cyclists risked arrest by cycling en masse to publicize unsafe road conditions and rides of the mid-Nineties which were sometimes characterized by arrests. Rides with mutant bike collective MC3 The Wholesome Undie (an underwear ride where cyclists protest the Molson Indy) and the World Naked Bike Ride provide amusing and entertaining spectacle while film also shows how cyclists are dealing with road rage and the political struggle at municipal and provincial levels to create a more livable city.
