The government has been testing anti swine flu drugs on criminals that are serving life in an Irish prison for horrendous crimes before introducing the drugs to the general public. However the experiment goes wrong and the criminals are shipped to a laboratory in London. On the voyage the inmates turn into zombies and attack the boat. They end up being washed up on the picturesque beach of Llanddwyn on the isle of Anglesey North Wales where they feast on everything and everyone in sight. Will they make it over the Menai bridge and onto the mainland or will they be stopped in time!
