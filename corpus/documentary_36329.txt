Set in a small town in the region of Tamil Nadu in southern India the film follows the days and works of a hijra family. Silky Mahima Trisha Durga Kuyili Priyanka Vasundhara and Yamuna under the firm protection of their guru Lakshmi Ma deliver snippets of their marginal but sovereign existence. From a millenia-old sacred tradition to getting by every second "Guru" composes with them a poem of intertwined voices in which the world is a tough playground where the third gender is primarily the resistance force of a life shared.
