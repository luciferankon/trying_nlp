Pregnant Man Thomas Beatie recently made headlines again after revealing he and his wife are separating after nine years of marriage. As you may recall the 38-year-old was born a woman but is now legally a male even though he has preserved his female reproductive organs. Beatie says he got pregnant because his wife Nancy was unable to have children after a hysterectomy. On Thursday night he sat down with HLN's Dr. Drew and talked about the relationship he has with his three children: Susan 3 Jensen 2 and Austin 1 "My name is daddy" Beatie said. "My name is no longer Thomas. My oldest daughter is almost 4 and she knows that she grew inside my belly. She knows I grew got bigger and bigger and bigger and soon came out. It's the task of telling her not all men get pregnant." When Susan begins raising questions Beatie says "I plan on being honest and open [about] where she came from."
