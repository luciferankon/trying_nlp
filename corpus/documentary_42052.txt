Through family photographs archive footage and mainly empty shots of the streets of Buenos Aires the films recovers fragments from the past of a family. Emigration separation longing loneliness and pain are the ingredients of a raw film where compassion and sentimentalism are absent. A woman meets her brother after 50 years of absence. In those days Galician people emigrated to Argentina to make money. Five decades later the grandchildren orphaned and poor knock on Europe's door. The long empty shots the formal radicalism of the film are the necessary tools to picture this painful absence.
