An epic tale in an intimate scale as one of the actors described it. The Hudson Guild Theater Company invites you to join them on their epic quest to deliver a story that might not otherwise make its way to the the Chelsea community. Join Jim Furlong and the Hudson Guild Theatre Company as they seek to condense Richard Wagner's epic 15 hour opera into a 90 minute play. And in the process bring together an unlikely group of people to create a world built entirely from their hearts and imaginations.
