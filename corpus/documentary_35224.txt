THE POWER OF WORDS takes its form from R. Lee Cantelon's book THE WORDS: Jesus of Nazareth where the core words of Christ are edited together without the rest of the intervening text. It is Jesus' words in and of themselves that teach believers how to live and how faith makes a difference in their lives. This book offers the message of Christ in language that is easy to understand and has exposed the Words of Jesus to many non-traditional readers who are curious about the meaning and depth of Christ's Words. Cantelon's book has been translated into more than twenty languages including Arabic and Chinese. It was also awarded the Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur by the Catholic Church. This uplifting film chronicles a two year experience a journey through the creation of this testament featuring visionary teacher Michael Bernard Beckwith (The Secret). His words of wisdom anchor and validate the spiritual experiences expressed by the Grammy-winning artists featured in this powerful production whose life-changing encounters are expressed through THE WORDS: Jesus of Nazareth. THE POWER OF WORDS reveals the personal behind-the-scenes moments you won't find anywhere else. Experience the Journey!
