With an introduction by Howard Cosell and an audience filled with celebrity fans The Main Event is a real standout show. Filmed live at Madison Square Garden a venue famed for having huge concert productions and sporting events the Chairman stands solo and makes the massive venue feel intimate. The audience clearly feels the energy and Sinatra even joins in as the fans are dancing in the aisles to Bad Bad Leroy Brown. Sinatra's version of You Are The Sunshine Of My Life is a joy to watch. His story telling and anecdotes are as poignant as ever.
