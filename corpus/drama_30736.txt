The selfish Dr. André Luiz dies and awakes in a kind of limbo called "Umbral". After a painful and numb period in a gruesome swamp he is rescued and brought to "Nosso Lar" (meaning "Our Home") a spiritual city. He finds a place of harmony where people live in peace working for the good of humanity for the self evolution and awaiting for reincarnation. Sooner André Luiz changes his behavior becoming a more self aware and altruist man.
