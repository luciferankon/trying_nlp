LowDown Blues is about an unlikely encounter of a southern Caucasian janitor Jeb and a recent Korean immigrant Mike. Mike's eccentric mistakes in his first training night as a janitor's assistant gradually frustrate Jeb and Jeb fires Mike on the spot. The story is based on a real story and subtextually tackles down the issues of cultural misconnection stereotypes and American materialism in a mode of satiric comedy.
