A woman lives "under siege" externally and internally. She is focused and rigid she doesn't want to accept the death of her brother and lives with the dominant feeling of the necrosis of time. It is her defense a fact that happened within time. Nothing can get her out of this state of nonexistence because it will confirm the death of her brother; except if someone comes to take his place under the condition of the "milt lie".
