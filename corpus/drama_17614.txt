During summer vacation on Fire Island three young people--a girl and two guys--become so close that they form a sort-of threesome. When an uncool girl tries to infiltrate the trio's newly found relationship they construct an elaborate plot that has violent results. Late teens Sandy Peter and Dan meet while their respective families vacation for the summer on Fire Island New York. They instantly bond - initially over the rescue of an injured seagull - with the three entering into a friendship where they do everything together in solidarity with little respect for others especially the adult figures in their life. They almost become indistinguishable as individuals when together such as being in a gang. Things change when they meet another vacationing teen named Rhoda later in the summer. Rhoda is shy seemingly insecure (which the three later learn for good reason) overly analytical and straight-laced but she needs the acceptance of her peers. Then the individual personalities of the three friends begins to emerge Peter being the sensitive one Dan the overly confident one who may not have reason to be and Sandy the manipulative one especially in using her sexuality to control the two males. But Rhoda in asserting her own beliefs may not have a chance when dealing with the three as a group.
