The city and the snow-covered forest represent polarized elements. The identity of that which is represented however remains ambiguous. The thematic form of the film leads to a new intangible perspective wherein a multiplicity of possible perspectives and meanings lead to a single concept on the horizon. It is a silent narrative which becomes a "trance" film. The core concept is built upon the idea of a constantly oscillating shift between two poles much like the harmonic motion of a guitar string. The identity of positive and negative or of each of the two opposites is constantly changing. However all parallel lines converge as they meet the horizon of human perception.
