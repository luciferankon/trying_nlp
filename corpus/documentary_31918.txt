Shock jock pioneer Steve Dahl declared that July 14 1979 would be the end of disco when he blew up thousands of disco records in the outfield at Comisky Park in Chicago. Ten thousand Loop fans stormed the field in the middle of a White Sox/Tigers doubleheader rioting setting fires and the event made national headlines...and made Dahl a household name...and a Chicago legend.
