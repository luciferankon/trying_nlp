Deep within the Manistee National Forest in the weeks leading up to Halloween tattooed villagers in Walkerville Michigan are falling victim to a giant mad man dressed as a surgeon who extracts their tattoos before brutally murdering them and leaving their bodies - or boy PARTS to be found later in and around the village. Beautiful classical music plays while a giant mad man dressed as a surgeon cuts and rips tattoos from his helpless victims who are tied down naked to a cold steel autopsy table. All they can do is scream. Walkerville's Sheriff Kerry calls on Captain Parker of the Grand Rapids Homicide Department to help him and his three deputies on these strange and macabre cases. With each murder thought the trusting villagers become more and more suspicious and accusatory towards each other. Fingers point and fists fly as Sheriff Kerry and Captain Parker try to work together on the strange cases in their unique small town and big city ways to try and find a serial killer hiding in the villiage. While reading you can go to the Tattoo: A Beautiful Sin website and listen to the classical pieces that the surgeon is playing as you get to them in the film. It is a truly unique experience for the senses.
