Berlin 1990: soon after the collapse of the wall in the atmosphere of the approaching reunion of Germany. Invited by his friends-actors who have been living abroad for years now Max a Polish stage director arrives in Berlin. Working together they try to carry out their dream: to stage a performance suspended by the martial law ten years earlier. The way they raise the money - moonlighting selling pieces of the historical wall coping with the soulless inflexible machine of bureaucracy - constitutes the central often humorous plot of the film. In their efforts the four protagonists are allied by Regina an interpreter familiar with the local habits and practices.
