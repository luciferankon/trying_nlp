Freddie is 8 years old and full of ideas. If her first idea doesn't work maybe her next one will! Her younger brother Leo tags along -even if he sometimes is a bit afraid to. The adventure is always around the corner. "Loud Mouth Marcus" who is 10 years old causes a lot of trouble and he never misses an opportunity to tease the siblings. But what goes around comes around!
