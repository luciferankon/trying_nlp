Grigorov is a commander of a group of sailors sent to help in a village farm. There he meets Radi - a smart and ambitious boy. Grigorov tells his life principle to him - to walk against the wind with a straight head. Years later the boy becomes a captain and a submarine commander and is subordinate of Grigorov. Radi has not taken any action against sailors that have beaten up their comrade. Grigorov punished Radi but soon after he hits this "mama's boy" himself. Grigorov is left with his pride with Radi who is like a son to him and who always "walks against the wind".
