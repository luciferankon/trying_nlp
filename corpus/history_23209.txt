Pivovarov's documentary is about the story of the betrayal of the prominent Soviet general and the soldiers of his army who fought heroically but were declared traitors. Vlasov had a reputation of Stalin's favorite child. In 1942 the Big Boss instructed Vlasov to a new important mission. No one could have predicted that very soon the general's name would be as nominal as the name of Judas.
