This interesting little fairy tale as depicted in this beautifully colored film shows us the old miller dividing his fortune among his three sons. All of his earthly possessions only comprise a mill donkey and a cat. The elder sons receive the mill and the donkey while the youngest boy Arthur receives the puss and is very much disappointed with his share of the loot never dreaming that in the end the cat would be the means of bringing him good fortune. He takes his legacy and goes up to the mill and while there alone the puss is transformed into a supernatural being the size of a man and with the intellect of a man. He is fitted out with a beautiful mantle and a new pair of boots and becomes the sole companion of lonesome Arthur. They go on a pilfering expedition and are fortunate in trapping some rare game which Puss takes and presents to the King with the compliments of his master. Next he and Arthur are walking through the woods when they see the Princess and her suitor out driving and Puss hits upon a scheme whereby his master can gain the recognition of the beautiful girl. He makes the youth jump into the water and feign drowning while he rushes out to spread the alarm. Meeting the royal party he tells them of the terrible fate of his master and they all hasten to lend a helping hand. When they rescue the young rascal the Princess gives orders to have him placed in her carriage and here Arthur has an opportunity to tell her of his love and is finally successful in winning her hand. The next picture is after the betrothal and Arthur and his lady love are driving over the vast estates: they go on to the castle where orders are given for the wedding feast. In the last view we see the triumph of Puss who is Supervisor-in-Chief at the royal wedding of his master and the Princess.
