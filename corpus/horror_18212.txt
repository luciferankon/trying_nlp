When a man is tired of London he is tired of life. "Why Sir you find no man at all intellectual who is willing to leave London. No Sir when a man is tired of London he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford." There is an energy about London. An intangible abstract force that pervades you upon arrival and follows you on departure silently but potently beseeching you to return. The energy is addictive. For many this addiction can be used to sculpt a lifestyle most would dream of; tapping into the city's treasure chest of opportunity and potential catching a glimpse perhaps of the vast wealth that flows through the cities coffers from every corner of the world. This sense of possibility allures tens of thousands of bright young things every year. For others this 'London' is an idea that is never realised. The energy becomes a disease; an affliction in which one is made perpetually aware that they have not been so well served by London's prosperity. In a city where everything is possible those darkest things are too equally inescapable. Drugs crime poverty. During the 2012 Olympics many were not so keen for this London to be broadcast to the world. Homeless were shifted from popular areas the streets made squeaky clean as the world watched politicians smiling at cameras with plastic grins. Life is complex complicated and baffling. If one city could tell the story of the world which would you choose? There are numerous contenders. This is about one in which 300 languages are spoken one which has ruled half the world one which stood alone against a Fascism that had swept all of Europe. This is a city that has not been invaded for almost a thousand years. This is a story of London. It is not 'the' story because such a thing does not exist in a city that hums on the heartbeats of 8 million souls. This is London in a Dream.
