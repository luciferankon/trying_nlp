Union Leader Vijay Saxena wants his employer Dhanraj to treat his employees as shareholders and for this purpose he presents him a cheque of 10 lakh rupees being their contribution which Dhanraj accepts. Then the company shows huge losses as a result the employees are unhappy and are certain that Dhanraj has manipulated the accounts to show a loss. To make matters worse an employee loses his leg and is hospitalized unable to be employed there anymore. Dhanraj promises a compensation of Rs.60000/- but the worker only ends up getting Rs.10000/-. When Vijay confronts Dhanraj he is told that Mohan another employee may have been responsible for stealing the balance Rs.50000/-. Vijay threatens to kill Mohan and shortly thereafter Mohan's dead body is found with multiple stab wounds also killed are his wife and child. Vijay is caught red-handed arrested by Police Inspector Jaikishan Verma and tried in court. Jaikishan's wife Sub-Inspector Jyoti comes to his rescue in court testifying that she was with him at the time the murders took place thus shattering her married life with Jaikishan as well as the life of her sister Vidya who is to be married to Vijay. The question remains did Jyoti give a false testimony to save Vijay or is she really having an affair with him? Did Vijay really kill Mohan and his family?
