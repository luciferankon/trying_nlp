On holiday in the French Alps in January 1999 Jamie and his friend climbing partner Jamie Fisher became stranded in a violent blizzard at the top of a mountain called Les Droites. Perched on an icy ledge with no food and water and unable to move they were exposed to brutal weather for 5 days. Jamie Andrew was eventually rescued by helicopter in one of the most dramatic missions in the history of the Alps. By then his friend was had frozen to death. Jamie was rushed to hospital with hypothermia and severe frostbite. A few days later surgeons had to amputate his limbs. For many this would mean the end of all hope but not for Jamie. With the help of physiotherapy and prosthetics he learned to walk again and within a year was back in the Alps learning to snowboard. Then came marathons triathlons and perhaps inevitably a return to mountaineering. Now 14 years later Jamie takes on the biggest challenge of his life. He wants to climb one the most dangerous mountains in the Alps The Matterhorn. The perilous nature of the challenge is brought forcefully home during the training period when his new climbing partner Roger Payne one of Britain's leading mountaineers is killed in an avalanche. Jamie knows better than most that mountaineering is about making big decisions in extreme conditions. The Limbless Mountaineer follows this extraordinarily determined man as he pursues his dream.
