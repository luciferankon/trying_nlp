All Things Shining" is an experimental intermedial dramatic live cinema experience. At its heart it is a story about humanity as seen through the lens of a man facing his own mortality. The protagonist is Captain Matt Simon an astronaut leading the first manned mission to the planet Mars. The play travels through time providing a view into pivotal moments in the protagonist's past juxtaposed and interwoven with scenes that make up the dramatic present. In this way the play acts as a time machine allowing the audience to travel back and forth in the character's consciousness and experience in order to gain a whole picture of the protagonist as a proxy and metaphor for their own lives.
