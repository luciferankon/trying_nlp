Daniel Feeld is a screenwriter with pains in his gut and a new screenplay called "Karaoke" about a girl named Sandra who works in a seedy Karaoke bar and is murdered by a lowlife named Arthur "Pig" Mallion. But whenever Daniel looks around real people seem to be speaking his dialogue in real situations that mirror the script including a beautiful young girl named Sandra who works in a Karaoke bar owned by a Mr. Mallion. Meanwhile Balmer the film's director is in a spot of trouble with the leading lady of the film. Obsessive self-destructive London television scriptwriter Daniel Feeld finds his health failing while involved with the post-production on his new TV drama "Karaoke." A hard-drinking heavy smoker Feeld is in much physical pain as he struggles with pancreatic cancer. Going about his daily routines he has some odd experiences leading him to conclude that his fictional creations are erupting into real life. He overhears people speaking scraps of his own dialogue including young Sandra Sollars hostess at a karaoke club run by petty thug Arthur "Pig" Maillion. Feeld fears Sandra could be threatened by "Pig" Maillion in a manner similar to scenes he wrote for "Karaoke" as his memory fantasy and reality overlap and inter-weave into a complex mental tapestry.
