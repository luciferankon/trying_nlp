The last of the once wealthy Spottiswood family are siblings Albert and Harriet who try desperately to spruce up the crumbling old family mansion where they hope to impress the Fetherstones a visiting clan of British aristocrats with a marriageable daughter. They hire on an itinerant jack of all trades to be butler and cook and a door-to-door salesgirl to be the maid. Unfortunately a sham Hindoo Prince arrives to blackmail the Spottiswoods.
