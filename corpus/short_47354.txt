Tropism is the modification of different bodies and agencies to stimuli from the environment. Three women experienced it exposing its vulnerability as bodies react to different climatic and geographical conditions while listening to what happened at the time of filming and so did reception and perception of cinematic record because I was used as celluloid support both in super8 with underwater camera 16mm due and super 16 mm which was achieved also expose the material to experimentation and environmental vulnerability.
