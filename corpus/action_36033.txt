Santageddon is a multiplay-only team-deathmatch first person shooter which puts you amidst the battle for Christmas. The game is very similar to Quake and other more modern shooters when it comes to controls and multiplayer gameplay. You must choose between the good Christmas elves or the evil Se-Num Nato legions and dictate the outcome of the upcoming Christmas. The game gives you a selection of three characters for both sides each their own weapon selection. You can choose between an Elf base and Nato base as your fragfest location.
