Combined with his own impressive natural abilities Bishop was truly a one-man army. But something has gone wrong.

Each time he defeated all resistance and upset the delicate balance of world power. What happened to Bishop? Why is he attacking these installations? If someone doesn't find the answer soon Bishop might just become the world's kill switch.
