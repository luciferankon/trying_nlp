On the third floor of the apartment house at 003 Findlet Avenue lived Mr. and Mrs. Henry Tinkelpaw. The neighbors said it was a shame the way he neglected his poor wife but Tillie's avoirdupois seemed to belie the rumor. Directly above lived the Pipkins. In this case however it was the young wife whose numerous clubs called her frequently from her fireside affording gossip for the neighbors. However unmindful of the discussion of their affairs Tillie continued to cook dainty dishes for her unappreciative husband while Luella Pipkin found fault with everything her meek husband did to please her. For several weeks it happened that Tinkelpaw and Luella would accidentally meet at the door and naturally would walk down the street together. However on one occasion where Mr. Tinkelpaw had been less appreciative than usual and departed leaving Tillie in tears she went to the window hoping he might relent and throw her a kiss. At the same time Luella was out of sorts on account of having lost at bridge and when she left Pipkin also went to the window to see if she had really gone. What they saw affected them like a cold plunge. Both of them wrote to their faithless mates informing them that all was over; and on starting out into the world met in the hallway. Each recognized in the other a kindred soul; so linking arms they set forth. On Luella's return she found the note and frantically started in search of her husband. Tinkelpaw had also found a similar communication; so together they left in search of the truants. After following a devious trail they came upon them as they were attempting to use a photographer's automobile as an ocean liner. As the bedraggled Tillie is enfolded in her repentant husband's arms she winks slyly at Pipkin who is being fondled by a much chastened Luella.
