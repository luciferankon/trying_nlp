'Aarhus Stories' is the result of an untraditional partnership between film directors and song writers. The song writers' songs replace the traditional manuscript and challenge the director in an entirely new way. The films have all been shot in Aarhus in 24 hours and they all last three to ten minutes. An electronic 'wondergirl' a writer/musician/cartoonist and a talented animation film director are the key ingredients when Band Ane Rune T. Kidde and Anders Berthelsen from Ja Film challenge each other.
