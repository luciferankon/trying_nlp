Famed psychiatrist Dr. Virginia Grant is writing a book about young patients and their troubles in the modern world. Each 'chapter' in the book is a vignette in the movie.Sadly despite the fact it would be a much better flick with tons of gratuitous nudity most of the nudity is portrayed in psychedelic paintings in the opening credits. Psychiatrist Dr. Virginia Grant is writing a book about some of her more recent cases dealing with the hedonistic naively idealistic and misguided lifestyle of the youth at the dawn of a new decade. In an upper class family daughter Andrea catches her cold-hearted mother Faith cheating on her father. This strengthens her resentment towards her as well as her incestuous desire for her father who is too weak to say no. Things end in tragedy. Sisters Felicia and Ella go to a groovy drug party and lose their grip on reality. One of them freaks out. Teenage Annabelle and her two friends from high school hook up with top cat Paul who pimps them out. Anabelle's physician father plays a cruel practical joke on the girls to teach them a lesson they'll never forget. Tim is a submissive old man with a provocative young mistress who got bored with him and won't sleep with him anymore. He discovers in shock that her new lover is a woman. Now what? Finally doctor Grant's own rebellious daughter Diane has hooked up with a hippie political radical called Hal who's collecting money to set up his own youth political party. Virgina suspects something isn't quite right with Hal and decides to check out his operation herself after Diane refuses to listen to her.
