A docudrama will focus on four young university students as they follow their dream to build a robot that will win the annual robot competition (ROBOCON) in Ulaanbaatar Mongolia and bring recognition to themselves and their school. Fueled more by optimism and a passion for engineering than a practical and well thought out plan they begin work in a dark forbidding rented basement. They have little luck in finding sponsors to help them buy the necessary tools and parts for their creation and must scrounge or make many of the components themselves. They do not even have enough money to feed themselves while spending the endless hours of labor on their robot. Hunger and fatigue take their toll when minor personality conflicts erupt as the deadline nears. One of the students must repair a fractured relationship with his wife who just give birth to their baby. She got little support from him because of his drive to finish the robot. Eventually they approach the administration of their school for help and are given the use of a large well lit room to work in. It is here that they discover that part of their project the Traveling Robot is too large and must be completely rebuilt. Rushing to complete their work they hope to be able to put the finishing touches on their dream machine at the venue only to learn that they will be among the first contestants to go on. Out of time and out of luck their robot performs poorly. And while they reflect sadly on what might have been they also have a feeling of pride when they are awarded the trophy for being the hardest working team. And they know that by essentially creating something out of nothing they are indeed winners.
