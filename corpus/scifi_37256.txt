Invisible aliens in a tiny flying saucer come to Earth looking for heroin. They land on top of a New York apartment inhabited by a drug dealer and her female androgynous bisexual nymphomaniac lover a fashion model. The aliens soon find the human pheromones created in the brain during orgasm preferable to heroin and the model's casual sex partners begin to disappear. This increasingly bizarre scenario is observed by a lonely woman in the building across the street a German scientist who is following the aliens and an equally androgynous drug-addicted male model. (Both models are played by Anne Carlisle in a dual role.) Darkly funny and thoroughly weird. In New York a small flying saucer lands on the roof of a penthouse seeking for heroin. In the apartment the cocaine addicted model Margaret is a promiscuous bisexual androgynous woman that lives with her lover the drug dealer Adrian. Margaret has sex with many partners asking for cocaine in return. The aliens discover that the sensation of the orgasm is equivalent to the heroin and they suck the brains of Margaret's lovers killing them first and then making their bodies disappear. Meanwhile a German scientist is chasing the extraterrestrial beings and arrives in a building in front of Margaret's apartment to observe the creatures. Margaret is a fashion model who seeks to become famous but who finds herself consistently abused by the people in the fashion industry and in her own drug-using subculture. After she is drugged and raped by a man who had promised her cocaine she realizes that a mysterious force is killing everyone who has sex with her. She sets out to use this for revenge against those who have mistreated her. Meanwhile a German scientist realizes that Margaret's lovers are victims of aliens who feed on human neurotransmitters associated with pleasure and attempts to warn her that she too is in danger.
