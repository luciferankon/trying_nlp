This is not a story about war. Returning home to 1960's Australia the place he once called home followed by memories an ocean away. The most unlikely companion the only way to express the moments lived ones regretted and lessons not yet learned. The journey not of a man a family or a hero but of a life that lives through generations sharing stories when we lack the courage to tell them.
