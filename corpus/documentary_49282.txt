In 2015 reknown Cuban artist Tania Bruguera was imprisoned in Havana after advocating for freedom of expression. Shortly after her release she returned to the United States and located Dr. Frank M. Ochberg the founding father of trauma therapy particularly PTSD and Stockholm Syndrome. The filmed therapy sessions between them exposes an intimate yet profound analysis of Cuba surveillance and the politics in of repression embedded in government and family structures. Perhaps as a result of these sessions Tania Bruguera will run for President of Cuba in 2018.
