As Cariocas (the women from Rio) is a dramatic comedy presented as three different episodes based on stories by famed (in Brazil) Stanislau Ponte Preta. Each story is adapted and directed by a different director two of them now among Brazil's most acclaimed film makers. The 3 stories deal with the lives of 3 young Rio women. All three live in states of desperate loneliness in contrast to the apparently vibrant social scene in Copacabana then Rio's best and liveliest area arguably the world's most beautiful and swinging beach scene at the time (early to late 60s).
