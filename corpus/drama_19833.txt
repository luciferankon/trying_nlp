In Meredith California (a very small town) there was no doctor (only once a week on Wednesdays would a doctor fly in)  so Jesse Maloney (a "Practical Nurse") would take his place for the rest of the week. She would deliver the babies set the bones and saved the lives of Meredith for nearly a decade. Then one day (in this "true story") someone called the authorities and she gets arrested for practicing medicine without a license. With the strength of her convictions and overwhelming odds  she decides to fight her case in court and has the support of the entire town.
