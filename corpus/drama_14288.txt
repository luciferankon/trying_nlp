Five peoples' fates become entwined when a Marine returns on furlough from Iraq. With no one to greet him at the airport he sets out for the wild Northwest coast. His journey intersects with his distant father his step-mother a bitter veteran and the stewardess from his connection home. As each strays further from his everyday life and a body washes up on the beach their fates become bound inextricably together. A newfound sense of belonging is found and finally there is something to come back to; now the soldier has everything to lose.
