Daily half-hour series airing on the Noggin network aimed at preschool-age children and hosted by "Sesame Street" characters Ernie Bert Grover and Prairie Dawn. Each show was said to mimic a child's "playdate"; newly-created segments were interspersed with classic "Sesame Street" segments with the Muppet hosts encouraging the young viewers to participate. Children were also invited to send in their own drawings videos etc. that were featured on the show.
