Clementine lives with Ippolita an artist and is behind on her rent quitting job after job (or getting fired) and generally living a life without responsibilities. She meets Jo a young woman whose limited social life centers on caring for her aged father. Without telling Jo about Ippolita Clementine spends a lot of time with her and Jo falls in love. Meanwhile Ippolita and the landlord are both getting impatient with Clem: he for his rent she for affection responsiveness and some sign that Clementine is an adult. Will anything shake Clementine into honesty and responsibility?
