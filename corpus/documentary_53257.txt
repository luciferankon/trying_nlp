While many agree that Nostradamus predicted some of the most tumultuous and destructive events in history (including World War II and 9/11) there is a growing body of evidence that points to Nostradamus predicting the winner of this year's Presidential Election. Nostradamus consistently references an epic battle between a "Masculine Woman" who is also referred to as "the Queen" or "The Blonde One" and one who is a "great shameless audacious bawler." He also refers to a "rigged election" a term that has become a hallmark of the 2016 election. Now by breaking Nostradamus' code and searching for clues we can reveal that not only does he predict the outcome of this year's battle between Hillary Clinton and Donald Drumpf but he also foretells a time of great trouble in the wake of this historic election.
