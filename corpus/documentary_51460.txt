Twenty years ago Natalie Merchant recorded her first solo album - 'Tigerlily' - which sold five million copies and launched her post-10000 Maniacs career. In those two decades both she and the songs from 'Tigerlily' have matured. Last summer Natalie re-recorded the 11 songs and on November 6th they'll be released in a bonus package CD + DVD called 'Paradise Is There.' The accompanying film - 'Paradise Is There: The New Tigerlily Recordings' was produced by Oceans 8 Films. Natalie's entire musical life is encapsulated in this very personal film which digs deep into the music through live performances archival footage and interviews. Her fellow musicians friends and impassioned fans share how the songs of 'Tigerlily' have influenced them over the past 20 years and speak to how the power of music itself affects us in profound lasting and uplifting ways.
