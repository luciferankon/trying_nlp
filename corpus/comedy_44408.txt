A guy is sick and tired of losing every time he tries his luck at "100 Francs a second".He mistakes a young man Philippefor a fortune-teller and he asks him to have a go at the radio game. A game sponsored by a quinine tonic wine (supposed to pep you up)made by M.Bourdinet who fired Philippe who was more interested in his boss's daughter than in his work. After a forfeit (a bolster blow on the head)Philippe's got all the answers:historygeographysciencemusicsculptureliterature you name it;even algebra and quadratic Equations!(only an event can stop the game:a train coming into a station;but what a Lucky break:railroad men are on strike!) The game becomes a marathon the winner reaching millions of Francs threatening to ruin his former boss.
