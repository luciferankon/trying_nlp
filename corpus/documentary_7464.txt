Every year up to 50 million tons of electronic waste - computers television sets mobile phones household appliances - are discarded in the developed world. 75% of this waste disappears from the legal recycling circuits with much of it being dumped illegally in the Third World where it destroys landscapes and harms lives. This film takes the viewer on a journey of investigation to Europe China Africa and the US and reveals a toxic global trade fuelled by greed and corruption. On the outskirts of Accra Capital of Ghana the children occupy themselves with the dismantling and processing of discarded electronic equipment in an environment filled with foul stench and toxic fumes. Under those circumstances and in search of answers Mike Anane a journalist from Ghana sets out on a journey across Europe Asia and the United States of America. Straightaway he realises that even though there are thousands of recycling factories none of them operates at full capacity because almost three-quarters of the discarded electronics end up in the hands of international smuggling nets. It is without a single drop of doubt that this illegal business is flourishing right under our noses. Furthermore the fact that a staggering 10% of the world's resources of precious metals such as gold silver and copper goes to the electronic industries leads to the alarming conclusion that the world is rapidly depleting its resources. It seems that the world is fighting a lost battle against bureaucracy corruption and profit unless we as individuals understand that the consumer frenzy for newer and better devices will inevitably result in a planet crammed with toxic waste.
