This picturesque Ukrainian farm is not surrounded by fields but by huge housing developments. Ominous cranes overlook Natasha's land at the edge of Kiev which year after year is being pushed deeper into a pit by new panel buildings. The brave owner protects not only acres of land but also traditional family values faith and ownership. From a bird's-eye view of the farm a sharp contrast emerges between the village and the city. This peculiar family business model is set forth in a four-year chronicle from the point of view of foreign visitors who don't interfere with the way of life that the family has lived for generations.
