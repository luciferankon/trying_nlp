Six Easy Pieces is the last part of the Secrets Trilogy; a three-part cycle exploring the imperceptible conditions that frame life and is preceded by Secret Life 2008 (won the 2008 EMAF Festival Award at the European Media Art Festival Osnabrueck Germany) and Secret Machine 2009 (3rd Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art 2009 Russia) Reynold Reynolds deconstructs film as the perfect synthesis of art and technology and the process of capturing recording and bringing it back to life. The work connects art and science focusing on space and time and romantically refers to an age when artists and scientists had similar concerns and were often one and the same person as typified by Leonardo da Vinci. Philosophically and scientifically the concept of time has been extensively discussed and investigated for more than twenty-five centuries yet its real nature remains still unresolved; it has proven more mysterious and profound than life itself but where the scholar fails the artist dares tread.
