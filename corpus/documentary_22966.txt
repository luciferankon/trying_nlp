Fifteen apartments two routes through two - forgotten - neighborhoods of Athens two spectators. A documentary about a trans-medial group documentary performance by the Onassis Cultural Centre. We follow the audience and we converse with the curators the artists and the residents of the apartments searching for the boundaries between art and reality; private and public space; voyeurism and intimacy.
