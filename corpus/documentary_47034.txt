Documentary compilation of short films selected from the BBC Three talent search website Fresh online. Fresh online invited people to send in their films about what it's like to be young in the UK today. Over 300 films were uploaded covering a massive range of topics from dance music and sport to identity politics and mental health - with 90 films making it onto the website. Director Angela Russell has chosen clips from 50 of these and interviewed some of the film-makers to create a rich and inspiring picture of young Britain today.
