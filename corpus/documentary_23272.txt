The Art of Cornwall - Writer and lecturer James Fox tells the remarkable story of Cornwall's unique contribution to British art. For a period in the 20th century Cornwall was the home of the avant garde eclipsing London Paris and New York as a group of super-talented individuals sought refuge and inspiration in the West Country. From painter Kit Wood who brought the surrealist influences of Twenties Paris to Barbara Hepworth's Modernist sculptures James traces Cornwall's evolution to the hub of a new international art movement and explores its sudden fall after the mid-Sixties. The Art Of Cornwall also covers the work of artists Peter Lanyon Patrick Heron Terry Frost and sculptor Naum Gabo.
