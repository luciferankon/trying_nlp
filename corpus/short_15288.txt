Everybody collects something. Raymond "Bones" Bandar collects skulls - 7000 and counting. Shelf Life is a short documentary exploring one man's passion for collecting. Since his youth Raymond Bandar retired high school science teacher and long-time volunteer Field Associate for the California Academy of Sciences has been collecting bones of all kinds. Today Bandar has more than 7000 cataloged specimens tightly stored in his home - mostly skulls of marine mammals that he's personally salvaged for both scientific data and personal pleasure. His wife of 50 years artist Alkmene Bandar has only one rule: no skulls in the bedroom.
