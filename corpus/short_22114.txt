A girl plays her clay whistle and daydreams in a small garden. She is however alone. In the woods she stumbles upon a little tapir who then follows her home. You should never allow a strange tapir into your house though should you? Little Blue Tapir is an unusual love story in which the girl and the tapir turn to each other for acceptance. But you don't always find what you're looking for exactly where you think you will and some endings can make way for wiser beginnings.
