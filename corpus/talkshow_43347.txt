A popular late-night variety show in Japan. The format was similar to most talk/variety shows: interviews comedy skits movie reviews cooking segments and human interest news. The major difference of this show was that most of the hosts were adult video actresses who gave their reports wearing little or no clothing. Frequent news topics included specialty strip clubs lingerie fashion and new adult movie and magazine releases.
