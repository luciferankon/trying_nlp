A powerful documentary about the lives of teens and young adults as seen through the gender lens. Approaching society's ideas and ideals of gender through clothes sexuality sports dance safety consumerism and emotion the film addresses the complexities of conceptions of masculinity and femininity for Generation Z. With a fearless look at a highly charged subject Straightlaced unearths how popular pressures around gender and sexuality are confining American teens. Their stories reflect a diversity of experiences demonstrating how gender role expectations and homophobia are interwoven and illustrating the different ways that these expectations connect with culture race and class. From girls confronting media messages about culture and body image to boys who are sexually active just to prove they aren't gay this fascinating array of students opens up with brave intimate honesty about the toll that deeply held stereotypes and rigid gender policing have on all our lives. Filmed in the same intimate style as That's a Family! and Let's Get Real the heart of Straightlaced is candid interviews with more than 50 teens from diverse backgrounds. Straightlaced includes the perspectives of teens who self-identify as straight lesbian gay bisexual or questioning and represent all points of the gender spectrum. With courage and unexpected humor they open up their lives to the camera: choosing between "male" and "female" deodorant; deciding whether to go along with anti-gay taunts in the locker room; having the courage to take ballet; avoiding the restroom so they won't get beaten up; or mourning the suicide of a classmate. It quickly becomes clear that just about everything teens do requires thinking about gender and sexuality. Coming of age today has become increasingly complex and challenging; Straightlaced offers both teens and adults a way out of anxiety fear and violence and points the way toward a more inclusive empowering culture.
