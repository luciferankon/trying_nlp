Daphne Langley is desperate. With a recently laid-off husband and bill collectors banging down the door she takes a job as a French maid cleaning houses to make ends meet. One fateful day on the job she meets Dr. Lawrence Toland a widower and noted psychiatrist. Over a cup of tea he gives her workable marital advice. The advice repairs her marriage but does not solve her financial woes. Enter Hunter Clearvale an ex-lover who uses Daph's precarious financial position to coerce her in aiding in the robbery of a homebound autistic woman. When the robbery devolves into a double homicide Daph realizes the evidence will paint her as the murderer-- even though Hunter did the killing. Far from home she flees to the only place in the neighborhood she knows the home of Dr. Toland. When Toland discovers her hiding in a small recess in the basement wall he agrees to harbor her... so long as she agrees to turn herself in. After Toland discovers certain details about the murder he changes his tune encouraging Daph to stay in the room until the whole thing blows over. Insane with guilt and boredom Daph peels at the wallpaper and discovers a set of anagrams. When she deciphers them she discovers terrible secrets about Dr. Toland. The realization comes too late as Toland has already built a trap around Daph... and it will take everything she's got to escape...
