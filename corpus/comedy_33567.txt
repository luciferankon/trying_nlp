This is the final show played by female comedy duo Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders. It was performed on stage in front of a live audience. It contains re-enactments of some of their more popular skits as well as some original material which was written solely for the farewell tour. Two of the more memorable farewell tour skits include 'The basket of memories' which reputedly holds the props used during the series and Jennifer's self proclaimed elevation to the status of 'Comedy Goddess'.
