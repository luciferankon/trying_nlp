The Graduates explores the people and events that helped create the system of higher education which exists in British Columbia today. The film focuses on the stories of the competition between Victoria and Vancouver over the location of the first university the Great Trek of 1922: When students protested to force the government to build the University of British Columbia; the struggle for women's rights within the university; how a UBC professor saved the university from closing; how John Macdonald (a UBC president) fought to create the outstanding province-wide network of institutions of higher learning that BC has today; and challenges for the future.
