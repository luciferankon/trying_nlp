Beginning in 2011 the story of UNC's "fake classes" made national headlines as a massive athletics scandal. Caught between university deans unwilling to accept responsibility and news media eager to implicate athletics UNC's academic counselors for athletes found themselves accused of complicity and without the means to defend themselves. Bradley Bethel was a reading specialist for UNC athletes and was outraged by the way the press portrayed his colleagues. Refusing to remain silent he set out to defend those falsely accused and give them a platform to tell their side of the story. In the process he realized the problem was even bigger than the media. Following Bradley over the course of a year UNVERIFIED challenges the headlines and tells a story more complicated and heartbreaking than the one we've heard in the news.
