The CSA takes over from the police when a major defense contractor's CFO is murdered. According to the security video only the CEO whom he was going to denounce his 17-fold stupid fraud to the board entered yet he has a pretty convincing mayoral alibi. After a key witness is also murdered while he's in jail the only remaining possibility is a twin brother. Indeed he ignored being adopted by a wealthy couple which then felt too poor to take his brother too.
