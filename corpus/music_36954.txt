Stumbo Stomp amaPantsula is South Africa's richest Pantsula talent dance show and is all about getting to watch incredible Pantsula dancers perform amazing routines. Celebrating the talent of real Pantsulas and promoting the art of Pantsula in a stunning display of skill and athleticism. Every week 5 Contenders voted for by our Facebook fans compete in our ring. The competition bout is presided over by our judges "Queen of Dance" Chomee and celebrated Pantsula dancer and choreographer Buru who promptly K.O. our weakest Contenders. Our second segment brings in our resident choreographer Vusi to teach our remaining Contenders a new Pantsula dance piece. The Contenders once again face the judges who choose the week's Champion who wins the Stumbo Stomp amaPantsula Championship Belt and a sweet R25 000 every episode. The Champion returns the following week to face new Contenders and defend their title in the hopes of doubling and tripling their prize money.
