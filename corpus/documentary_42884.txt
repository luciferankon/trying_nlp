Today Mexican consumers have become more demanding about the food they buy prepare and eat daily. But not only consumers have become more demanding; the national and international markets today demand healthier safer and more quality food to producers. This has led many businessmen to make efforts to be competitive through so-called "best practices" throughout the production chain and through supervision and certification of their industrial processes. Among government agencies associated with this task the SENASICA (National Service for Food Sanity Safety and Quality) has the important mission to outreach producers and consumers to strengthen the new sanitary culture that Mexico needs.
