In 2009 inspired by the trends of reality television programming filmmaker Sam Pezzullo saw a glimpse of something in his group of friends. What he saw was an opportunity. An opportunity to capture dynamics characters and stories as they unfolded. Completely unfiltered and completely uncensored. An opportunity to paint a portrait of real friends and the experiences and memories they shared. Follow a group of friends whose every move over a 5 year period of time has been captured on a flip cam. The good the bad and the ugly. This docu-series breaks the mold of the typical "reality" television show. It's Friends meets America's Funniest Home Video's meets The Real World. It's the most authentic reality show ever produced because it wasn't "produced."
