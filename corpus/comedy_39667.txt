This special provides two great Andy Griffith episodes from December of 1960 and 1961 respectively: "Christmas Story" and "The Pickle Story." The first is about an old curmudgeon. But there may be more to his bad attitude than meets the eye. The second is about the home-made-pickle rivalry between Aunt Bee and her friend Clara. Andy's and Barney's "help" might not help as much as they hoped.
