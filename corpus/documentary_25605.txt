Extreme Ironing is the Chariots of Fire of household adventure sport. With stunning locations and beautifully turned out athletes the film follows the fortunes of "Starch" "Power Cord" "Iron Matron" and "Safety Setting" as they battle against the highly organised German and Austrian ironists. But hold on a minute. All is not well in the world of extreme ironing. A breakaway sect - Urban Housework - has rejected the sport in favour of radical vacuuming and organised an alternative championship sponsored by Electrolux. Will the world of white goods sport ever be the same again?
