Based on the Edgar A. Guest poem "Boywood" the scenes are in New England with three boys enacting the (then) activities of childhood. They wander through the woods over the fields and down to the old swimming hole. Norman Brokenshire narrates the poems and the activities while Al Shayne sings a special song written around the poem called "Down the Lane to Yesterday."
