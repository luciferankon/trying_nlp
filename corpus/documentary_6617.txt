America's divorce from the outdoors - and possibilities for reconnection through a dialogue between science and religion - are explored in this music-rich documentary. The 1960s environmental movement inspired young scientists like E.O. Wilson Cal DeWitt and Theo Colborn some of whom were raised within America's largest religious group: evangelicals. Today a new generation of scientist/evangelicals includes Katharine Hayhoe Ben Lowe and Corina Newsome. Can they revive the reach and relevance of America's evangelical and environmental movements? Grammy-award winning musician Dirk Powell leads arrangements of traditional American tunes along with Rhiannon Giddens and Tim Eriksen.
