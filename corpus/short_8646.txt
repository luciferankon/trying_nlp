A "new narrative" film based on the visions of magic realism in an Anglo context. This is a gothic mystery that explores a reckless pursuit of interchangeable personalities and experience. Whether experience is first hand read remembered from a conversation during a chance encounter heard of from all possible sources of information whether fact or fiction the "experiences" become ours; reinterpreted reconstructed and restructured finally becoming our personal myths and the source of our poetry and dreams. The sources for this film include night dreams the idea of holocaust the exoticness of the Mid-East the sensuality of animals the explorations of Scott in Antarctica and a film I once saw entitled The Son of Amir Is Dead.
