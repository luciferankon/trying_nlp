This program approaches the history of Jewish presence in Mexico: the origins of its institutionalization and structuring in the early decades of the 20th century as well as the major Jewish immigration that arrived here over the years 1924-1929. Through the voices of protagonists from that era as well as those of some of their descendants we recollect the story of the encounter between Jewish immigrants and Mexican society.
