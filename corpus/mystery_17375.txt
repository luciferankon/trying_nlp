Sabrina suddenly comes out of a deep coma she entered following a car crash. All damages seem to have been ironed out except for some short instants when her brain goes haywire: it seems as if reality splits and time rolls by abnormally. In such moments she perceives as if a door opened to suck her into another dimension to experience events apparently quite normal and once gone out of them only a deep sensation but not their conscience persisted since time apparently elapses backwards as if it canceled spans of life. Next to a specific experience within this space-time Sabrina brings back a fragment of it: like when a necklace snatched off by two crooks down the street is found inexplicably back at its place inside her jewel case as if it had never been carried away. Daniele her boyfriend witnessed the snatch. He stayed and still stays beside her also when she goes through these episodes of altered conscience. He works for a popular music magazine and when he is assigned a report on the Death SS a famed gothic metal band he asks Sabrina to join him. They are both going to follow closely the making of a video to be shot at Consonno a sinister ghost town built but never lived in. Subject of the video: a concert-meeting of the band guys with their fans. There Sabrina will discover unwillingly to have been selected for a unique experience: the Rebirth; yet to be allowed to live it she must be ready to cross the ultimate threshold.
