Dirt Music is about the sexually charged affair of a beautiful woman trapped in a coastal village as remote as the man she followed there. She risks everything for one more chance of love with a young musician silenced by dreadful personal tragedy. Her fight for love and survival plays out against the ruggedly beautiful landscape of Western Australia. And it's a fight to the last breath.
