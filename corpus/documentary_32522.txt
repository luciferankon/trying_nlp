For two generations Lorenzo's family has managed a mountain refuge in the Stelvio National Park at an altitude of over 2000 metres. Lorenzo has a dream namely to make his refuge autonomous in an ecologically sustainable manner so as not to affect the delicate equilibrium of nature. At the same time he dreams that the refuge can be linked to the world and that the people who live there need not abandon their life high in the mountains today at risk. The documentary recounts how Lorenzo is trying to achieve this dream.
