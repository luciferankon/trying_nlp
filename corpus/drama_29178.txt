Somewhere at the end of the world in a small village along the sea several men and women driven by the cruelty and the vanity of the civilization have found their temporary wharf. They meet here love jealousy betrayal devotion and mainly human goodness. Here they ascertain their own personality system of values and make their choices. The screenplay is written under Anton Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" motifs in the play but the story is developed here and now. The film inspires us to look with a smile and sympathy at the intellectuals around us who are unable to take life as a battle but who are able to stand for their values no matter of the price.
