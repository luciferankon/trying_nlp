Mr. Jack advertises for a Chambermaid and in response to the advertisement a pretty girl answers. She is employed at once. When she is in the pantry the butler makes love to her and in doing so they turn over a table on which are many dishes bowls etc. She gets angry at this and throws the butler out of the room. In the meantime a dwarf appears and by his mysterious power places together all the broken crockery. She thanks him and he disappears. We next see the girl bringing up tea for her employerwho subsequently makes love to her. While he is doing so his wig flies off his head. She runs out of the room. His wig in due time returns on his head. We next see the girl out in the yard washing clothes; the butler is trying to make love to her and she objects. The dwarf appears here again gives the butler and her employer who had just appeared a beating and then disappears. We next see them in the house. The maid is helping her employer put his coat on. He mysteriously disappears while she is doing so and in his place the little dwarf appears. He executes some phenomenal tricks and disappears. She is having too much trouble with her employer butler and the dwarf so she decides to leave.
