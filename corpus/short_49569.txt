When Tom Bowline went into the navy he was resolved to mount to the very top of the ladder and Tom was the sort of a boy to crystallize his dreams into actualities. He worked hard studied much went up through the various ratings in the enlisted stage until at last he attained his ambition a commission and an honored place on the quarter deck. Incidentally he also secured a dainty maid for a wife but ahem that's anticipating the story. The project to present Tom Bowline and his endeavors for a commission on the screen met with the warm approval of the United States Government and authority was given not only to use Government navy yards and vessels but officers and enlisted men wherever their services were necessary or desirable. It is a most unusual thing for such permission to be granted but this is a story of the navy by the navy and its scenes are correct in every detail. It was produced under the sanction of the Navy Department and in some of the incidents in the story several hundred men and officers are shown in naval tactics of all sorts. The film begins with Tom's application for enlistment and every stage of the process from this time on until he is a finished sailor is accurately depicted. He is shown with his mates practicing wigwagging on the bridge handling the great guns at hammock exercise going down in diver's armor and various other naval matters that have never hitherto been shown to the public. In the course of his work he meets a pretty girl under romantic circumstances saves her from drowning and when the commission he wins through earnest work at last comes to him he weds the girl and his happiness is complete.
