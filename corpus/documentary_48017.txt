This fascinating film is the biographical story of Senator Dudley "Coozan Dud" Le Blanc one unique man with three sides -- a major player in Louisiana politics for over 50 years the Founding Father of the Cajun Renaissance Movement and a marketer extraordinaire of the best-selling American patent medicine in the 1950's HADACOL. Coozan Dud's fame exploded when he marketed his patent medicine across the country on his HADACOL train filled with Hollywood stars comedians country music legends and famous athletes -- Mickey Rooney Bob Hope Judy Garland Lucille Ball Dorothy Lamour Jimmy Cagney Burns and Allen Groucho Hank Williams Minnie Pearl Carmen Miranda Jack Dempsey and many more. Groucho Marx invited Le Blanc on his TV show "You Bet Your Life" and asked "What is HADACOL good for?" To thunderous audience applause Dudley answered in his humble Cajun way "It was good for $5 million for me last year." Though he passed in 1971 Dudley "Coozan Dud" Le Blanc is truly a living legend.
