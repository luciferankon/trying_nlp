Follow the realistic life of four Mormon missionaries as they attempt to preach the gospel with the sensibility of nineteen year old 'Elders' as they tell dirty jokes goof off fantasize about women and of course preach the Mormon gospel. CALLED TO SERVE is a dramedy that examines the human condition through the juxtaposition of what it's like to explore one's faith or lack of faith and to still be human.
