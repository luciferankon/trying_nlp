In a small town everyone has tried to forget what happened shortly after WWII. That is until a stranger finds a book that Jadup (Kurt BÃ¶we) gave to the young refugee Boel (Katrin Knappe) who resettled in the town over 30 years ago. Painful memories about Boel and the post-war period begin to surface and shake up the whole town. Boel vanished back then and nobody knew why. Word spread about a rape and some tried to blame a Russian soldier. Jadup the town's respected and popular mayor remembers though how he mistrusted Boel and did not help her through this difficult time; HE didn't even notice THAT Boel loved him. Jadup's confrontation with the past gives him a new critical view of his current situation and surroundings. Originally censored and later banned by GDR officials for being too controversial Jadup and Boel was not released until 1988.
