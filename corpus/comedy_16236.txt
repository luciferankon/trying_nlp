He's a happy bear named Captain who only wants to have some fun. Now that he can fly aliens wolves and weasels are after him. Let the fun begin! Can Captain have a good time while trying to get his forest back to it's natural balance and avoid the forest war brewing? If the war happens aliens have sworn to delete the entire forest and all the critters in it. That's a lot for a young bear to handle. Hopefully he and his friends can come up with way to fix it all before it's too late. Too late I say. There's danger there's songs there's landclams there's JETBEAR.
