Spiritual Adviser Beyond Psychic ... Do you think people can tell you the future and about your past? In this show you will meet Master Chin who is a Buddhist Monk. Master Chin does not claim to be a psychic and makes it clear that he is a Spiritual Adviser. There are a couple things that stand out with Master Chin starting from the fact that there is no cost of his services but he does take donations to help support the Meditation Center. Also he only takes 60 people per day and in his sessions he can actually tell you names of people in your life events that will happen including the dates financial information and extreme details about your life in general. While watching this show you will see the testimonies of people who spoke with Master Chin and also have a chance to see what Master Chin says. Thank you for watching and be sure to follow the "Mayweather Live" show we keep it ALL THE WAY LIVE and touch on topics others won't. This show was filmed in Houston TX.
