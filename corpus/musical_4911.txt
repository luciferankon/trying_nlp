A live recording of the stage musical "Skanks in a One Horse Town" about three skanks from Studio 54 who - thanks to Steve Rubell's magical disco ball - travel back in time to the Old West where they must stop the local railroad baron from bringing the steam engine through the sleepy town of Deep Hole. Along for the ride are rocker Meat Loaf country singer Conway Twitty and noted bigot Anita Bryant.
