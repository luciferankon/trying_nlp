The stable seemingly happy lives of the Hammond family and their three very different grown-up daughters Prudence ('Amanda Redman' (qv)) Louise ('Alice Krige' (qv)) and Maddy ('Kelly Hunter (I)' (qv)) are suddenly shattered when Gordon ('Keith Barron (I)' (qv)) has a heart attack. Whilst recovering Gordon falls in love with his nurse April ('Adjoa Andoh' (qv)) and decides to leave Dorothy ('Sheila Hancock' (qv)) his wife of many years and move in with her. Initially the shock causes great consternation in the family but forces the exposure of many hidden secrets as Dorothy stays with each daughter in turn whilst trying to rebuild her life. Gradually all the Hammond's young and old must come to terms with their new lives and circumstances and face a future very different from anything they could have imagined.
