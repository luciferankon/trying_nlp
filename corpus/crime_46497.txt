Billy Ward's murders are directed by an inner voice he refers to as the 'Dark Passenger' which continually urge him to kill. Billy Ward's character is based on the fictional character Dexter found in Jeff Lindsay's novel; Darkly Dreaming Dexter. The catalyst for Billy's first killing comes in the form of an old Hitchcock movie which Billy views one night late on television. The scene which triggers his internal voice is of a women brutally strangled. It is this image which thrusts Billy into his killing zone and forces him to go out onto the streets of New York and take his first life. Undercover policewoman Jena Cole based on the Marvel comic character of the same name is working undercover on the streets of New York as a prostitute and drug user. It is she who ultimately finds herself becoming Billy's first victim.
