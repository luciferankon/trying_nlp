Marianne wants to become a dancer but her teacher considers her to be untalented. With the knowledge to have to orient herself elsewhere she tries to work on bending and breaking yet the career ladder; as a model a photo-model a film actress a stripper in a nightclub etc. The only career she does is a bed career. For this however she has all talents equal to three.
