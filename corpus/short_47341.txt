Even though Frode is only 7 years old he doesn't really believe in monsters. All that quickly changes when Frodes father is going out with his new girlfriend Mette who hates children. She gives Frode a small monster puppet which Frode throws in the closet in his bedroom. Later on when Frode is safely tucked in bed something is stirring in the closet because that little monster puppet is no ordinary puppet.
