A dying teacher instructs his final student to check on the activities of five former pupils each of whom he taught a unique and special style of kung-fu: Centipede Snake Scorpion Lizard and Toad (hence the title). His final student who knows a little of each style must team up with one of the other good students to destroy the evil ones if there are any. Greed and treachery ensue as the student discovers that some of the students are indeed evil but which one can he trust enough to team up with? A kung-fu student is instructed by his dying teacher to track down five of the teacher's ex-students. Each of the five is equipped with a lethal martial arts skill and the teacher fears this might be used for evil purposes. To make things more difficult for the student not only does the teacher not know the identity of the students (who all wore masks under his training) but some of the students also don't know each other! Chang Cheh's super-heroic grand guignol-flavored thriller proved hugely popular in America inspiring a U.S. soft drink commercial and even an entire rap music act's world tour. It also spawned a film series featuring more amazing high-flying blade-juggling flesh-stabbing mayhem.
