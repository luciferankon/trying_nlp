Like the Water follows Charlie a young journalist as she returns to her hometown of Camden Maine to write the eulogy for her best friend Katherine. Charlie's assignment unearths deep feelings of guilt at not having been a better friend which only fuel her long-standing resentment toward Katherine's girlfriend. On the eve of the memorial they are forced to confrontation and Charlie goes too far. She must learn to pick up the pieces when words are not enough. This project was co-written by Caitlin FitzGerald (It's Complicated Newlyweds Taking Woodstock) and Caroling von Kuhn the film's star and director respectively. It was produced shot and edited by a team of young women filmmakers on a micro-budget.
