It is summer 1944. The war is far away from Slovak mountains for the time being. The head of forest management Borodác ('Ladislav Chudík (I)' (qv)) brings a new employee to complete the eight woodcutters work team of Czechs Slovaks and one Pole - the young guy is Martin Uher ('Emil Horváth' (qv)) a former clerk form Prague. The eight tough men do not trust the newcomer at first but as time is passing they got used to him. After some time Martin gets next to Julika ('Anna Javorková' (qv)) a young wife of the gamekeeper Tkác ('Vlado Müller' (qv)) and they begin to go out secretly. The gamekeeper knows that Martin had promised to cooperate with German Gestapo after he had experienced a hard interrogation. In avoiding to be a grass Martin leaves Prague to hide in Slovak mountains. Tkác wants Martin to inform on his colleagues who hide guns in the forest to ready to use them against Nazis.
