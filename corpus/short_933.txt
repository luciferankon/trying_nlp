Heroin is an urban chic art film by New York City artist and filmmaker Marko Stout. The film lacks a clear narrative but rather follows a young woman's drug trip in real time delving into the dreamlike surreal hallucinations of the subject. "Heroin" never quite distinguishing between what is real and what is only imagined by the character.
