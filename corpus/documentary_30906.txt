A documentary that captures a single summer at Indian Head Camp a sleep away summer camp that has been operating in the Endless Mountains of Pennsylvania since 1940. Campers are removed from all cell phones and internet for seven weeks and are immersed in the natural world around them as they cultivate new friendships and foster the foundations of self-confidence and independence. Whether it be camping adventures in the wilderness or healthy competition and sport-it's all about camp.
