NARWHAL-AMERICAN is a cross-cultural love story centered on a fictional enclave community in contemporary Queens NYC. The film explores what it might be like for the 'discovered' and the 'discoverer' to find themselves at the cusp of a major discovery. Quirky but plausible Narwhal-American is grounded in cutting-edge genetics vibrant locations and the filmmakers' roots in documentary and anthropology. Narwhal-American features a diverse cast including extras recruited from the Queens and Washington Heights neighborhoods where we filmed.
