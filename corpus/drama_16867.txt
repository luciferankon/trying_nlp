From Publishers Weekly The devastating story of brothers Lafayette and Pharoah Rivers children of the Chicago ghetto is powerfully told here by Kotlowitz a Wall Street Journal reporter who first met the boys in 1985 when they were 10 and seven respectively. Their family includes a mother a frequently absent father an older brother and younger triplets. We witness the horrors of growing up in an ill-maintained housing project tyrannized by drug gangs and where murders and shootings frequently occur.
