Set in a small town where people spend their lives putting down their neighbor's religion a couple of close buddies who are Mormon missionaries go for what may be their last hurrah. Unable for the last five years to complete the standard two-year mission they are sent to the island of Puerto Rico with the same simple but unaccomplished goal: spread the faith. But as sometimes happens reality doesn't live up to expectations. Much too soon after arriving Mateus and Eliezer are markedly unwelcome are pursued into homelessness and then even robbed of the meager belongings they have left. Tired of this endless journey of theirs they decide to leave their mission behind and start to think about themselves their own wants and ambitions. Desperately broke Mateus and Eliezer somehow conclude that robbing the people of this town would be fair. They'll just steal some money and split. Their plan to burglarize an upper class neighborhood takes a wrong exit and chased by a howling pack of stray dogs they end up with a bag full of money belonging to Eliot the shadiest of characters. Eliot's daughter Paloma takes a liking to the Mormons whom she had met earlier at the hospital where she volunteers. Eliot's suspicions turn to the missionaries and the chase begins. Shot at and close to being caught a few times Mateus and Eliezer literally run for their lives. To spite her father Penelope becomes Mateus' and Eliezer's savior and helps them get out from Eliot's grip. With a bag of cash on hand Mateus Eliezer and Penelope fly to Brazil for the happiest of happy endings.
