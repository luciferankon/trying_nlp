Two radio comics go to Desert Springs one to get away from his jealous wife and the other to escape the attentions of a comedienne. The body of an agent is found in their room and later disappears. After some sleuthing by the actors and some other detectives changed just enough from well-known fiction-and-movie detectives to keep from being sued it is discovered that the agent was not killed but his body had been concealed by his doctor who had been experimenting with a new cure for heart trouble...none too well evidently.
