Between 1959 and 1960 an expedition was sent to the South Pole led by Frank Bastin and accompanied by film-maker Ludo Dilen who had a film crew from the Ministry of National Education at his disposal. Dillen's film Antarbel provides a chronological account of this enterprise and its scientific experimentation : the transfer to the King Baudouin base meteorological observations the study of snow or ice-crystals the measuring of the magnetic field etc.
