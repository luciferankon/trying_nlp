Working for O.S.I. the Office of Scientific Investigation A-Man agent Jeffrey Stewart and his partner Dan Forbes are sent to a local hardware store where they find a strong magnetic field has magnetized every metal item in the store. Investigating further they eventually trace the source of the magnetism to an airborn flight carrying scientist Howard Denker now dying of radiation poisoning who has carted on board with him a new radioactive element which he has bombarded with alpha particles for 200 hours. The element dubbed 'serranium' grows geometrically by creating matter out of energy which it absorbs from metallic objects surrounding it. Stewart calculates that if the substance is not destroyed soon that within 24 hours or so it will have grown large enough to throw Earth out of its orbit. With the discovery of atomic power the government has set up a special group the Office of Scientific Investigation or OSI to look into strange phenomena. Those who work there are known as A-Men (A as in Atom) and they are called in when a local appliance store owner finds that all of their products have become highly magnetized. The scientists are puzzled but their investigation leads them to a scientist who has invented a new element of tremendous power. Unless they can find a way to stop its growth it will destroy the Earth.
