Five children and six adults were killed and sixty-one homes were destroyed by the six-alarm blaze one of the largest in the city's history.

It is a graphic illustration of how prejudice intolerance and fear can lead to unthinkable acts of violence. A documentary that looks back to May 13 1985 - the day Philadelphia police exploded the home occupied by the radical group MOVE and the resulting fire that killed five children and six adults while destroying sixty-one homes in its wake.
