Yuu Shinozaki is fed up with living in his own words "according to the clock the clock that always turns right". He wants to lead life according to his own terms and not have to meet everyone's expectations. His liberal thinking gets him in bad terms with his parents teachers and childhood friend Aoi with only his biker sister Moe to understand him. One day after an exceptionally upsetting day at school Yuu jumps on his motorbike and leaves home to find a taste of a different way of life - to find a way to make the clock turn left.
