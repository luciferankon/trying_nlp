Beginning in the 1840s nearly 350000 people traveled west on the Oregon Trail in the largest voluntary human migration ever recorded. Many of these pioneers were women. In this program - produced in conjunction with the sesquicentennial celebration of the Oregon Trail crossing - author and historian LaRee Johnson reads from the journals of three courageous women - Lucy Ann Bailey Mary Esther West Riddle and Elizabeth Dixon Smith Geer - as they describe in their own words the joys and hardships of their journeys. Recorded in beautiful Pacific Northwest locations and featuring authentic period costumes this unique video provides a glimpse into the challenges faced by the pioneers as they settled the wilds of Oregon.
