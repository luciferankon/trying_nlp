When seduced under investigation a male prostitute tells the story of a brothel's madam who supposedly hires male strippers only if they "audition" first by giving her cunnilingus an act which mysteriously gets them hypnotized. They are then stuck in that strange hypnosis as slaves to her every whim because she refuses to proceed to a fully fledged intercourse. Two lusty female detectives investigate the madam's brothel until they manage to clear up the way for their lieutenant - and the madam's former lover - to enter the madam's office and seduce her with the notion of everything *but* cunnilingus before arresting her.
