Artist Cory Tr√©panier straps an easel to his back and steps into the Yukon wild for a month to explore Kluane National Park and Reserve's untamed beauty on canvas. Feel nature's awe in the largest non-polar ice field in the world as Cory comes face to face with Canada's highest peak: Mount Logan. Then it's an arduous hike on the Donjek Route canoeing on Mush and Bates Lakes and rafting down the Alsek River to the glacier-strewn Lowell Lake. This leads to the greatest challenge of the journey. Of the myriad of untamed landscapes that Cory encounters which will become the grand inspiration? Which view will fill a 9 foot wide canvas back in his studio and bring to life his experience in this dramatic land? TrueWild: Kluane is a cinematic journey through one of Canada's national treasures and an inspiring story of an artist's quest to fulfill his passion.
