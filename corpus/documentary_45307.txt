Santiago Files looks at president Salvador Allende's topple from Chile's unstable government and the players in his downfall: the CIA Chile's military and Allende himself. Much of the information leading up to Allende's downfall could not be verified but the CIA documents on Salvador Allende were released to the public in 2000. Santiago Files uses CIA documents; taped conversations with Richard Nixon; interview clips with former Director of the CIA Richard Helms; interview clips with Henry Kissinger; and interview clips with Salvador Allende to tell its story.
