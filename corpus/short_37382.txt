Embrace the new. But don't forget the old. Do we really care for the old? One fine day we all are going to get there. The short film talks about the need and urgency of an amalgamation of two or more different thought processes or worlds or communities or dimensions etc; necessary to prosper and have a content way of dwelling. "The Confluence" features two characters - The Youth and The Old Man. The Old Man is coming home from his day at work while The Youth is leaving home for his day at work. One is with some physical weakness climbing up the stairway. The other is full of energy fresh to take on a new day is walking down the stairway at his pace. The two cross each other's path in a poorly lit stairway. They do not interact but carry on with their respective journey. It is only when The Youth has reached at the bottom; the realization sinks in that he should help The Old Man. The Youth hence climbs up the stairway towards The Old Man and offers him help. The two then walk to the next level that is lit brightly. Here The Youth represents a new wave a new opportunity or a second chance that should be embraced and welcomed and should be seen as a fresh beginning. The Old Man represents experience an experience that should be learnt from to take upon new challenges.
