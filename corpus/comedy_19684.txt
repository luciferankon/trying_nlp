The Grape Dutches of York are a sketch comedy troupe based out of Astoria NY. The Dutches first came into existence back in 2008 when it was a small 5 man group with a passion to make stupid shorts. These 5 set out to make up sketches that they found inappropriate and funny. But with time jobs other projects and social obligations the group fell by the wayside. Only to be revived again in late 2011 as a larger troupe the newly re-formed Dutches were resurrected with some original members and added a great cast of characters. This incarnation of the Dutches has the same goal: to make sketches that they find funny off-centered and slightly edgy.
