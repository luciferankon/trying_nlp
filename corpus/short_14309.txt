Once Rodolfo's mother told him of the existence of an 8mm tape in which she was dancing The Beatles with his father. The year was 1963 and they were ten years old. Rolo his grandfather had recorded the tape. That film turned out to be in a box full of super 8 tapes whit hours of home movies that for decades did not see the light. This material was digitized and projected to the family. Divine Treasure is the testimony of that experience the recording of emotions and an inquiry about time.
