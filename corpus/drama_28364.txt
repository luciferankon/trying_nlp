When Michael Dvorak leaves his native Germany in 1990 to immigrate to the United States he embarks on an odyssey of self-discovery. Trying to find a job in a recession-plagued economy proves to be the least of his worries. Apprehensive about his attraction to his best friend and roommate Steve Michael seeks refuge from his confusion in the arms of beautiful Julia Hencock a model with a dubious part-time job-and an even more obscure past. Julia has her own problems. Her precarious romance with Michael soon turns into a balancing act: she must satisfy both a boyfriend-whose true sexual proclivities she suspects-as well as her nightly clients while evading a killer who knows that her testimony could land him in the electric chair. And sensing Steve's jealousy of her attachment to Michael she fears that Steve might betray her ultimate secret. Both Michael and Julia must eventually conquer their respective demons. But when Michael finally submits to his infatuation with Steve will it be too late? And after Julia's path crosses that of the killer for the last time her life-and Michael's-will never again be the same.
