The Mailroom is an ensemble comedy series about the inner workings of a Hollywood talent agency - and what it's like to be a clueless but ambitious 20-something trying to figure out your place in the world. In the pilot abusive vitriolic talent agent Blaise Falkin fires yet another assistant and must search for a replacement among the available staffers in the mailroom: Kevin the latest hire straight out of film school and greener than St. Patty's Day at an Irish Pub; Jane the perfectionist-to-a-fault; Freddy the most senior mailroom staffer (to the point of senioritis); and Gerry a socially inept fanboy. Each staffer has to choose whether to throw or to give everything they've got--to the interview that could potentially alter the rest of their careers.
