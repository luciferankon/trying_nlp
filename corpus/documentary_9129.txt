Nir Malchi is a world leading Tai-Chi master born on a Kibbutz but turned to Judaism to become an ultra-orthodox Jew and is now fighting a battle against cancer. It's been three years since his doctor declared he has only a few months to live. As the film progresses Nir's relationship with his first-born son Gal is revealed. 28-year-old Gal is the fruit of a youthful affair. Nir met his son only once or twice and the young child learned of his father's fame from newspaper clippings. After the army Gal himself began training in martial arts and their ways crossed again. This touching union is the emotional center of the film as Nir's health deteriorates and improves periodically forcing the viewer to rethink the traditional definitions of Eastern and Western medicine practices and philosophies.
