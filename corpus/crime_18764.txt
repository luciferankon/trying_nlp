A man is living his boring life as a writer and husband with a wife less than entertaining. He's left to fall to the demise of a psycho 22 year old female fan with a mental breakdown. He doesn't see that his illusion of total bliss is actually a life altering chance that might just get him dead. 22 is not just her age but a catch that enters him into the bind of his life. He's damned anyway you look at it but his goal is not to get dead!
