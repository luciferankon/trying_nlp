A single shot in close-up of moving dishes on a circular conveyor belt in a sushi bar in a London station. In the middle-ground servers prepare the sushi while passengers can be seen hurrying to catch their trains in the background. The title was suggested by "Brief Encounter" by Lean and "Close Encounters" by Spielberg. In "Brief Encounter" two married people meet by accident in a railway station restaurant fall in love and begin an ultimately doomed relationship. In this video the station restaurant has been transformed into a sushi bar but it could still serve as a trysting place. The Spielberg reference is due to the fact that the dishes are reminiscent of flying saucers. "Encounter" also refers to the globalization of culture represented by a Japanese sushi bar in an English station. The circular movement of the food is analogous to the journeys of the passengers. In the far background a curved station window can be glimpsed that echoes the shape of the bowls.
