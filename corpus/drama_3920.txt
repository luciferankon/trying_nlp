Inner city boys Jonathan Danny Tony and Mike met in Juvenile Hall. Twenty years later their love and loyalty for each other is as powerful as the High Risk Behaviors (HRB) they share and can't resist. Though brotherhood provides some emotional stability and happiness it also constantly threatens their very existence because their addictions feed each other. Luckily these guys have enough of a conscious to channel their addictions in Robin Hood like fashion.
