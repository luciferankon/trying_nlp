Houda al-Habash a conservative Muslim preacher founded a Qur'an school for girls in Damascus Syria when she was just 17 years old. Every summer her female students immerse themselves in a rigorous study of Islam in addition to their secular schooling. A surprising cultural shift is underway-women are claiming space within the mosque a place historically dominated by men. Challenging tradition Houda insists education for women is a form of worship. Using Qur'anic teachings she encourages her students to pursue higher education jobs and public lives while remaining committed to an interpretation of Islam prioritizing women's role as wives and mothers. In a world rarely seen The Light In Her Eyes tells the story of a leader who challenges the women of her community to live according to Islam without giving up their dreams. Shot right before the uprising in Syria erupted the film is an exclusive look at a social movement thriving in a country controlled by a repressive regime.
