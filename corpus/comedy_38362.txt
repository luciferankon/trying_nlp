Heaven knows it's not the way it should be but for downtrodden disco diva Belle Adonna income from "Air BnB-ing" her home in a sketchy East Hollywood neighborhood has miraculously kept the lights on. From the entitled to the criminal to the merely deranged each of Belle's guests brings a new note of madness to the dance mix at her heavily mortgaged duplex. Even the worst review from Belle's diva days seems like a love note compared to merciless yelping from unhappy visitors. With her fate totally in the hands of her guests Belle is starting to fray from the strain of living with the knowledge that an overlooked pube on the bowl could be the short curly nail in her coffin. Belle's humbling remix gets an extra crazy spin when her elderly father Howard Sanchez arrives on her doorstep with bags in hand. Belle's most treasured souvenir from the disco era is super-fan Oliver Newman. From gay teen runaway who snuck onto Belle's tour-bus to founding groupie of the Belle-Bottoms Oliver is now Belle-wrangler in chief-and the rock that keeps Belle from rolling off the rails.
