She may look like the girl next door but hot and hysterical Vickie Shaw has a wicked wisecrack to just about everything. Riffing on the madness of menopause to helping your kids come out about your sexuality Vickie says that when your kid's friends ask "Is your mom gay?" look 'em in the eye and ask "Why? - Does your mom wanna date her?" And when someone wants to know "What is it that you girls do?" Just shoot 'em a razor-sharp comeback and offer them a visual aid! Wowing audiences across the country the voluptuous and vivacious Vickie Shaw now slays them at another Southern California sold-out show filmed live in Long Beach's hotspot venue Vault 360. "You Can Take the Girl Outta Texas..." is one of All Out Film's funniest contributions to lesbian comedy yet. With clever commentary on stroller gridlock during Provincetown's Gay Family week to what it's like being a recovering "SOB" - Southern Baptist - Vickie's delicious down home humor is off-the-charts outrageous and out of this world!
