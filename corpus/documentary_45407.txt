Virtual Wuhan is a virtual reality experience for HTC Vive created on location in the Central China's Hubei Province. Using photogrammetry pointcloud technology the project documents the rapidly changing city of Wuhan. In April of 2016 artist John Craig Freeman was selected by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to participate in the ZERO1 American Arts Incubator. While there Freeman worked with local communities to document those parts of the city that best represented their experience of change. Virtual Wuhan includes 10 chapters with 30 individual scenes.
