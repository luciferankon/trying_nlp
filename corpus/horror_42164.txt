In Kentucky five sexy students are trapped to spend the night in an abandoned sanatorium where many people were killed in the 30's when the location was devastated by an infectious white plague as a prank of their school mates. Along the night while trying to escape from the asylum they are haunted by ghosts and the survivors disclose that they are descendant of the victims and are reviving their deaths. The movie is based on the True Stories and Hauntings of Waverly Hills Sanatorium in Louisville Kentucky. This horrific five story structure is listed as one of the Top Ten Scariest Places on Earth due to the 63000+ deaths within this monument of terror. The deceased were then carried through the massive five hundred foot underground tunnel to their final resting place. The story involves five girls on a college initiation forced to spend the night separately on the five floors of this sanatorium with the five ghosts that exist within its abandoned corridors.
