An auto-mechanized directive for mapping a microcosmic landscape. Using cut-glass filters on a broken VHS camera I traverse the terrain of a vintage pinball machine using mechanical movements reminiscent of Michael Snow's La Region Centrale. (Dedicated to Mark Loeser Justin Evans and Michael Snow). A special commission for Graphical Recordings with selected moving-image artists responding to POEM (1957) by Michael Snow.
