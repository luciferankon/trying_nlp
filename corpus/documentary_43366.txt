The United States has become more polarized than ever. We see Black Lives Matter vs. Blue Lives Matter on our news stations and social media feeds. In Orlando FL one community program is making a difference. The first of its kind in the country Dueling Dragons matches inner-city at-risk teens along with officers from the Orlando Police Department. Each week they come together in a Dragon Boat to slash stereotypes and break down barriers. Success in dragon boating comes only when all 20 paddlers are in complete synchronicity. The mission of Dueling Dragons is to use this ancient sport to build trust and long-term mentoring relationships at a critical time in the lives of both cops and kids in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods. The program addresses gang prevention racism profiling and respect.
