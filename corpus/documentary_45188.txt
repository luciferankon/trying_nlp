Tree of Tongues in Tripura is triggered conceived and realized at a film-making workshop at the Tripura University at Agartala on two tribal musicians of Tripura named Saudagar and ThangaDarlong. Music is there in the wind of Tripura. Stories are there in the breath of that wind. This film is about that very urge of human imagination-STORY TELLING. Whenever the narrative gets into a crisis either of the musiciansturn-by-turnbreath in music. At times storms happen. Wind runs out of the storm. In a Biblical fashion the design wonders about the designer. This film too is an adventure in film-making.
