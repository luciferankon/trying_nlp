After nearly 50 years of eye-poking and face-slapping the Stooges decide to retire and tour the world with their dog Moose. They start by touring America's national parks however with the stooges it is truly a "kook's tour". This especially proves to be the case for Larry who despite his best efforts simply cannot seem to catch a fish. Larry is driven to the height of frustration as he is continually outfished by Moe Joe Moose and even his own hat!
