You've got Sherm. A normal teenage boy. A typical adolescent just trying to get through the day. As if dealing with all the troubling teenage anxieties insecurities and urges is not enough Sherm's got one more problem. He's also got... Germs. Thanks to a laboratory experiment gone awry Sherm's Germs have become his live-in self-appointed best friends... Five non-infectious Germs. Slimy. Gelatinous. Inappropriate. Clueless. Opinionated. Flatulent; these Germs have removed the word "normal" from Sherm's vocabulary.
