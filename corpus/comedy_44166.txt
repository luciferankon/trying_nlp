International news giant WNC wants to get the U.S. president re-elected for the third term by creating fake "Crazy Guru" story about the fictional Japanese wacko who plans to drop nuclear weapons on half the planet in days. That fictional Guru is set to make his announcement in the African town of Katango and WNC sends their naive Paris correspondent Michael Kael there to cover the story.
