At the outset of 2008 Marco Benevento set up shop at New York City's Greenwich Village music space Sullivan Hall for a month-long residency. Calling it home for five Thursday nights in January Benevento invited a who's who in modern jazz and improvisational rock music to perform with him each week in various configurations. Each night he'd lead his musical co-conspirators through two sets of consistently breathtaking improvisations.
