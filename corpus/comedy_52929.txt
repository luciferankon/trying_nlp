Live in 5 is a farcical series about the off-air hi-jinks of the local news team at WIPU. With free Parmesan spinach dip from the downtown Applebees hanging on the line there's no limit to what these characters will do to achieve local celebrity status! The only thing hard hitting about this news team is some occasional hair pulling as they all fight their way to the top. Watch as it unfolds in WIPU's break room from the perspective of a hidden camera in one of the studio monitors.
