This film was inspired by how our post-modern generation is slowly being stripped of the need for this "nine-to-five" life with the opportunities that new technologies and innovations create. Garcia poses how breaking free from this cycle is a good thing and allows for more personal exploration and creativity. She parallels this idea with the notion of love and how it has evolved as a response to these new creations that surround our world. This film was a collaboration with people from all parts of the sexual spectrum and Garcia wishes to show the world that choosing our mates should be approached with the same creativity and open-mindedness as how we choose our livelihood.
