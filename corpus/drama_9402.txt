Meena Murray voice actor on the hit Saturday morning kid's TV show 'Moonlight Flip' wants it all everything she can take. Pulled into Hollywood's electric intensity it doesn't just end in front of the camera. The boozing the schmoozing the late nights. Everything becomes a high-speed neon waltzer of excess as it spirals out of control. Meena trying to escape everything she has created goes on the run from the person she has become. Facing ghosts from her past as her life explodes into fragments so big it may take two people to live it.
