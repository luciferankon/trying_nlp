Minne is a very imaginative young lady. She pretends to have had lovers and can't think of anything better to do other than... to tell Antoine her husband the day she marries him. Bad beginning for the couple... As the marriage is not consummated for years Minne feels frustrated and tries to find elsewhere the carnal knowledge she does not find at home. But Antoine is a kind-hearted man and on the occasion of a trip a sexual balance is at last found between the two partners.
