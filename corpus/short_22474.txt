Through sound and motion "aki no tawamure" (autumn playfulness) explores and celebrates our unconscious connections with our natural environment providing us with moments for our own inner reflection. We hear the rustling sounds of the leaves as we wander through the wet autumn leaves shimmering in the long Northern light. The colors are soft and warm. The sounds are celebrating and inviting. It's moment of unconscious playfulness.
