On the Road to Cleveland is a documentary project that follows the development preparation and subsequent carrying out of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland OH.The point of this film is not only to follow the journey of the RNC but also to study the socio-economic impact of a major political event on an area. For example: how different are the local attitudes toward a political event versus a sporting event? Every time a major event rolls into a new city with it comes visibility for the host city and a large influx of money into various local industries. However it also presents a wide array of planning difficulties and inconveniences for locals. This is true with every major event.
