Poor Rick. He just saw his neighbor killed by a hit-and-run driver and he's got it in his head that he has to move on to the next stage of his life before it's too late. To Rick that means marriage and a family but when you don't even have a girlfriend your social circle consists mainly of the people you work with and they're all nuts what's a guy to do?
