The movie 'Saayad' is the story of two brothers Yodin (played by Samyam Puri) and Nirag (played by Sunil Rawal). After Yodin was born their family had earned wealth and their life became more easier so Nirag considers Yodin a luck. Yodin's crush Sirish was the sister of Nirag's crush Samridhi. Yodin's best friend Ved (played by Wilson Bikram Rai) introduced Yodin to drugs. Yodin and Ved's group started taking drugs because of the problems in the family and love lives. Drugs caused them to neglect their study and get involved in gang fights. The story takes a u-turn when Sirish died. It is better to keep from telling all about how Sirish died and how their lives changed after her death not to spoil your movie experience in the theatre.
