The historic clock of a small town needs to be repaired but there is no money in the town coffers to pay for it. Don Paolo (Peppino Spadaro) the Priest raises the money by lottery and thinks the surplus should go to the poor. The Communists and Socialists object because they are afraid the priest will get the credit and they claim it as "the people's money." The democratic mayor (Arturo Brogaglia) can think of no solution other than organizing committees and sub-committees. Finally Rocchetti (Paola Stoppi) the town mechanic who has no answers for town problems and hates the clergy and politicians alike comes forward and repairs the clock for the sheer joy of work.
