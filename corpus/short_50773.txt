Shocking picture from the heart of Eastern Ukraine. Remains of European culture in the dark industrial metropolis of Donetsk. Smoke pollution stray dogs endless lines of broken down block of flats. Alesia a five year old girl growing up in love and hope in the warm family nest. Suddenly arrives the day when she has to face reality.
