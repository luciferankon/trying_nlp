Tempo is a film about sound and music. The only dialogue in the film is the word "stop". Timing is everything they say. Here's a little film about the great art of shifting into the right tempo at the right time. It's also about finding the music in everything you do. A man is on his way to a very important appointment. He is in a hurry but he is delayed by so many obstacles as he crosses town that an ordinary man would have collapsed with serious symptoms of stress ages ago. Where is he going? Will he make it on time?
