Starring Johnny Sanchez (Mad TV) Carlos Alazraqui (Reno 911) and Al Madigal (Free Agents) the three perform Stand-Up Comedy for the Spanish Impaired. Of course that's easy for these three veterans of comedy since their first language is English. Filmed at the El Portal Theater the 3 Non Juans talk about the joys and perils of living in a Spanish speaking culture without speaking a word of Spanish and making a living doing it in a not so brown world all stereo types welcome. This show is definitely for the Spanish Impaired...IT'S IN ENGLISH PEOPLE!
