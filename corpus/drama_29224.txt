Michael and Debbie are students in a method acting class that demands that its students connect immediately and truthfully to their emotions and to each other. They both fail miserably. As we follow them beyond the classroom we see how their failures in the repetition exercise are reflected and repeated in their lives in which they perpetuate their inability to connect through repetitive coping mechanisms. Laura and David while not acting students are equally incapable of connection; Laura avoids people and her emotions by eating compulsively; David copes by descending into a comic book fantasy world. When a traumatic incident brings these four face to face with one another they are each forced to confront their deepest fears of people and themselves and risk pain and humiliation to break through their barriers of loneliness and isolation.
