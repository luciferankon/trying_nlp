Leonard is alone obviously for a long time. After all maybe she will not come. For now only one thing is certain he's there alone facing himself. So what does he really expect? Is he just waiting for this young woman whom he does't know but hopes to approach? Or would he not rather wait for the materialization of a desire formatted by the social networks that he's being made by thinking about her?
