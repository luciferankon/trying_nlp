The three parts of the documentary are connected by the scenery of the Boka Kotorsk√° bay and the human will on a mountain trail. Three men hike along the narrow paths on steep slopes above the coastline. The camera follows their steps and without words or music the film asks about the purpose of their walk. A man's paces are counted by the tower clockwork. In the Watchman episode the second man descends to the coast to night-watch a bankrupt factory. In Smoke the third man sets fire to the last inhabited house in a mountain village.
