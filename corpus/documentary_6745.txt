A loving daughter documents her reunion with her mentally-unstable mother in this heartfelt and decidedly personal documentary from filmmaker Tara Wray. When Wray was just a child her mother was her entire life. A young girl with no father figure to speak of Wray and her mother became so close that it was nearly impossible to distinguish where daughter ended and mother began. It was during those years as the pair did their best to elude demons both real and imagined that Wray first began to see signs of the powerful psychosis that would gradually cloud her mother's mind to the point of total insanity. After loving and protecting her increasingly unstable mother to the best of her abilities Wray left home at the age of nineteen - when her mother threatened to kill her. Now five years after that fateful threat Wray returns to Manhattan Kansas to re-establish her bond with her mentally disturbed mother and perhaps help the ailing abstract artist locate the geographic center of the United States - a curious location that just may hold the secret to establishing world peace.
