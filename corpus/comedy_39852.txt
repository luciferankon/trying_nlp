Flame-haired Rebekah Brooks hitch-hikes from Warrington to London where media tycoon Rupert Murdoch immediately makes her CEO of tabloid paper The Sun edited by Andy Coulson - affording her absolute power. As such there are no depths to which she will not sink to publish scurrilous exposes of the famous whilst at the same time politician David Cameron crawls to Murdoch and his ferocious wife Wendi to be made prime minister. When Buckingham Palace complains about phone tapping Coulson finds a scapegoat - to the outrage of Guardian editor Alan Rusberger. Key muck-raker is the shabby Johnny Bristol but after Coulson goes too far causing a suicide he turns whistle blower on the Sun's phone tapping exploits. The red top is now under threat but  hey this is the 70s after all (yes!) and whoever else she sacrifices be it Rusberger Coulson or actor husband Ross Kemp Rebekah knows that she Will Survive.
