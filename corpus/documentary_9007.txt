There was a time when running a sub 4-minute mile was considered the holy grail of sports. The public fascination and global preoccupation with the event ended in May 1954 when Englishman Roger Bannister broke the elusive barrier which was believed to be beyond the limits of the human heart. Another barrier considered beyond man's limits; was broken in February 1994 when Irish track legend Eamonn Coghlan became the first person over 40 years old to run a sub 4- minute mile. On October 26 2006 Patrick Clarke an out of shape 39-year-old with no background in running set out on a year-long quest to become the second man to break the magical barrier. Throughout this enthralling and personal journey The Extra Mile pays tribute to the extraordinary innovators of the mile and to the millions of unlikely heroes who go beyond their limits in the wonderful sport of running.
