Four women. One estate. Countless secrets. When four writers -- an essayist a poet a playwright and a film-maker -- are granted access to the exclusive Silent Manor visions of best-sellers glint in everyone's eyes. Paige Alice Reese and Veronica begin as strangers but quickly become something else as their lives clash collide and intertwine. What is the truth of Silent Manor and its dark history? Who are the children in the shadows or the man and woman in the halls? Does the groundskeeper hold more secrets than the four writers who seek inspiration? The women have just two nights to find their voices or hear the voices whispering to them - or stay silent forever.
