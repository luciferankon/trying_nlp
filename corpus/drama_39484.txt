1862 present day Kagoshima Japan. A lone upstart sweet potato farmer named Nakamura Hanjiro (played by Tataaki Enoki) seeks an audience with the Satsuma Domain military Commander Saigo Takamori to present him with the gift of sweet potatoes. His ulterior motive was to be given the opportunity to demonstrate his sword skills in hopes that he could be made a Samurai. Impressed Saigo grants his wish and sends him to Kyoto to join other Satsuma Samurai in their quest to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate. Nakamura quickly distinguishes himself with his lethal sword skills defeating scores of pro-Shogunate Shinsengumi forces and ultimately rises to the rank of general in the new Japanese Imperial Army. But years following the end of the Boshin War that toppled the Tokugawa Shogunate Saigo Takamori is unhappy with the policies of New Meiji Government. Saigo resigns his post as military commander and returns to Satsuma. Philosophically united Nakamura Hanjiro joins with other officers and resigns from the army to go join Saigo Takamori in what would become The Satsuma Rebellion. This is the real story of Nakamura Hanjiro and the real Last Samurai of Japan.
