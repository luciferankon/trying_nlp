Absurd sketch comedy blends with the ongoing story of a fledgling local therapy group. Led by an unlicensed self-proclaimed therapist the FreeLoveForum meets every week to offer troubled souls an opportunity for grievance confession and free coffee. Characters from vastly different worlds convene in a rented room to share the common bond of their anxiety whether it's the death of their beloved horse or their addiction to wax bottle candy. Sketches are woven throughout employing a unique new format that links narrative with sketch.
