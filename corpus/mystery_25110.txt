Legend has it that two demons were jailed in the Calabash Mountains one a Scorpion spirit and the other a Snake spirit. One day a pangolin happens to drill a hole on the slope and the two spirits escape from the cave causing grave harm to the nearby residents. The pangolin hurries to an old man and says that only by growing calabashes in seven colors can they annihilate the spirits. So the old man spares no time in growing seven calabashes each a different color of the rainbow: red orange yellow green cyan blue and purple. The calabashes ripen sequentially falling off their stems to the ground and transforming into seven boys. Each has a unique supernatural ability such as super-strength enhanced hearing and sight invisibility and pyrokinesis as well as a weakness. Each of them also have above average strength and speed given that all of them have shown the ability to lift items several times their own weight and leap several metres. With a combined effort they set on a mission to defeat the demons. Upon defeating the demons the seven brothers seal themselves together into a mountain with all the colours of the rainbow ready to awaken to fight evil should it ever arise again.
