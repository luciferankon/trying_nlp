Ajay Kumar had written-off his life; his future; his faith in himself and others. Since his diagnosis of cancer his own mortality clung to him like a stone pulling him into an early grave. If only he had more time he would do things differently. Receiving the news of his remission he sets out to right some personal wrongs but in doing so he alienates those who were also there for him during his time of suffering. He climbs aboard his motorcycle and sets out to find answers; answers to questions that relentlessly haunted him while facing his own death. He must embark upon a perilous journey of personal rediscovery. A journey just as perilous as the cancer he once faced. It is a reckoning; a settling of his accounts with his wife his creator and himself.
