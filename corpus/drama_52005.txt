DC Lenny Milton is not as ambitious as his best friend and popular boss DCI Michael Love but the pair are drinking partners and their wives and children are close. However this goes very wrong over the space of 7 days when Milton is approached by the police complaints division asking him to go undercover and investigate allegations of corruption against his friend. Milton finds this difficult at first and tries to dismiss the evidence building up. But as his suspicions begin to take shape his position appears to be in danger.
