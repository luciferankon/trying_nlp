This 100-year celebration has rare footage of Red Sox southpaw Babe Ruth Jimmie Foxx and Lefty Grove. This superb documentary bridges the gap to Ted Williams whose hitting heroics are captured in living color along with the history of Fenway Park itself from Opening Day 1912 through the Impossible Dream season of 1967.
