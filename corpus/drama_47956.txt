Vishwanath Prasad is an Indian Administrative Service officer and lives in Bombay with his wife Kunti and a daughter Sanaa. One night when he returns home his wife tells him that she has been sexually assaulted and names the culprit as one Bunty. Vishwanath is angered at this outrage and speaks to a senior police officer who initially offers all help to prosecute Bunty. But when the senior police officer finds out that Bunty is really Narendra Verma the daughter of Home Minster Rameshwari he backs off and tells Vishwanath he cannot do anything. Vishwanath then goes to the nearest police station to lodge a F.I.R. (First Information Report) however Police Inspector Brij Bhushan refuses to write it. When the Governor refuses to meet with him he telephones the State Chief Minister Chandramohan who invites him to his house the very next day. The next at the Chief Minister's residence he finds Rameshwari and Bunty also present there. Chandramohan asks Bunty to apologize but Vishwanath is not satisfied as he wants Bunty to be criminally prosecuted. Then Bunty's goons take over and start terrorizing Vishwanath and his family. Frustrated Vishwanath kills himself. His suicide case is turned over to the Central Bureau of Investigation and assigned to Officers Pradhan and Abhimanyu Singh. Shortly thereafter Bunty and Rameshwari are arrested charged and the matter is brought to court. The court dismisses the case and Bunty & his mom are set free. Subsequently Abhimanyu's girlfriend Reena gets more evidence the case is re-opened and a warrant issued for Bunty's & his mom's arrest. It is here that the young and naive Abhimanyu will find how hard it is for justice to prevail especially when the suspect is the son of an influential Home Minister and that politics does rule above everything else.
