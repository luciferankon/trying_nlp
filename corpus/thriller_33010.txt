To his neighbours and workmates Max Greif is just another suburban misfit a private man who shuns the world for the occasional solace of the bush. But If they knew what he did out there... Saw the shallow graves of his victims. The blood on his hands. They wouldn't be so quick to judge. But they can never know. No-one can see what he really is and live to tell. Max Grief is the ROADMAN. To Lorraine Jackson he's the shy working man across the street she dreams of one day sharing a life with a life far from the tedium of caring for her bed-ridden father. But she's never told him that. She's never spoken a word to him. That is until a sabotaged water pipe thrusts them together. Lorraine's tenderness and loving nature is something Max has never known. He allows himself to hope to believe in the possibly that love can free him from his demons. But haunted by the memory of his sadistic father and racked by self loathing he is soon back on the road looking for his next kill. As his love deepens for Lorraine so does his madness. How long can he hide his dark soul from Lorraine? How far can he let her into his life before she stares into the abyss. And when she does... Can he let her live?
