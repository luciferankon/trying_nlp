Are sharks really out to get us? Are these predators mindless man eaters demonized by the popular media and movies like "Jaws"? That's the driving question behind this high-adrenaline two-hour live National Geographic event. Shark Attack Experiment: LIVE! will beam from the world's most shark-infested location off the coast of South Africa. Here a team of free-diving shark junkies and conservationists put their own safety on the line to run a series of hi-tech tests to separate shark attack myths from realities. Also on location during Shark Attack Experiment: LIVE! are shark attack survivors willing to tell their stories and enter the water some for the first time since their traumatic encounters. Their objective is no stunt; their goal is to raise public awareness that the world's shark species are being destroyed by over-fishing.
