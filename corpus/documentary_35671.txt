Teams dash across Hungary Austria the Mediterranean coast of Italy France and Spain before boarding a ferry to Morocco. In Morocco they enjoy the warmth of Saharan hospitality discover that camel makes an excellent kebab and meet refugees from a country that most people never even heard of. The third leg of the rally starts with a hair raising drive through a mine-strewn "no-man's" land before Mauritania. After crossing the great desert teams find out that the last hurdles are the most forbidding. As they race across the vast savannah disaster strikes. But after two weeks of grueling and sometimes neck-breaking travel they reach the bustling capital of Mali.
