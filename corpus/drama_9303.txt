While in their car behind a red light at an intersection an argument causes Bahman to pick up a nasty attitude toward a working child and in result later on the child gets sandwiched between two cars in a crash and dies. On one hand Bahman's fault for the death of the working child is inevitable and on the other hand Tara wants to bring in and takes care of the 12 year old sister of the dead boy in order to clear her guilty conscience. This makes the situation and their marriage more fragile and complicated.
