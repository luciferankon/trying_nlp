When his father dies Amal a six-year-old Indian boy becomes an orphan and moves to another region of India to live with his aunt and uncle. Amal is quick to become a part of his new town. He meets the local children and the different - more or less famous - characters of the village and each one opens up a new world for him. Amal is fascinated with everyone and with the things they do yet the thing that will pique his interest most of all is the post office that is built just opposite his house. From that point on his greatest dream is to receive a letter from the Raja and become a postman so that he can travel throughout the entire empire.
