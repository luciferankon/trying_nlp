Over the past four decades he has interviewed all the famous faces of the day from pop stars to politicians. Ant and Dec Robson Green Denise Welch and Tony Blair are just a few of the names joining him to tell the story of a remarkable career. The programme is introduced by ITV Newscaster Nicholas Owen who worked with Mike in Newcastle and says he learned so much from him: 'Whether interviewing Prime Ministers or porters his style is a rare mixture of courtesy humour and authority. He has been showered with honours over the years for a broadcasting talent which inspires admiration from the industry and love from the people of the North East.'
