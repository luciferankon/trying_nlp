Banja is a young musical genius and a veritable "hit-maker". But he has a rebellious streak and after breaking his contract with his record company (DO-MI-NANT) he finds himself taken prisoner on an island called Hitland. Hitland is inhabited by a group of musicians all imprisoned there for breaking their contract. The only way of escaping the island is to agree to go back to composing "hits" for the powerful record company. But BANJA refuses to give in and tries to escape. Unfortunately the island's guards catch him every time. Whilst trying to find an escape route Banja meets all the other prisoners on the island each of whom represents a different musical style (blues jazz pop country techno etc...).
