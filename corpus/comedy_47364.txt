Austin Starfield (Louis) has his greedy eye on a steel mill belonging to Eve Burnside (Rich). He persuades an impoverished count Leon Molnar (Lytell) to marry Eve so he can then gain control of her fortune. Leon marries her but falls genuinely in love with her. He breaks off ties to Starfield. Meanwhile Leon's old girlfriend (Bow) arives on the scene and out of jealousy tells Eve that Leon married her only for her money. Starfield influences the workers at Eve's mill into labor desputes and gets his henchmen to start a riot. Leon exposes the conspiracy and Starfield is aprehended by the authorities. Leon and Eve are reconciled.
