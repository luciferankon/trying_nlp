There is this village in the coastal belt of southwest Bangladesh. And the village has Jhalmalia- the shimmering pond that adds sparkle to the life of its people. Being near the sea drinking water is scarce all across the region. The pond has been the only source of drinking water for the residents. In 2009 Cyclone Aila flooded the entire region; the pond was somehow spared. Life and living for the people of this area their folklores stories and tales of miracle centre on this pond. With the passage of time nature alters so does environment. They leave their imprint on the lives of people nurtured by nature. At the whims of nature people lose their homes or are displaced from their homesteads. People too break up or desert home at their own free will. If people change how much do they change? Does drifting life ever finds its way? "Jholmolia - The Sacred Water" the documentary is an intimate observation and exploration of the life and living of people in a south west coastal village of Bangladesh over a six year period in the aftermath of Cyclone Aila.
