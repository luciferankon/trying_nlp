Archaeology is the study of human residues using the scientific method to reconstruct human behavior. Residues are anything that results from human action including stone tools. Tools are important in differentiating humans from other animals and stone tools can be preserved over millions of years. By studying stone tools scientists have learned how past human species might have lived and behaved and how early humans differed from chimpanzees.
