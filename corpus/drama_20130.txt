Celine is a depressed writer with a 4-year old son named Samuel. Her husband Michel is a struggling independent filmmaker who can't find anyone to finance his avant-garde films and thus he is supported by his wife. Their marriage is strained and Celine believes that it's her mother Francoise who is undermining her ability to communicate with her husband and be a good mother to her son. Celine feels that her mother never gave her enough love and they had a falling out when she was a child that has never been resolved. Her painful feelings have been repressed since that time but surfaced when she became a mother herself. Finding that she both loves and hates her mother that her mother is both her role model and greatest enemy Celine decides that she must face her problems and if necessary end her relationship with her domineering mother once and for all.
