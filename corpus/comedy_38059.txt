The film is a comic thriller and the story is based on a crook who has hatched a foolproof plan to break into a vault loaded with insurmountable riches but he needs a credible accomplice to do the needful. This is where the story takes a turn for the incongruous; the crook gets in touch with his 'beer bar dancer' girlfriend Shweta Keswani to find a suitable suite. She in turn gets in touch with several people who all have their own devious plans. Thus the contenders for the riches are plenty but the location unknown. How these Barney bunch of people crack the situation forms the crux of the film.
