Journalist Lynn Barber first met artist Phyllida Barlow many years ago when they were both young mothers in north London. Over 30 years since Lynn was last in Phyllida's house she returns to interview the sculptor. As an artist who raised five children on a part-time teacher's salary it is only now in her 70s that Barlow is finally achieving international art stardom. Phyllida Barlow's sculptures are massive and appear precarious. For decades she has worked on a monumental scale with the most unmonumental materials. After many years of being ignored by curators and collectors and against all odds Barlow has only recently secured art-world acclaim. This year she will represent Britain at the 57th Venice International Art Biennale in 2017.
