Following the death of Archer Hamilton Richard Elliott his best friend and executor of the estate resumes his boyhood courtship of Mrs. Hamilton who finds her daughter Susan and son Martin increasingly unmanageable. When Susan elopes with her sweetheart Mrs. Hamilton reconciles herself to the situation but she realizes her daughter's selfishness when she finds herself unwanted in the newlyweds' apartment. Mrs. Hamilton goes to Paris and returns transformed into a vivacious flapper; she pretends to take an interest in night life and appears to such an advantage that she excites the jealousy of Martin's girl Belle who has been luring him into a gambling establishment where he has lost a large sum of borrowed and illegally obtained money. Mrs. Hamilton tries to come to terms with Belle's friends; Elliott then comes to her rescue and taking matters into his hands he offers Martin a job to pay off his debts and puts Susan in her place. He and Mrs. Hamilton are happily married.
