Now that Itzhak's father is in a coma and dying Itzhak is finally willing to visit him thus breaking a ten-year silence. During his visits to the hospital Itzhak a beaten and reserved man is frustrated to find himself neglected by his own family: his wife a long suppressed artist whose life's dream is fulfilled that same week; his twenty-seven-year-old son - a "philosopher" still living at home; and his twenty-five-year-old daughter - a tormented lesbian who has had no contact with her family for a long time. Itzhak doesn't realize though that his ten year old daughter Didush neglected and almost invisible to her family is secretly visiting her grandfather whom she has never met previously and sets out to discover the old family secret.
