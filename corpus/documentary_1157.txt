Fourteen Days in America 2004 represents the first in a series of projects capturing the hearts and minds of people from around the world. Its objectives utilize the dynamics of the visual arts to provide grassroots information about people and the places they choose to live in. Fine art still portraits together with a blend of film documentary capture information we gather in order to build a historical archive of photographs and film footage. The latter includes selected short interviews accompanied with footage produced in and around each venue. The progression with which each venue is treated and represented will be available for generations to come. This historic project was born in 2000 and is part of an ongoing global study into human understanding. This is the first leg titled '14 Days in America'. The first phase of the project involved a film crew still photographers and a host Mr. David Gibbons traveling from New York to Portland Oregon over 14 days. They photographed interviewed and captured footage of the general public 'opening up'. The resulting documentary film is a record of 'the face of freedom' our overall aim is quite simply to 'promote global understanding' without any political or religious bias.
