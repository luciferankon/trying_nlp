As the sun sets over New Orleans the city becomes alive with darkness and light. One light shines brighter and searches the city for a playmate. First it visits an old man whose advanced years makes him an unsuitable playmate. It visits a child asleep in bed. Finally the light discovers Little Baby Eyes at an abandoned gas station. They play together throughout the night. When the sun comes up the light is gone and Little Baby Eyes watches the sun rise.
