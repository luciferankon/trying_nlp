A bittersweet comedy about one man's pursuit of a dream no more ridiculous than the times we live in "Denmark" sees a down-on-his-luck Welshman without a job or access to hot water who makes a decision to change his life for the better. With nothing to lose and everything to gain he travels across Europe with one crazy goal: to get himself arrested and sent to a Danish prison where the beds are warm and the water is hot.
