The Royal Round Table is a web-series that follows a group of self-ascribed community activists who venture to heal the social ills that currently plague our (American) society. They attempt to do this by raising the consciousness of their surrounding community through the teachings and "ways of being" of our ancestors. "Pro-Black" is the pilot episode of the series.
