Where were you on August 5th 2004? The 'Moment on Earth' series seeks to capture an unfathomable concept - the diversity of events taking place all around our planet in a single Moment. From Antarctica to Iraq; Brazil to Uzbekistan you are given a unique view into the contrasts and simultaneity of life on Earth. Independently produced and shot on August 5th 2004 at 12:00 Noon GMT by local cinematographers in over 60 countries around the world this is the first Moment in the original series. It is a journey of juxtaposition as we see ordinary life framed in an entirely new context. Be rich be poor healthy and sick trapped and free wet and dry. See the world from a new perspective.
