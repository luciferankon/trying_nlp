An interesting document recording early filmmaking in British Columbia. The story is told by pioneer film workers who began their careers in the 1950s/60s and it progresses until we see what the film industry is like in 2003. A worthwhile journey to witness how the business has changed over the decades. Original B/W footage of Oliver Reed and Rita Tushingham filming The Trap (1966) on Bowen Island.
