Balancing between reality and fiction 'What a Circus!' is an intimate documentary about Recirquel a contemporary circus company based in Budapest Hungary. The film's crew followed the company for years including during their latest show's rehearsals. Between the sweats and tears we see the performers' dreams and fears come to life in spectacular scenes of stunts made in suburban settings.
