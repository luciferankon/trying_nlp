Highlighting the talents of one of the premier singers of the day this musical and variety show provided viewers with a new musical treat each episode. Set inside a record shop supposedly run by Alan and his partner Janie Ford the pair would perform duets of Alan's latest recordings. Occasionally other musical guests or comedians would make an appearance on the program.
