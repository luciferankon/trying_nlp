With a partial 1950's soundtrack the excitement of young lust and the innocence of growing up this seems to be a test run for Ross' "Crusin' 57". The film opens with a view of a high school baseball game as we then follow a young blonde haired student approaching the new kid on campus. The two strike up a conversation as the blonde begins to talk about some of the local gossip around town. The film then goes into five different vignettes as they are introduced by the two talking students. The first is about another students gay sex affair the second is about how the blonde watches the gym teacher masturbate the third goes into explicit detail about the sex lives of a gay couple that live on Clayton Street following with the fourth which is about how one of the Clayton Street lovers seduces his straight friend while his partner is away. The blonde then concludes with the story of two Junior high students sexually experimenting with each other. The film closes with a sex scene between the blonde and the new student as they start in the school showers and then make their way to the locker room. After they get dressed they walk away together as another school day is finished.
