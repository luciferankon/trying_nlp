From 1982 until her tragic death in 1988 Dancin' Kim Wood thrilled audiences with the hottest new dances of the day on her locally produced TV show Totally Rad Dances with Dancin' Kim! Shot in the back room of her mother's dance studio Totally Rad Dances aired on a handful of small local television stations mostly in the South and Mid-West usually in the late night hours. All of the tapes of Totally Rad Dances were believed to be lost until November 2006 when a box containing old VHS tapes of Dancin' Kim's show were discovered in the basement of an abandoned house in St. Louis.
