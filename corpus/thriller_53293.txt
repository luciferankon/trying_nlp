PROLOGUE In the freeEssence Clinic hidden amongst the mountains modern studies and research are conducted on the human mind. Bruno Villar a patient affected by Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) reaches the clinic. He claims the identity of Mr. Julius Vock a name which means nothing to freeEssence's medics. The team starts a long series of analyses of the patient at the same time trying to get information about Vock thanks to investigations conducted by the Polstak. Who is Julius Vock? Has he ever existed? Is he a product of the patient's mind? Which kind of relationship might they have? The case becomes more complicated when another man arrives at the clinic: Giuseppe Vincedomini affected by the same anomalous identity disorder. The patient states that HE is the real Dr. Julius Vock. Now there are two subjects affirming to be the same unknown person.
