Performed beautifully by young and daring New York City artists Paulina Von Ahlstrom and Kika Karadi one will enjoy the film which is very close to psychedelic experience without drugs. Meticulously staged in a surreal 3 D environment the cinematography setting utilizes film in a film concept creating a multilayer time-line and a complex visual experience with multiple video sources as backgrounds. The film is a continuation of the filmmaker's experiments in non-linear film compositions and is tied to his previous film projects i.e. "Moving Paintings" and "Soundscapes".
