Sugar Creek is a low budget film unlike anything you have ever seen. Part fairy tale/morality tale. Part Horror/ Western. The story of Adam as he is hunted by a mysterious Horseman through a valley where men do hateful things because they've had hateful things done to them is the story of revenge and redemption and the irony in between. It is 1889. Adam Stanton is in a dark box alone. He is being dragged across earth and stone the sound is maddening; on and on. He has no idea of how long he's been here. But suddenly the dragging stops. He hears the approaching footsteps the chimes of spurs against dirt. Then an axe is dragged across the lid heavy metal against wood. With a loud crash and the first light his blinded eyes have seen Adam hears words that will haunt him for the next three days "Come and see." With a hard push Adam lifts the lid breaking it free of the nails. He rises squinting a sore back. There is no one there. But then he sees them; five other boxes coffins surrounding his. Confusion and fear set in and why are his feet bare? What Adam doesn't know; there is a legend a dark horseman who brings in men who have lived past their time. He pulls his victims into the valley in coffins and hunts them for three days. The locals fear him as a henchman for ol' sleuth foot and the legend says if you help the one he's hunting; the shoeless man he will kill you as well. Adam meets a strange cast of characters on his journey. One by one they all fall before the Horseman. As Adam slowly discovers his connection to this dark rider he is found by a lost missionary Christine. Through her help and the Horseman's wrath Adam will learn that you can't escape the past. Some terrible things are never forgotten and need to be redeemed; and the worst possible sin is to do nothing at all.
