Takeda talks about the universality of the human being seen through the eyes of a Japanese painter that has adopted the ancient Mexican culture merging in his art two apparently unknown and different worlds. Shinzaburo Takeda arrived to Mexico fifty years ago and has been shaping a great school of art in the city of Oaxaca for three decades giving to his students not only his pictorial technique but more importantly helping them discover their true identity and in that way helping them to live and develop his own art.
