Curiosity Adventure & Love is a the story of a woman raised by fate to go boldly where few young women of her time and upbringing would go into the arms of chance and life. A young American woman leaves her country and all security behind to begin an adventure in the Philippines that would witness the birth of a nation a cruel war and Occupation and reconstruction. Jessie is a striking personality somewhere between Scarlett O'Hara and Amelia Earhart who knew no boundaries and flew far ahead of her times without regard to sex or society. Her story of a century well-lived is both rich and one that should restore our faith in our own humanity.
