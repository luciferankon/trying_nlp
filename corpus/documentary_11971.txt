A documentary about the Nazi war crimes trial that took place at the La Spezia Military Courthouse from February 2006 through January 2007. Seventeen former German members of the SS military were charged with crimes committed in Fall 1944 in Italy in what is considered one of the largest Nazi-Fascist bloodbaths in Western Europe: the Monte Sole Massacre. The massacre took place along the Gothic Line in Bologna's Appenine mountains where an entire SS division lead by Major Walter Reder killed hundreds of civilians.
