The outstanding hockey player Jindrich Vacula ('Juraj Kukura' (qv)) is accused of accepting a bribe and banned from playing pending the investigation. His attractive lover Alena ('Hana Cízková' (qv)) quickly walks out on him taking various expensive furnishings. Jindrich goes back to his native town where his father lives with his stepmother and his little brother who is slowly dying of myopathy. For lack of anything else to do he helps the architect Frydrych ('Ilja Prachar' (qv)) draw up plans for the demolition of the town under which coal has been discovered. He also starts an affair with the architect's wife ('Jana Sulcová' (qv)) and has no idea that he has made her pregnant.
