TYPECAST is a feature documentary about body image in Hollywood and the demands the entertainment industry makes regarding physical appearance. Producers Derek Easley Robert Ray and Casey Hoalcraft present a film that will interview a number of actors and actresses models stunt people casting directors acting coaches and other industry players regarding the topic. During this investigation into the industry that is obsessed with image we will also see the film makers themselves documented as Derek a bearded 6'5" 300 pound-plus character & bit part actor works with Casey a personal trainer to models athletes and dancers transforming himself to a clean cut 230 lbs. Perhaps when this is accomplished Derek will no longer be typecast in "Thug Number 2" roles.
