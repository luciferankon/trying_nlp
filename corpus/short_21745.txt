Inspired by Orson Welles's F for Fake produced in 1973 K for Kafka is formatted like a cinematographic note book featuring the numerous questions and various development and production processes used in the making of the play Le Procčs (The Trial). The short film is packed with references and with the use of several editing techniques also presents among other things the various actors and characters of the play. Therefore K for Kafka is a window opening onto the possibility of a world that is true to the spirit of previous works while heralding future performances. The K for Kafka narrative is at once playful -drawing on anecdotes from the history of the cinema-and edifying as it details the whys and wherefores including the leading concepts and on-going thread of the previous performances: 1er Ręve Kafka and Le Procčs (First Kafka Dream and The Trial).
