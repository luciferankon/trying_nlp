A sequel to the light summer comedy. The castle's miraculous blue spring (the waters of which had irrefutable erectile effects) has disappeared as quickly as it began. Actually it hasn't disappeared but has just gone elsewhere: to the home of old Mrs. Krop치ckov치. Thanks to her ready thirst she's awakened a twenty-year lust. The younger men of the town are in danger many others end up as rape victims on a psychiatrist's couch and Officer Pepa Nov치k ('V치clav Vydra (III)' (qv)) has his hands full. The castle owner certainly won't allow "his" spring to be snatched away from him and the local head doctor who has already pictured himself as the world's exclusive supplier of "Liquid Viagra" is beside himself with rage.
