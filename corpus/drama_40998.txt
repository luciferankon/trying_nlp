Youssef (40 years old ) gets out of 5 years solitary imprisonment. It seems that they let him out just to hand in the documents that he kept hiding for a long time. In Alexandria he meets Ibrahim and Fady with whom he shared the same prison 20 years ago. What unites all the 3 characters is their despair that resembles the eternal sea of Alexandria in its vastness but Alexandria with all her charm couldn't convince Youssef to stay alive for more than ten days.
