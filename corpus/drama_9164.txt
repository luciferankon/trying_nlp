Hollow Body is a struggling rock band led by Jimmy (David Arquette) who makes a deal with Rick (Luke Wilson) a shady record executive. Unfortunately the band's shy lead singer Rachel (Allie Gonino) suffers from severe stage fright and cannot play in front of a live audience. The band breaks up and as Rachel's controlling stage mother Barb (Perrey Reeves) drives her home they are struck by lightning and killed. Rachel comes back to life now able to give electrifying performances but at a terrible cost. Jimmy and bandmate Scott (Ryan Donowho) must decide if they are willing to pay the ultimate price for success.
