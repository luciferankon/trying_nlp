Marshal Rocky Lane is sent to help the Sheriff who is under attack from both the miners whose ore wagons are disappearing and the newspaper editor for not catching the outlaws. But the editor is actually the leader of the gang and with the election forthcoming she has a plan to make the Sheriff look bad so her son will be elected Sheriff thereby making it easy for them to continue with their robberies. U.S. Marshal "Rocky" Lane (Allan Lane)is sent to the gold-mining town of Edgewater to help Sheriff Nugget Clark (Eddy Waller)solve a series of ore robberies. "Rocky" learns that the robberies are masterminded by vitriolic spinster Deborah Cranston (Isabel Randolph)and her brother Bert (William Henry as Bill Henry) publishers of the local newspaper. Roy Barcroft as usual is on hand as Ed Brill hired to do the dirty work for the Cranstons. His fight double as usual gets beat up by Lane's fight double.
