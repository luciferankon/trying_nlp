On a cold winter night a loaded factory trawler enters the old harbour of Reykjavík. On board there are 20.000 boxes of frozen fish each weighing 25 kg. The temperature in the freezing compartment is -35C°. A group of men has only 48 hours to empty the ship before it heads back out to sea. In the night and cold of the Icelandic winter workers are organised around a trawler returning from deep-sea fishing whose holds are full of frozen fish. There are 20000 crates of 25 kg to unload in 48 hours. The temperature in the fridge is -35°C and on the quays the snow crunches under big safety boots. The guys doing this work are tough. The slightest error the slightest wrong move coul be an accident that costs them their lives. In Keep Frozen they become virtuosos. The forklift trucks intersect as if in a dance the crates seem incredibly light and float among the snowflakes. Here the crude lamp lighting carves out the stage of a real ballet in which the setting between the hangars of the docks and the fishing trawler covered with a soft layer of snow contrasts sharply with the harshness of the work. It is the sound that reminds us of their true status. In voiceover their stories disembodied as never linked to a particular man evoke their lives beyond this scene. At the same time it is this treatment that transforms this group of men into a real team which is united and which gives the strength of achievement. - Madeline Robert Visions de Réel
