Indian Americans look at the stereotypes bought about by the Simpsons character Apu and recall how it affected their childhood. It's a waste of time and they're obviously yet to realise any character that isn't a white American in any cartoon is a stereotype. May as well be a follow up called 'the problem with Willie' because he's an angry Scotsman. Or 'the problem with Wiggum' because he's an overweight cop who loves donuts. A waste of time
