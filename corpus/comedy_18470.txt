Bert Kreischer's new stand-up comedy special The Machine is an hour of unbelievable stories featuring everything from Bert's run-in with a grizzly bear to his legendary experience in Russia where he was dubbed "The Machine". Always the life of the party Bert's contradiction as a man-child and a husband/father makes The Machine an engaging comedy event that is as hilarious as it is endearing.
