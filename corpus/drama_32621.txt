Dr. Manning cherishes Gloriana his young newly adopted daughter but Mrs. Manning who directs overseas charity projects has as little concern for Gloriana as she does for the poverty-stricken people in her own city. Then after listening to her new mother philosophize about the importance of charity Gloriana takes some money from Mrs. Manning's desk and gives it to Miriam her impoverished governess. Mrs. Manning at first accuses Miriam of theft but when Gloriana confesses Mrs. Manning suddenly realizes that she has been blind to the poverty that surrounds her and she vows to start devoting her energy into helping those who are closer to home.
