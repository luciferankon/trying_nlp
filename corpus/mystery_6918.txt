Appears to be half hour mystery show with episodes hosted by Vincent Price and occasionally starring him as well. The episodes were probably written by different writers and served as a format for their works to be seen. For Episode "Freedom to Get Lost" - Vincent Price gets lonely picks up a stranger and takes her back to his VERY quiet apartment. Their conversation indicates that he may have killed a psychiatrist with the same name as his guest. But is she who she claims to be? For a 27 minute episode some modern TV shows should be jealous of this good a story!
