A media host interviews a scientist about a missing 18-year-old who is the world's first human clone. It seems he's discovered cameras hidden about his apartment and he's bolted. Flashback 18 years to the clone's birth and soon after the death of his surrogate mother. Back to the present we see the clone L.E.S. walk across campus where he's recognized and taunted. He tries something desperate. Later he wakes in a hospital room perplexed. A few months later the scientist again faces the interviewer who asks "How is L.E.S.?" Is this a rebirth? Who's your daddy?
