In the rural village of Umhluwayo in Kwazulu-Natal one of South Africa's worst serial killers was born. Sipho Dube came from a religious family but from a young age terrorised the community. By 2006 30 year old Dube was found guilty of murdering six children one woman raping three girls and indecently assaulting two boys. He was also convicted of ten kidnappings one theft one robbery one common assault and one assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Throughout his trial he remained unrepentant rude and aggressive. He displayed nothing but contempt for the court. He was sentenced to ten life sentences and an additional 114 years. Some will say Sipho Dube was born to do evil.
