Follows the adventures of two brothers: Jason the older not necessarily wiser brother who has spent most of his post-college life chasing women and the almighty dollar on Wall Street and Ben his younger brother who wants to follow in his footsteps. When Ben moves in Jason sees this as an opportunity to reflect on his mistakes and steer Ben onto an opposite path. Unfortunately for Ben Jason's advice is usually bad and creates more problems than solutions.
