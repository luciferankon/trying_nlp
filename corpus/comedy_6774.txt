This timeless modern slapstick-format doesn't really have a plot but is an irresistible rapid succession of independent short comical scenes mostly without any text often using artificial speed enhancing in the countless chases which have little in common except the eponymous title-hero himself who like several frequently recurring sidekicks (especially the old bald guy who gets countless knocks all over the place) turns up in all sort of places and is frequently tempted by too blond young and long-legged to be true Benny Hill-girls getting in - but mostly also out of all kinds of trouble with jealous husbands police etcetera.
