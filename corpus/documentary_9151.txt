Confronted with pictures of nature catastrophes and seeing the global financial system collapsing I go on a journey through Europe to find answers on a burning question: How can we go on? With a camper van I visit places where heaven and earth are very close to another. I meet spiritual teachers shamans and priests and come into contact with mysticism. A new understanding of my being is dawning. On Iona I have a transpersonal experience feeling one with all. Back in Germany I share my new being in a circle-way meeting with Manitonquat. I feel seen. Everywhere people are gathering in circles to co-create new forms of living. My journey ends with hope that a change in the world is possible.
