In a coastal suburb of Cape Town lives a charming elderly gentleman who over a period of 15 years has gained the trust and friendship of the pigeons near his home by feeding and interacting with them every day. Over time he has put together a highly original and engrossing show where he has taught the birds some remarkable tricks. They listen to him and trust him completely. His endearing love for the birds shines through and although his income solely relies on donations from neighbors and friends for his show he spends most of it on feeding and caring for the birds.
