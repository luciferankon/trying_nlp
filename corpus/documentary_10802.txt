The persons interviewed include the sociologist Ueno Chizuko who opened the first gender studies in Japan and activist Mitsu Tanaka author of one of the most important feminist manifestos. A testament to feminism in different forms the film serves as both a powerful introduction to those unfamiliar with the history and a celebration of the women who paved the way and continue to work for a better future.
