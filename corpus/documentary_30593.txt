The dry season is always a struggle for the animals in the in the Luangwa Valley in Zambia - forced to share the last remaining water in the river. This is most strongly felt by the hippo population as they continually need to submerge their overheating bodies. This year the low river will be the least of their worries: An unseen killer is waiting to attack. The congested river and extreme circumstances provide the perfect conditions for an Anthrax epidemic to strike. Before the return of the rains the dominant hippo bull will witness the devastation of a fifth of his pod. This season a young mother and her calf and two brothers must negotiate these terrible odds and try to survive this...Hippo Hell.
