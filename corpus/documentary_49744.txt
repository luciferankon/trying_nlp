Filmed over two years BalletBoyz: Next Generation follows the meteoric rise of our all male dance company. The film explores what it takes to turn eight individuals into one formidable company and follows the process from first auditions through bootcamp training and creating work - right up to our recent performance in Addis Ababa Ethiopia. Altitude sickness broken bones rolling power cuts and a punishing schedule are only some of the hurdles we faced to bring the BalletBoyz magic to Ethiopia and stage a performance in the prestigious City Hall Addis Ababa. The film also features performance footage of "The Talent" from the last two years.
