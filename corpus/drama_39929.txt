A sinister fortress on an island where the sun never seems to shine . An officer whose values have long gone a thing of the past .He commands that prison but he is more captive than any of his prisoners as free as a padlocked prison door.His love for his wife has turned slowly but inexorably into hatred.He makes desperate vain attempts to win her back but he is no longer the dashing officer with good prospects but an aging pitiful coward ;every time he tries to show his authority  when he speaks to his subalterns he actually wants to convince himself he is still a man of honor.
