The program focuses on the history of the PRD a party that arose after the disputed presidential elections of 1988. Viewers can see the origins of leftist parties in Mexico beginning with the years following the Mexican Revolution. Viewers can also see how they gradually began gaining strength despite always being minority and at times clandestine parties until the historic moment when a few militants' break with the PRI opened the door to allowing different parties' participation in presidential elections. The program also covers the conflicts within this party made up of diverse political forces and the confrontations among its leaders.
