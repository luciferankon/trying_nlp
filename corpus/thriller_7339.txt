To recover $2 million in stolen money a pair of criminals (Robert and Jack)hatch a plan to break their partner (Mark) out of jail. To aide them on the inside Mark has gained the confidence of a prison guard (Ron) interested in a share of the missing money. Mark's nephew Freddy and Freddy's girlfriend (Geri) complete the group. By 1:30 am the incident is over. The breakout is successful though not without cost. Robert Jack Geri and Ron make it to a safe-house in a bullet-riddled truck. Mark has been shot in the head after a wild gun battle with prison guards. With the authorities searching for them and Mark certain not to last the night the four can feel the walls closing in. Something clearly went wrong but what? Is there a way out for any of them or have they all gone too far to be saved?
