This feature-length documentary from the Pacific Northwest examines Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) through which consumers buy shares of a local farm's harvest receiving a weekly supply of fresh food throughout the growing season. Small-scale organic farmers and CSA members from around the South Puget Sound region share their views on the present reality of small-scale farming and its impact on farmers consumers and the local community as a whole. With issues of sustainability and food security coming to the fore throughout North America and beyond Growing Awareness illustrates the importance of local small farms to a community and critiques the emergence of an organic-industrial complex as well as the modern corporate-controlled and government-subsidized global food system.
