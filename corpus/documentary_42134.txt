The documentary 'Breathing Underwater' tells the inspiring story of Dr. Nils Jent. At the age of eighteen he had a devastating motorcycle accident. No heartbeat for eight minutes and two months in a coma left him blind and with heavy disabilities. But thanks to his unbreakable will and the unconditional support and love of his parents he has slowly recovered his independency. After years in hospitals and rehabilitation centers he managed not only to graduate from high school and university but also to gain a PhD in business administration. Today Nils lives in St.Gallen where he teaches and explores how people with disabilities can be integrated in organizations in an economically beneficial way. But despite his professional success life is still a struggle. Being blind and hardly able to move and speak is not that easy after all.
