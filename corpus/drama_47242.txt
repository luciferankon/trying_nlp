There is really only one thing that has been pushing Ina all her life and for which she would do anything: to be on stage and to enthrall the audience. But cancer turns her life upside-down and suddenly nothing seems the same as it was before. Actually there is only one thing that Ina already drives their lives and for which she would do anything: to stand on stage. But a not insignificant fact is Ina way. Her breast cancer has thrown her whole life upside down and now nothing seems to be as it once was. Now that Ina has survived all therapies she puts everything to fulfill her dream of acting. In a rush she runs through her "new-found" life forgetting her own past. She must learn to accept the course of life and thereby not to displace the disease which is a part of it.
