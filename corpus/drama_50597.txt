After reading an article about successful businesses that started in garages he comes up with a theory that the garage is the key place to starting a successful business. He moves his office into the garage and hopes it inspires him to come up with a good idea. After this idea fails and desperate for a change he approaches his neighbor a successful garage dweller who is always happy hanging out in his garage.

Now with plenty of free time and nothing left to do he decides to clean out the garage and makes a discovery that could change his life forever.
