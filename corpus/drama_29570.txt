At the end of every summer 'Hasanpasa' village holds a shepherding contest. The traditional contest requires shepherds to herd their sheep one by one through a pool of water. The shepherd who crosses the pool with his flock fastest and with least hesitation wins the contest. 'Hasanpasa's seasoned champion for the past eight years is an elderly shepherd known as 'Takmaz'. 'Takmaz' is determined to teach the younger generation the finer points of being a good shepherd like him.
