Rwanda on 7th of April 1994 after a night of prayer Cyprien and Daphrose Rugamba were killed with six of their ten children. It is the first day of a genocide in which some 800000 men women and children mainly Tutsis will be massacred. Among these victims this couple well known in the Rwandan had founded the Community of Emmanuel in Rwanda in 1990 and had also created a center for street children. In his documentary Fran√ßois Lespes paints a portrait of the couple who from the beginning of the massacre opposed ethnic divisions and chose to remain in Rwanda giving a testimony of radiant faith. Their cause of beatification was opened in September 2015. This film tells the miraculous journey of these spouses from the first very difficult years of their marriage until they become a couple overflowing with love. Cyprien in particular was not always this loving and respectful husband this model of husband but he was able to change thanks to the patience love and prayer of his wife. Their couple then put themselves at the service of their relatives and then of their whole country. A testimony of faith shattering and edifying.
