Every spy has a beginning and for Colonel Aleksandr Talanov of the KGB that moment occurs one summery night in 1985 on the Costa del Sol at the height of Cold War tensions between the Americans and Soviets. As a signatory to the Biological Weapons Treaty of 1972 the United States had already destroyed its military stockpiles of weaponized pathogens. The Soviet Union however responded differently to the signing of that treaty. They created a network of forty-seven top-secret production facilities spread across Russia. Called Biopreparat it was the largest biological weapons program on earth and one that alarmed a growing number of Soviet scientists. So when one of those scientists decided to defect Talanov had the assigned task of bringing him back. But after tracking the scientist and his family to Spain Talanov is betrayed and the scientist and his family are murdered. The only survivor is their teenage daughter Noya -- short for Noyabr -- in English "November" -- and what happens in an impulsive moment changes the course of Talanov's life by placing him in a desperate race to save Noya from the deadliest and most vicious adversary he will ever encounter: his own people the KGB.
