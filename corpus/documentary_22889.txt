Between 2005 and 2007 UN peacekeeping troops carried out several raids on Cite Soleil a severely economically-depressed neighbourhood of Port-Au-Prince. Though the raids were specifically targeting leaders of criminal gangs scores of civilians (including children) were killed and many more injured. This documentary returns to Cit√© Soleil to examine the impact of those raids on the community and to find out how victims of the raids have fared in the ten years since they occurred.
