The film tells the stoy of some residents of the three Lower Rhine vilkages Otzenrath Spenrath and wood. Between 2000 and 2006 their villages were relocated because they had to move for open air brown coal mining site Garzweiler II . The film is a long-term documentation and combines scenes from the 2001 documentaru Otzenrather Sprung [1] filmed in the last year prior to the relocation with images from the year 2006. In Otzenrath 3 ° kälter [Otzenrath 3 degrees colder] we meet the same people  who attempt six years later to rebuilt their lives and find a home four kilometers from their old place in a new settlement.
