Years before "The Larry Sanders Show" came this Canadian-made sitcom taking place behind the scenes of the fictional "David Steinberg Show" starring real-life comic David Steinberg. Like the later Garry Shandling series the show alternates between backstage antics and big-name guest stars on stage. The series is best remembered for co-starring many later comic powerhouses such as John Candy Martin Short and Dave Thomas years before they did "SCTV."
