A little boy prepares his Christmas tree as he thinks about his father working in Antarctica where there are no Christmas trees. He wishes he could take his father one when he tries to catch a taxi to the south pole. Santa Claus lands his sparkling sleigh-like vessel called the Star Shooter beside the car and agrees to let the child take it to Antarctica.
