Three great questions of life are explained. Where did we come from? What is our purpose and reason for being upon the earth? What happens to us after death? Leaving pre-earth existence with no memory we all gain a mortal body in the likeness of God. Life offers the gifts of time and free choice and we can trade time for thrills base desires greed and vanity but these offer no lasting satisfaction. We find trials in experiences such as the death of loved ones. But death is a re-awakening and re-uniting with those who have preceded us. Salvation is a gift through Jesus Christ but exaltation in eternity comes through seeking and following the correct path in life the search that also leads to peace and happiness here and now.
