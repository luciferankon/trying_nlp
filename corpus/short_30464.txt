In 2010 Klaus Wyborny filmed the world premiere of his cinematic work STUDIEN ZUM UNTERGANG DES ABENDLANDES (STUDIES FOR THE DECAY OF THE WEST) 2010 in Vienna's (meanwhile closed) Stadtkino at Schwarzenbergplatz. He liked the images from the dark movie theater only partly lit by the film so much that he did the same at later screenings presented between Portugal and the United States in order to weave these images into a fabric of places and times - into a vision of cinema gliding over continents through the light of the projector.What's celebrated here is a practice that has to be defended for its inherent democratic spirit. In CINÉMA VÉRITÉ Wyborny has now condensed this cinematic utopia into trailer length to manifesto density. Cinema as Wyborny understands it and as the Viennale practices it is a constant departure into reality.
