New leaders have come into power to lead the people bringing with them a new age in technology. The land formerly known as the Americas now known as the Red West is ruled by seven kingdoms the most powerful of which is known as Karza. The kingdom of Karza started as a settlement founded by a group of scientists mutants and survivors of the war that raged across the world. Their leader Nicolas Karza developed a new fuel source by mutating his blood into a high-energy power source and with the help of his wife Gian they manufactured new machines to farm the land and build a town. This mutation of the blood had side effects unlike any other; it gave Nicolas unique abilities such as the power to see into people's hearts and know their sins. As a result he was appointed as ruler of the land and the mutation of the blood was passed on through the generations of the Karza family. News of the Karza mutation and its advances quickly spread across the land. Now generations later control over this advanced source of fuel is the root of many conflicts between neighboring territories. The battle for dominance has begun... The Kingdom awaits you.
