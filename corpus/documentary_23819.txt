Stand in the Stream is an experimental documentary shot on multiple camera formats over the course of six years and edited with the speed of our ubiquitous shifting screens to a pulsing original sound score. A visceral multiplex of footage from a vast indexical collection forms narratives of birth life death and change: the deterioration of the filmmaker's worker/activist mother her own role as a mother and the shifting demands tactics and digital visibility of resistance movements across the globe. Reflecting the ways in which we live amidst a sea of images the film creates a seamless flow between on-line spaces watching life through devices and being in the world 'IRL'. From Tahrir Square to Ferguson to Standing Rock and airport shut-downs against Trump's Muslim ban time unfolds here across changing political landscapes the short lifespan of web platforms and the deterioration and death of a loved one dovetailed with the growth and development of another.
