Catching up with the beautiful and super private 'Genevieve Nnaji' (qv). Arguably one of Nigeria's most talented actresses of all time not to mention one of the most recognizable African faces on and off the silver screen Ms. Nnaji opens up to Olisa about her past present and future. She talks on a range of topics from her humble beginning to the initial challenges of being a single mother; her rise to fame as a Nollywood star; and the relaunch of her fashion brand - St. Genevieve. We had a great time hanging out with Genevieve and still cannot get over her attempt at making goofy faces during interview.
