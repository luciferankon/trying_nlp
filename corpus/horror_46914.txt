Some kids fantasize about running away from home to join the circus. As adults we learn to give up that dream - or at least trade it in for another. What if the Circus is a magical refuge for lost souls to avenge their deaths? In DARK FABLES LILY & BILLY have joined the Circus to vindicate their own deaths. Together with the motley Circus crew they help avenge other unfortunate souls while learning to live among the dead and remind them what it means to be human. DARK FABLES is a modern retelling of the classic GRIMM'S FAIRY TALES mashing-up the eerie suspense of the X-FILES with all the colorful enchantment of CIRQUE DU SOLEIL.
