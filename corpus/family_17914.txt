One of the best children's shows ever. Garfield Goose was the self proclaimed "King of the United States." His front man Frazier Thomas would translate whatever any of the hand puppets "said." None of the puppets had a voice and only spoke through Mr. Thomas whose role was the King's translator/ambassador. They would have guests and show cartoons that as a child I never got tired of. Even the old cartoons that I had seen over and over. The show appealed to all races and creeds and although Garfield was sarcastic about everything they never used the platform to be hurtful or to further any agendas. Mr. Thomas would always admonish Garfield for his remarks and show him feeling chagrined. The puppeteers could make the hand puppets actually show sorrow and glee and all the emotions in between. All in all a wonderful children's show that entertained as well as taught valuable lessons easily on par with other shows like "Kulkla Fran and Ollie" and Sheri Lewis's Lambchop.
