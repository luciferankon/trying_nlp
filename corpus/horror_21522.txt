But good things seldom last. After they settle into the house some family members glimpse the restless spirit of a pale old woman in certain rooms late at night. A swarm of flies even invades the living room one evening as if drawn to some foul presence deep within its walls. Worried by all the alarming occurrences Nina investigates the house's history and is told by its previous owner Amelia that the house has a long history of malevolence and violence.
