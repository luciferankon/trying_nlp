Paris Stories explores the force of fiction for a woman who left Canada and her "good job for a girl" to live in a city where writers weren't viewed with suspicion and asked for three months rent in advance. Considered by both critics and her literary peers to be one of the most talented women writing in the English language this film offers an intimate glimpse of a fiercely private woman devoted to the compact elegance of the short story.
