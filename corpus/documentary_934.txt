It was announced today that a team of scholars has confirmed that a fourth century codex written in the ancient Egyptian Coptic language refers to the wife of Jesus. This is the first reference to Jesus being married that has been found in an ancient text and while it is not evidence of the historical Jesus it suggests some early Christians believed Jesus had a wife. Dr. Karen King the Hollis Professor of Divinity at Harvard Divinity School unveiled her findings today at the Tenth International Congress of Coptic Studies in Rome.
