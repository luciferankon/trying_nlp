Joy lives with her family in Australia. We follow her as she hangs out at the mall with her friends shoplift for fun kiss boys and tease them sexually get into fights etc before eventually coming home to an angry home. All the time we see her go through a range of emotions while putdowns and comments from her and her parents scroll across the screen in bold writing.
