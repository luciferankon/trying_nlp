Cabbage Fountain is the crystallized version of criticisms on historiography. In this short 'documentary' an actual however non-functional fountain in Istanbul is chosen to portray different interpretations of historical artifacts. Voice over shifts a number of times between styles differing from that of a travel program to a historical documentary. In the end we do not see the object what once was a fountain but what it is now which is an object of speculation.
