The watchman thinks that the people of village are having a misbelief to the shrine and they seldom come there like before.

During this time the watchman leaves the village for some time and puts Ghodrat in charge of shrine works. Ghodrat has this gift to communicate with spirits of those buried in shrines garden. Being so simple he spends all the belongings and the money of the shrine for the people and very soon the shrine is empty. One night a shepherdess loses her sheeps in darkness. Ghodrat who is in love with the girl holds a light all night till morning until all the sheeps come to shrine .The next morning Ghodrat leaves the village by train towards a place where he believes the Master of shrine is there.
