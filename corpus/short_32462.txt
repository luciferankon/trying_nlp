The smoky voice and lush words of young San Antonio teacher and poet Joe Jimenez guides the viewer through a snapshot of his early life. Preconceived notions are challenged as we experience Jimenez his body covered in gang tattoos methodically ironing his clothes (a domestic action often thought of as 'women's work') while speaking of his love for another man: his 'first vato.' Shot on location in San Antonio Texas "El Abuelo" is an intimate portrait of local educator and poet Joe Jimenez. Through the meditative process of ironing his clothes (a duty often identified as womens work) we experience Joe in that familiar goal of finding the perfect crease. Of all domestic chores ironing is the only one a homeboy is more than happy to master as masterful ironing is the key to reaching an appearance of perfection. And to a homeboy perfect creases work hand in hand with the power of attraction. Through voiceover we hear Joe reading his poem El Abuelo and learn of the potency of ironing thats used to capture the attention of his first vato his first love of another man.
