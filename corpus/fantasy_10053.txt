Enjoy transcendentalism. New Walden is a transcendental motion picture. An exploitation of transcendental cinema by poet singer MERWIN. "We present the only 35mm film ever to embrace the touchy elusive American transcendentalist movement. We remain true to Americana in story presentation filmic nuance and splendor. People love: Thoreau's text given by the great voice of actor J. Walker Fischer Ben Moffit's original music and the dance choreography by Ballerina Patricia Strauss. You will not find better transcendental cinema!" said MERWIN
