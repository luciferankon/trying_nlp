In October 2008 the Writers Guild Foundation presented for the first time an all-day craft seminar focused on writing videogames. It gathered together writers distributors producers an agent a lawyer a WGA analyst and some prominent journalists in the field and asked them to share their expertise experience and some insights they have gained from working in the medium. The result is Getting Into the Game which we hope you find as instructive and informative as did our attendees.
