An abstract white space. An elderly woman naked wrapped in transparent plastic. A shoot for a video installation. The filmmaker talks to her gives her instructions observes her reactions. Unknowingly he is filming a metaphor: that of her imminent death. Many years later he reenacts the shoot aided by two professional lip-readers who decipher the comments made by the woman during the filming. Slowly an intimate dialogue emerges as her memories transcend the superimposed layers of staging.
