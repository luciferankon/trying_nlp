Although filmed prior to the era of high definition the Timeless series lives up to its name. In this set of three videos actor Michael Nouri introduces classic moments from some of Maharaji's best talks - powerful poetic and still just as vital as they ever were. "The water and the thirst are not separated from each other. If water were not important to the human being thirst would not exist. And both of them - the water and the thirst - go hand in hand. The desire the need to be fulfilled is not separated from fulfillment. Because if fulfillment were not important the wish to be fulfilled would not exist as well. The day you begin to feel that thirst the day you begin to feel that need to be fulfilled: that is the day you begin to be fulfilled."
