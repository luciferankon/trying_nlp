In the aftermath of WWII millions of Americans served in the occupation forces in West-Germany. 'ID inComplete' follows the story of Norbert Alexiou who at 16 learns a secret from his embarrassed mother; one of these Americans is his real father. Norbert is one of the hundreds of thousands of so-called "GI-Kids". After 14 years keeping this secret Norbert begins the search for his father. He overcomes a dearth of information and many obstacles during his draining but ultimately successful eight-year search to find his father Theodore Moore. Now living in California Norbert unearths and confronts the truth of his past in a conflict-filled and emotional journey that takes him to Texas and Germany to reconstruct family relationships and the very foundation of his identity.
