Dan Bell and Will Krupinsky take a short tour of a long abandoned Lone Star Steak House. Lone Star is a corporate chain restaurant who have closed stores in recent years due to the public's changing tastes and this location reflects the chain's former look and branding. This visit to the forgotten store also shows what is left behind after the customers and owners have long since vanished.
