Technostorks documents the true life stories of three couples - Joann and Sean Nora and Eric and Wendy and Rodney - as they go through infertility and in vitro fertilization. Technostorks documents the couples' most private moments showing images never before seen on the screen. We follow couples into the operating room to witness egg retrievals and embryo transfers hear their views on living with infertility spirituality and parenthood and learn with them the outcomes of their cycles. Throughout the film top experts explain the technological psychological and spiritual aspects of assisted reproduction. In the end not all of our couples will achieve pregnancy but they will all undergo a personal transformation.
