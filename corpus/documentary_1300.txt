Martha is a mother of twelve and makes her living driving for Uber and Lyft. A resident of Harlem she's had a difficult past which has left her relationships with her children strained and complicated. In this 40 minute documentary we get a front row seat perspective into a day in the life of Martha. She gives us unprecedented access to some of the most intimate and troubling aspects of her past and present life. We spend time with Martha in her apartment with her young children as she prepares for her work day and muses on the sometimes painful intricacies of life. We ride along as she picks up passengers and get to observe her engaging approach with the unique characters that encompass New York City who themselves are on journeys of self-discovery. Martha is still flushing out the problems in her own life and we as observers are given the opportunity to create our own opinion of how she's doing. 'Martha' is part of the FACES docuseries started in 2015 by Josh Ethan Johnson. There are currently 18 shorts any more on the way. FACES explores people and places in with a spontaneous approach to filming and a engaging editing style.
