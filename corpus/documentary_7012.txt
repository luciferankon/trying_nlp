In the show we will visit famous battle fields as well as lesser known ones. From the bunker fortifications build by the Germans in preparation for the expected Allied Invitation to the coast of France Normandy and Calais all the way up to the tip of Denmark and Norway. We will go below ground as well as insides those still visible. We will investigate how the defenders survived fought or died in these fortifications around Europe. The most important event in the past several centuries was World War II and it is fading from our collective memory. The bunkers are literally sinking and the veterans are dying. The civilians who lived through it are also passing - yet their knowledge and stories are hardly known by today's teenagers. A war that still defines our world and people in in it is being forgotten. The sacrifices of the soldiers on all sides their families children and cities. These must be told and brought back to life that our next generations may learn and never forget what came before. The show will take us around the world and visit these lost battlefields speak to the veterans and recreate those forgotten battles.
