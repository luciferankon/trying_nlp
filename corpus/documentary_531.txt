On November 9 2013 3 of the 4 surviving Doolittle's Raiders gathered at the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton (Ohio) to drink a final toast to their fallen comrades from a bottle of 1896 Hennessy cognac. They are the last of the 80 aircrew from an all-volunteer U.S. Army Air Corps B-25 bomber group that raided the Japanese home islands for the first time during World War II barely four months after America's entry into the war. The audacious raid was seen as payback for Pearl Harbor boosted the morale of America and China and showed the Japanese their homeland was not invulnerable.
