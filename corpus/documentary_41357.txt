A documentary about the artist poet musician and hippie Bengt O Bj√∂rklund gets 12 years and three months in prison for possession of 30 grams of hash in Istanbul. He was on his way to India to realize his dreams. The character Erich in the cult movie 'Midnight Express' by Alan Parker from 1978 is partly based on Bengt's story. The film is said to be 'based on a true story' but in reality the true story was far from the dark world produced in Oliver Stone's script.'My moon' is a sincere monologue by Bengt about the story and how everything happened in reality.
