We follow the Red Admiral and the Gamma moth in their journey from St. Petersburg to Casablanca and back. This perilous journey through natural and cultural territories illustrates the difficult mission in the life of these migratory butterflies. On their journey through Europe we see a clear contrast between the migrating butterfly and those that never leave their habitat. Comparing the life of a migrating butterfly with human life is almost inevitable. For eight seasons I had the privilege of learning from the fragile butterflies' great perseverance. Discovering they have a need to survive the winters and that this instinct is similar to the battle of the ants as shown in "The War of the Ants". (my previous movie) All this inspired me to develop new techniques and design equipment for the purpose of filming on specific locations.
