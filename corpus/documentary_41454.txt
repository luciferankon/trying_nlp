A programme produced for the Community Channel by The Independent Film Trust (IFT) the UK charity which exists to advance the cause of independent film-making. The programme first broadcast in September 2013 explains the background to the IFT's Film School in a Box (FSIB) initiative to provide basic film training to disadvantaged people. It examines the first six courses that the IFT has run under this scheme with six different partners: 1) Portugal Prints part of the mental-health charity Westminster Mind in Central London which deals with adults recovering from mental-health problems; 2) Wandsworth City Learning Centre in South-West London which brought together a group of participants aged 10 to 15 from four different schools; 3) Stoke Newington School in Hackney in North London with a group aged 15 and 16; 4) The Hampton Project an educational charity based in South London which works with young people who have been excluded from mainstream education because they have committed a criminal offence or are felt to be at risk of doing so; 5) Pursuing Independent Paths (PIP) a Central London charity concerned with adults with learning difficulties; 6) The Link primary school in Croydon in South London which focuses on schoolchildren with similar problems. The programme includes an interview with Tom Brake Liberal Democrat MP for Carshalton and Wallington about his views on the FSIB initiative. He talked about its positive impact on The Link primary school which is in his constituency. Drawing on his experience as Co-Chair of the Liberal Democrat Backbench Committee on Home Affairs Justice and Equalities he also discussed the importance of this kind of initiative for institutions such as The Hampton Project and the potential significance of wider applications in sectors such as the prison service.
