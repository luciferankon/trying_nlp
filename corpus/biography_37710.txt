Pharaoh's Revenge: Egypt's Lost Treasure tells the story of the mummy of Rameses I on its return 150 years in the making to Luxor in 2003. Rameses I the founder of Egypt's 19th Dynasty ruled from 1293 to 1291 B.C. But his mummy was spirited out of Egypt for display in a Canadian museum in the 1850s courtesy of tomb robbers who sold it into exile. Now with help from a museum in Atlanta the Egyptian relic makes its way back home to a spot reserved specially for the mummy and unleashes tales of a pharaoh's travels.
