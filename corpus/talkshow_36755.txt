ONLY GOOD SHIT TO SAY is inspired by the need for good news in a world where bad news wins headlines where anybody can spread hateful comments unabashedly without any care or responsibility where we sometimes need to celebrate the good that is out there because well there is a lot of fuckin' good out there and who needs to share more bad shit. We are here to revel in what is good in any form it takes whether it be art fashion film food or philanthropy we wish to encourage people to use their voices for positive empowerment and not hate. To bring to light people and projects that deserve some light. We won't serve this up to you with rainbows and kittens (though we love rainbows and kittens) but rather in a straight up no tolerance for bad shit sorta way. Only good shit to say. Positive stories projects and experiences we wish to share with you.
