Blind Carbon Copy is a modern cautionary comedy about the relationship between people and the technology they rely on to communicate. When the power mysteriously drops out in a computer firm the inhabitants are thrust into a foreign situation where they must interact directly. Without the comforts of digital anonimity they are helpless to do much but bumble their way through a maze of new and awkward problems. E-mail and digital networks have rendered these colleagues virtual strangers to each other.
