A lovely gathering with the main cast of "Doubt" (Philip Seymour Hoffman Meryl Streep Amy Adams and Viola Davis) sharing their different points of view about John Patrick Shanley's play and script behind the scenes curiosities the acting process and their thoughts on what audiences should expect from such an interesting and important project. A very informal and positive interview conducted by Dave Karger.
