The Heroes Project is a feature documentary that tells an inspirational story about the human spirit's ability to triumph over the impossible. It threads together the story of seven young men (all single or double amputees) who honorably served their country in the armed forces. Despite their catastrophic injuries these men attempt to climb the highest mountain on each of the world's seven continents: the Seven Summits.
