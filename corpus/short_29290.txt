A short film about Brad Robertson a passionate conservationist tirelessly working to maintain and grow a grassroots community based project to help protect the Stingrays of Mallorca. This is the reality behind "spit and sawdust" conservation there are no glossy marketing campaigns no sexy photoshoots and most critically of all no financial support just Brad and his wife Bea struggling against bureaucracy apathy crippling financial pressure and a lack of support from the people who could actually help. The economic crisis has had a devastating effect on Spain a country which has cut funding to support the policing of its Marine Reserves by up to 80% and as a result we see that without vigilant protection a "Marine Reserve" is no more a haven for marine wildlife than any other stretch of unprotected coastline. So why does he bother? Because he's a diver a diver who wants future generations to experience the kind of things he has in his twenty years underwater the kind of incredible experience we see at the climax of the film an experience which illustrates just how important Brad's work in Mallorca is.
