Dionei's indifference towards his girlfriend masking his deeper sense of inadequacy to the world and to human relations is the cause of the turbulent end of their love story. In the random encounter with Marco a successful and self-confident guy Dionei thinks to have found the model to imitate in order to become the person he always wanted to be. Unfortunately imitating and eventually stealing Marco's identity will not help Dionei to do the change he dreamed of. Not Suited For Change is a short journey into human insecurities and illusions. With irony and a delicate sense of humour this film reminds us how difficult and sometime useless it is trying to be different from who we are.
