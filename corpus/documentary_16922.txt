From 1972 to 1976 Nova Scotia's Art Hafey terrorized California boxing rings with his punching power and is forever remembered as one of the most deserving fighters not to receive a shot at the world championship. This film is an examination of the factors that went into the burning out of one of Canada's brightest stars. From the sport's corrupt "governing" bodies to his controversial trainer the effects of a mysterious neuromuscular disorder and finally to an examination of the man himself TOY TIGER presents Art in all of his neck-snapping bone-crunching unfulfilled glory.
