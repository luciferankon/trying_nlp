Young Bettina Warren inherits a construction camp. She brings along her lawyer Walter Daniels to inspect the camp and to run it until Bettina gets married. However Daniels' heavy-handed management style--which included firing popular and experienced foreman Herb "Overalls" Drew and replacing him with inexperienced and roughneck alcoholic Buck Savage and his cronies--results in tensions boiling up in the crew who wants Savage thrown out and "Overalls" brought back a sentiment shared by Bettina because she has fallen in love with him. Daniels however is determined to do things his way. Complications ensue.
