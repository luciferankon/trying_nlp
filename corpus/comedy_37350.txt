Super/Imposed is a web sitcom about rookie superheroine Wanda Norman who fights crime at night as Jade Vanguard. She is a college student who lives alone in her house until a group of friends show up and ask her for a place to stay at during the upcoming semester as they've been kicked out of their dorm. She agrees only to discover how difficult the life of a superhero can get with three slackers on board. As she struggles to gain credibility as a local vigilante she has to find balance between fighting the unseen forces that seem to be conspiring to destroy her and dealing with her eccentric roomies: Gabe the anime/video game nerd Thorsten the awkward exchange student and Gustavo the laid back womanizer of the group.
