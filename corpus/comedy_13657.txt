The Single Life" follows the experiences of three women who seem to be the last singles of their circle of peers. Although Tisha is actually in a committed relationship she's adjusting to her new role as "wifey" and "step-mom" without the ring. She also faces some minor challenges with Kyle's faithfulness and acceptance of their interracial relationship from his daughter. Angela just can't seem to get a guy to commit. She learns that she is too accessible emotionally and physically too soon which often aids in the disappearing act of her gentlemen callers. Lastly Raven constantly finds herself in an ever revolving sex circle with her ex Dominique. Though they broke up over a year ago they've remained "cut friends" which makes it difficult for Raven to be real with herself and accept better from someone anyone new.
