When Bryan Haskin (Nick Canchola) discovers an unusual creature in the woods he brings it into school and presents it to his old Biology teacher Mr. Oswald (Shawn Coots) who is equally as clueless as to its origin. This seemingly innocent act sets off a domino effect that touches the lives of a dozen characters who then find themselves pitted against the supernatural.
