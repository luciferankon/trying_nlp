Four teenage boys come of age in Oslo at the time when Beatlemania hit Norway. Kim Gunnar Ola and Seb each take on one of the Fab Four's names and plan to start their own band during a time of great political upheaval. At the same time they blunder through their formative years in ways all at once endearing entertaining and heartbreaking. The boys struggle with archaic textbooks and ancient teachers attempt to be rebellious and of course discover girls. Based on Lars Saabye Christensen's beloved bestseller of the same title Beatles hits all the right notes with a familiar soundtrack (scored by Magne Furuholmen keyboardist of the synthpop/rock band a-ha) and nostalgic recollection of losing innocence and the importance of friendship.
