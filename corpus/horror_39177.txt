Johan (Carsten Frank) is a successful artist whose work is surreal and symbolic. One evening before returning home to his wife Rosa (Lina Romay) he encounters a woman (Fata Morgana) in a bar. The two knew each other in the past and she demands a meeting with him. We see in flashback the history Johan and the woman have - they were involved in a Sadomasochistic relationship twenty years ago before Johan achieved success. In fact it is revealed that the woman is the key to Johan's life now. We see that the woman made Johan make her a promise at the height of sexual torment. The deal is that in exchange for a successful life he would surrender his at the time unborn daughter to the woman. Johan's now adult daughter Lucy (Carina Palmer)is unaware of the deal her father made. Johan's wife Rosa is terrified that the woman has now come to collect her daughter and Johan has to confront the woman today whether he likes it or not.
