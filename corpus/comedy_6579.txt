Recovering at home he looks forward to the end of the war so as to be able to ride his repaired locomotive again. The war finally comes to an end. Matys's son-in-law Vojta is an engine-driver too. On the day his son is born Vojta gets drunk and forgets about his duty. He is called for but cannot be found. The colleagues persuade old Matys to secretly substitute for Vojta.
