This film is about Scott Sawchuk a young man who discovered that he loved acting and wanted to make it his career. But the film industry is not an easy world and before long the constant rejection heaped upon his own feelings of inadequacy threaten to swamp him. That is until he meets world-renowned Canadian artist Roy Henry Vickers who becomes an "acting" coach of a different kind.
