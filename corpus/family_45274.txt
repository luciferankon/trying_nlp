One day while goofing around in a museum rocket display our hero Max somehow managed to launch himself into space. After a giddy ride he crashed into the home of Kendra a Deaf teenager and inhabitant of Deaf Planet. Max is at first confused by the sign language used on the planet but is helped by his ship's Wondrous Indispensable Language MAchine (WILMA) a robot capable of interpreting every language in the universe. Kendra promises to get Max home with the help of the many wise and eccentric inhabitants of Deaf Planet.
