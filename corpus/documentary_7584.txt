Narrated by Jon Seda: Focuses on two United States 5th Marines (Sammy Bernstein and Pat Femino) who beat the odds to spend all 36 days involved in this horrific the fight which began on February 19th 1945 and ended on March 26th. The Japanese suffered roughly 21000 dead. Out of the 23000 Japanese on the island only 1083 were taken prisoner. 2 Japanese did not surrender until 1951. 27 Medals of Honor were awarded to Americans during the 36 days of the battle. American losses included 5900 dead and 17400 wounded. The Japanese fought from an elaborate network of caves dugouts tunnels and underground installations that were difficult to find and destroy. The American amphibious invasion of Iwo Jima a key island in the Bonin chain roughly 575 miles from the Japanese coast was sparked by the desire for a place where B-29 bombers damaged over Japan could land without returning all the way to the Marianas and for a base for escort fighters that would assist in the bombing campaign.
