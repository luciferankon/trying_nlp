The Velvet Underground became legends after their 1970 split but briefly reunited 23 years later playing a few dates as an opening act for U2 in the summer of 1993 and headlined their own short tour of Europe. Before they could come to the US they split up again. Shot at L'Olympia in Paris in June 1993 Velvet Redux Live MCMXCIII presents part of one of their reunion gigs (it doesn't offer a full show as eight songs are missing). The Velvet Underground reunion may not have reached America but as live DVDs go Live MCMXCIII stands as a fitting tribute to both Morrison and the legacy of The Velvet Underground.
