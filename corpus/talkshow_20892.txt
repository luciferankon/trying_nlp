*Network RoundTable: Inspiration Motivation and Education during your Small Biz Happy Hour* Network Round Table your #SmallBizHappyHour  is back for the Season of Movement! From now until the end of 2014 we'll be talking with our guests about the different aspects of movement and how movement (in all its forms) impacts your business. We'll inspire and motivate you at the beginning of the show so that your energy is up and your stress is down. Then it's time to get educated -- by our guest and by YOU our #HappyTribe . We believe that sharing experiences is one of the most powerful ways to learn so we want to hear from you about your experience with this week's subject: *COURAGE* Is courage important in starting a business? In keeping a business? In selling a business? Do your employees need courage? What about your clients? Get the conversation started on the event page and of course post any questions you'd like to have answered during the show!
