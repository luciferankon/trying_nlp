The crew at Amp=D reinvents the Deuce Coupe from George Lucas' American Graffiti for the new generation of Hot Rodding-- ALL ELECTRIC. Working with SolidWorks and Factory Five Racing they build a car with all the looks and styling of an American classic but with the components and performance of a modern race car. To conclude the first installment of the series the Amp=D car will be unveiled to a crowd of 100000+ industry insiders at SEMA in Las Vegas and raced against some hardcore gasoline-aspirated muscle and super cars.
