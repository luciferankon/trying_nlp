The documentary '16: Listening to unheard voices' will explore the question of whether 16/17-year-olds should be allowed to vote or not. In the politically balanced and neutral film we talk to various public figures including MEPs parliamentary candidates Members of Parliament (UK) from each political party to get their views on the issue. Interviewees also include philosophers such as A.C. Grayling. The release date is set for August 1 2017.
