Point of Origin Chapter 10 opens with airborne high altitude scenes highlighting need for containment in view of sustained air vehicle transport damage sustained prior hence the need to stop the radiation leakage and land the air vehicle transporter. Ironically the nearest land facility was also quarantined with the notice inscribed on heptagon and polygon shapes indicating point of origin entry not allowed till emergency was remedied. Eventually the air transport vehicle was cleared for landing after the land facility emergency was reversed. The radiation containment sequence leading to the return of employees forced to abandon their facility drove back after containment was achieved by The Colleague who also wore the shirt collar motion unit which aided the result. The closing of The Point of Origin highlights the Colleague giving the mysterious subject transport assistance above ground in his air transport vehicle capable of vertical and land navigation that also accommodated very sophisticated profile technological innovations that could disable would be thieves in seconds culminating in safe landing by ejection.
