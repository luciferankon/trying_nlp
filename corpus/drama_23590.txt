A film on an extremely current and relevant topic of today's times - Child Safety. This is an issue generally pushed under a carpet. The rise of child abuse and rape cases in India is a reason for concern on all levels. With this film I intend to get this issue out in the open and provide an impetus for rigorous discussion. Our trust in educational institutions and the services provided by the institutions has today become shaky as worldwide more cases come to light where care givers/teachers/transport providers take disadvantage of the vulnerability of children in charge of them. The movie takes us on a journey of the victim's mother her despair and her finding her self.
