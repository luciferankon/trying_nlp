From modest beginnings more than three decades ago Drum Corps International (DCI) has developed into a powerful nonprofit global youth activity with far-reaching artistic educational and organizational influence. Through the annual DCI Tour and more than 35 World Championships in 17 North American cities Drum Corps International provides entertainment to millions through live performances and nationally-televised events. Drum Corps International is Marching Music's Major League.
