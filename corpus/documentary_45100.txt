Europe is and always has been a traveling surfers dream. Wildly diverse coastlines curiously "other" cultures and perfect waves: a beguiling mix for those hardy souls who first explored the Old World for surf and adventure. What transpired was an annual winter pilgrimage from the bitter North to the sunlit South. A quest for perfect waves and life changing experiences in the most culturally diverse continent on the planet. 50 years on we join a new generation of European surfers as they trace the steps of the pioneering few who first tackled Europe's waves and sculpted it's extraordinary surf scene.
