Roadmap Genesis is a film documentary that makes the case that the Book of Genesis is a roadmap containing guideposts on how to live a productive fruitful and fulfilling life that will help our society lift itself out of its current decline and return it to prosperity promise and accomplishment. When Filmmaker Nolan Lebovitz found himself at a crossroads in his life he knew he had to choose between continuing to make the Hollywood suspense thrillers that were his livelihood and trying to make the world a better place for his new young family. After much struggle he found his answer in the Book of Genesis. Armed with this discovery Nolan made a drastic life change. He decided to study to become a Rabbi. As his seminary work progressed he realized that he needed to share his epiphany with others. But how?
