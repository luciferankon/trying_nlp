On a nice summer day a funny little car rolls over a peaceful farm yard of Muhu island. The family that withdraws from the vehicle is quite odd-looking: an overbearing madam a henpecked stammering husband and a mystical red-head. They announce that they want to spend their vacation in the farm ... "We are from capital we will pay". This quiet vacation turns out to be a frantic day with romance unexpected turns and fisticuffs between suitors.
