A quirky and often touching look at the senior citizens drifters and grifters who attend the annual Quartzsite Arizona rock and gem show. For one month each year this tiny town of 2000 swells to over one million RVers campers and rock-hounds. Standout characters include a nudist bookseller with a tragic personal story "Almost Willie" a Willie Nelson duplicate who once worked as a funeral director and doesn't always remember the words to Willie's songs and Simon a spaced-out local who thinks he may have invented caf√© mocha.
