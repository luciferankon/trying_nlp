Spring to summer 2000. Gwenaëlle and Angéla are friends. They are seventeen and eighteen years old and live in the same town in the suburbs of Paris. Summer vacation is coming up. They put in a project at the Youth Department of the local town hall. It is selected and funded. They will be able to carry it out. Their project is a trip around France to photograph people's homes. They invite people to pose in front of their houses and take photographs of themselves. When school goes back an exhibition is organized at the town hall. Full of curiosity and strengthened by their friendship they encounter people from a range of backgrounds. They broaden their horizons and open up to the possibilities life has to offer. They have many adventures and sometimes their encounters lead them to stay in one place for several days.
