The little school ma'am has gone out to a western town from her home back in Virginia. The townspeople just can't help making life miserable for the little school teacher and when a young playwright who happens to be from Virginia himself arrives in the town and meets the lonely little teacher old Mrs. Grundy just runs riot. To make matters worse the young people go off for a ride and when they wander off to a spring to get a drink the horse runs away and they have to perforce stay out in the woods all night. Then there is a crash and the school teacher is summarily dismissed from her position.
