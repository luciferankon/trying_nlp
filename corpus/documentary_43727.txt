The documentary tells of an adventure born of two extraordinary men united in creating a social and architectural experiment unique in its kind: the Eni Village "Corte di Cadore" a tourist center conceived and designed for mountain holidays for the oil company's employees and their families. Since the early 50's the Village has been a customary holiday location for Eni's employees and their children an experience that left deep memories and forged the aesthetic taste and imagination of a whole generation. The film shows us never seen images of the Gellner Archives and through the Architect's drawings models and 16mm movies tells the extraordinary modernity of a ground-breaking designer perhaps a little too 'asymmetric' to be understood in his time. A new generation through the investigation of young director Davide Maffei has the opportunity to experience what is left of the attempt to realize a precise vision of the Eni company abruptly interrupted by the untimely death of his patron Enrico Mattei. A dream of the past or a lesson for the future?
