Do we live in what the philosopher Gilles Deleuze calls a control society? Is the networked nature of the contemporary media a characteristic feature of societies of control? Or does the current loss of faith in capitalist neo-liberalism signal the societies of control are now in fact in crisis? This experimental film explores the importance of philosopher Deleuze's essay called 'Postscript on Societies of Control' which argues that we are moving from disciplinary based-societies (Foucault) to societies of control.
