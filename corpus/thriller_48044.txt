Chasing down rumors in a world that becomes smaller and smaller everyday our story begins as Marty drives around picking seemingly normal people up.... Old wounds reopen in this place of lost love and hate creeping up on him as faces of the past reemerge always knowing that the killer is out there. He or she could be one of many people including Mob Boss and RadioCab Owner George Lively (Marty's old boss) or it could be the new ridiculous and mysterious hitman Knick or maybe it's the elusive femme fatale....Veronica. The list of suspects gets smaller as the day wears on. One thing is certain Marty wants his life to go back to normal. He wants out of this town. The only way to do that is to track and snare The Cabby Killer.
