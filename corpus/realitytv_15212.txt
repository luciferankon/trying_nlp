The show will feature ten men and ten women looking to improve their fitness who will be paired with trainers specializing in strength and conditioning. Like with The Biggest Loser the series will chronicle the contestants' transformation as they get eliminated until a winner is named. 10 contestants and 10 of the world's best fitness trainers will pair up compete and train together in this physical and mental competition. One team will take home the large cash prize but all teams will have a transformational experience that will not only change their bodies and lives but inspire America along the way.
