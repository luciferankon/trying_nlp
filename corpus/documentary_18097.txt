On the 18th of July 2012 Georg Kreisler - the balladeer cabaret artist opera composer chansonnier director of theater and author would have been 90 years old. A documentary about Georg Kreisler without Georg Kreisler. His widow Barbara Kreisler-Peters balladeer Konstantin Wecker author Daniel Kehlman and the writer Eva Menasse discuss Kreisler's early life the escape from Nazi-Austria to America and finally his return. But he never made peace again with Austria... Documentary scenes stock shots and modern music videos form this special musical documentary. Parallel to the documentary an online project started: Kreisler's musical Stumbling Blocks. Students and graduates from the German film academy made a film of 15 songs by Georg Kreisler. Parts of those music videos intersperse the documentary. Meanwhile some of them were honoured multiple times for their creative brilliance (for example: "Die Telefonbuchpolka") With the double project GEORG KREISLER DOESN'T EXIST & KREISLER'S MUSICAL STUMBLING BLOCKS the music editorial team from ZDF/arte together with makido film break new ground: in this field it is one of the first cross-media productions.
