Follow diverse job seekers as they navigate the bumpy road of unemployment to employment. In 'title sEVEN' select job seekers will be filmed as they battle bias within the job search process in order to obtain employment. Having a different perspective on how to accomplish a task can be very beneficial. Unfortunately many employers don't give certain job applicants who veer from their idea of standard a "shot" to prove this. These overlooked applicants including Women Minorities the Disabled Older Workers Veterans and those from the Transgender community will be profiled and their journeys documented to show the unlevel playing field of the job search process. Everything from the application process to the interview will be captured. Interviews with spokespersons from major government agencies advocacy organizations & companies within the jobs industry will act as narration to our applicant's journeys. The filmmakers also want to show why it's worth giving a shot to these applicants who could bring something unique to a company. This is ultimately a story about equal opportunity.
