EuroEuphoria is a fast-paced story full of humor that captivates the viewer with breathtaking adventures during the Eurovision Song Contest. The skeptical author travels to Malm√∂ to understand the phenomenon of fandom and what is actually going on behind the scenes out of the reach of the cameras. The author meets different types of fans starting with "old timers" as well as people working in the organizing crew. By portraying members of Estonian Eurovision Fan Club members and aficionados from other countries the true essence of the song contest and friendship between nations is revealed. Do sex race age or sexual orientation play a significant role at the international music event or is this the sole occasion where you could find the only soul-mate you have been looking for your entire life? And so it goes every night 7 days a week. The documentary also poses the question whether the Eurovision Song Contest is still the same as years ago or has it started to devalue? Are we still trying to revive a hamster that has been in a coma for years? Should the event be renamed "Yugovision" or how the heck do Azerbaijan and Armenia become European countries for one night?
