It has been said many times--- the truth is out there. A group of teenagers with various degrees of psyshic awareness attempt to talk to dead spirits to resolve conflicts in their past. Instead they stumble on something much more interesting. Human beings don't have the monopoly on love.

As we realize the truth then there is still hope for a peaceful co-existence between all creatures of the universe.
