Ed Vaar (1929 Estonia Kuressaare-2015 Canada Toronto) freelance cinematographer who earned his nickname 'Fast Eddy' by reaching the scene of events before police and CBC crime reporters. Majority of his filmed footage has aired on TV through CBC. The rest of the footage over hundreds of thousands of film stock that he didn't manage to sell to news broadcasters are piled up in Eddy's downtown Toronto penthouse rooms and basement. Do old news have value to be sold? What does Ed himself remember and what do these film stocks reflect about his own interests in this world? When do people reach the limit of preparing for their death and when do they turn into a ward a flower a piece of furniture?
