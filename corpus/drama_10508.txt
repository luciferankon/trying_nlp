The heroine suffers suffers ....and suffers: unfairly accused of her husband's murder with a reputation for being alcoholic she is not even allowed to see her children in jail.And her eldest daughter is in love with a doctor's son (and it is that doctor who diagnosed poisoning by the unfortunate mom).And the doctor is remarried to a social climber who does not like her stepson.Fortunately this nasty woman has a brother a lawyer who agrees to defend the prisoner at the young man's request.
