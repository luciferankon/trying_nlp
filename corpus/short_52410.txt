A panel discussion with filmmaker Ted Haimes attorneys Gloria Allred and Stan Goldman true crime journalist Aphrodite Jones (whose "All She Wanted" was sorta the basis for Boys Don't Cry) and exiled L.A. police detective Mark Fuhrman. Their talk gets interesting upon turning to the insanity defense that is so key to 15 Minutes but the gears of the conversation keep switching too abruptly--something less abridged in general might have worked better.
