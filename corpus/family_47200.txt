The mini series of MICA takes place in a mineral world. But just because it's a mineral word that doesn't mean that it's atmosphere is cold and lifeless. It's quite the opposite. There we will find about ten strange little pebbles equipped with arms and legs but also with the gift of thoughts. These pebbles are also able to laugh and cry but theu are mostly driven by a strong desire of discovery adventures and an insatiable need to build. Even though these peculiar and goofy characters evolve in an organised strict well-balanced and almost perfect world in their lives they encounter many surprises and adventures all caused by the uncontrollable hiccup of a certain little pebble named MICA the main character of our story.
