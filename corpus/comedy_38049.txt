Ek is a disembodied spirit required to wait his turn in the boring cosmos until he is allowed to inhabit an earthly body. Impatient he sneaks off to earth to find a body and after several failed attempts finds Professor Ezra Botts a timid old pedant and researcher of psychic phenomena. Life fairly well kicks Professor Botts around as it does all timid souls and he gets little love or respect. But during an experimental trance he is able to leave his body behind and at that moment Ek sees his chance and slips in taking over the professor's body. The "new" professor is energetic charismatic and dynamic and from the limbo in which he floats the real professor fears that Ek is going to wear out the tired old body before he Botts can return to it. And just how is he supposed to get back into his body anyway?
