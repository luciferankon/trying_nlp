Set in the winter of a summer amusement-town "A Million Miles" is a story about best friends who have outgrown the familiar streets and faces of their Jersey Shore home. For this group of brazen youths life has become predictable but leaving the only lives they've ever known presents more questions than answers. They're afraid of change afraid of growing up and most of all afraid of who they will become when they are no longer together. When our story's soft-spoken leader Jimmy Gordon is accepted to a college far from his hometown he must decide between a life he's dared to dream about and the safety of the life and friends he's always known.
