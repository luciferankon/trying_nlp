Rose Erin and Kacy are three brash unapologetic feminist slackers. Rose sees herself as the leader of the group - an outgoing narcissist with sociopathic tendencies. Erin is casual dry and sarcastic to a fault - the most level-headed of the bunch she uses humor as a defense mechanism and doesn't get close to many people. Kacy is cool as a cucumber - a Louisiana belle who's sweet and bubbly but can be feisty when pushed. These girls are best friends who would throw themselves in front of a train for each other. Through their attempts to adult and to make something of themselves they find themselves in the stickiest of situations.
