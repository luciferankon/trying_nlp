The 1960 Democratic National Convention was held in Los Angeles. It nominated Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts for President and Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas for Vice President. In the general election the Kennedy-Johnson ticket won an electoral college victory and a narrow popular vote plurality (slightly over 110000 nationally) over the Republican candidates Vice President Richard M. Nixon and UN Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge.
