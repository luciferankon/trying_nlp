Battipaglia 1969 tells the day of the April 9 1969 that the revolution in Battipaglia. Us during the stormy and tumultuous years of worker and student revolts and even in a small town of Salerno which seems far from the tumult of the big cities is manifested for the rights of students and workers. And the closure of two major companies - the tobacco factory and the sugar factory - offer an excuse to jump in the uprising. The event runs through the streets of the city escorted by men of the Police and the Carabinieri. Arrived in Piazza della Repubblica protesters decide to challenge the limits imposed by the police. Arrived at the station the procession turned into a crowd of people exasperated: take possession of the track while police officers and police are watching. Up to order from Rome: block and remove the protest in any way. Tear gas water cannons rocks. The clash becomes hard and violent and all Battipagliese feel involved so as to take to the streets to help the wounded. Two deaths: a teacher and a student. The echo of the revolt of Battipaglia comes to Rome so that the two factories reopen. The incident became a symbol of the south poised between the small economic miracle and the threat of unemployment.
