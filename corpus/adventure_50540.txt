Reynardo the Fox is a clever rogue but he's not as clever as he thinks. He's got himself sucked into a Rebellion against the mad Emperor and now he's got fateful choices to make. Should he rescue his oldest friend the shiftless Lapino; wield a gem cursed by a dead god; or resurrect a weapon lost at the beginning of time? Worse he's still in love with the Emperor's adopted daughter who he met in sword fu school. He's got dozens of ways to screw this up; but can he find a way to win his war?
