Entertaining ensemble piece dealing with several characters who are on the way to the races on Derby day. It cleverly blends dramatic romantic and comic elements including the woman and lover who have murdered her husband and the working class couple who are excited about their chance to go to the races but end up listening to it on the radio in the car-park because they've got such a bad view.
