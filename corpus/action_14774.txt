It's 11 September again and Osama (the face of terrorism worldwide) is planning to destroy four major cities of the world (New Delhi Washington DC London and Tel Aviv). Prime Minister Aniruddh Prakash and Senior Field Officer (ACT RAW) Varun Awasthi are doing their best to stop Usmaan (Osama's son) from creating havoc. To add to their problems Aniruddh Prakash is losing his prime minister-ship and Varun has a troublesome marriage.
