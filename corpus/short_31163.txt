Ali Manigat originally from Cornwall Ontario attends school at New York City's prestigious Columbia University and for years has balanced his unfulfilling career as a member of their losing football team with his uncertain professional future. With brutal honesty he confronts his inability to gain a starting position on the offensive line the reality that he plays back-up to his identical twin brother the friendships that have sustained him throughout college and the bodily damage that he has suffered for a sport that has given him very little back. For Ali he must cope with leaving behind football and let the rest of his life begin.
