The film tells the story of five people and their destinies' that are still strongly related to European past. They are trapped in the place which they love and hate at the same time. "A Town Called Hermitage" is a bizarre small town bringing together Slavs Germans and Asians. Only few of them have chosen to live in this border town. The film portraits two generation of German- characters who paid a collective price for the Second World War a Vietnamese teenager a Dutch father of two and finally the mentally handicapped Lubos and his positive fellows. Poustevna (Hermitage) is actually a living testimony of the new Europe we don't know and its people who have very little perspective but who are trying to make the best out of every day.
