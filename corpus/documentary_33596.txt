Adolf Hitler: A Portrait of Evil. While most historians focus on "What" Hitler did we tackle the question of "Why" he did it. What drove Hitler to exterminate millions? What drove him to invade and ravage sovereign nations? What drove him to his own destruction? Documentarian J. Andrew Lee of Rogue Media believes that all humans are born good; therefore something happened to Hitler along the way. Through psychoanalysis dramatizations of Hitler's formative years and recently uncovered archive materials we paint the picture of a brutal and tragic life of an inner pain so great as to bring about the world's pinnacle catastrophe. Narrated by Paul Damon. Starring Dr. James Hollis Therapist Jennifer Embry brothers Grant Trevan and Cody Braswell (as adolescent teenage Hitler young adult Hitlers). Produced by J. Andrew Lee Shane Sconce Chris Weiss John Edward Lee. Edited by Mike Sconce.
