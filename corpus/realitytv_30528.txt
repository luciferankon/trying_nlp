House flippers purchase run down almost condemned frame houses that have been set for demolition to make way for larger homes. They move the houses to an auction lot where they renovate the houses and sell via auction. Unlike most flipping shows profits are usually under $10000 (often WAY under). There is a competition element as the flippers will compete against each other as to which team profits the most. The only prize is bragging rights. Teams are the Snow Sisters The Lone Wolf the Young Guns and Casey & Catrina.
