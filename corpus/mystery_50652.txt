Shot in glorious black and white with an original jazz score and a Washington DC landscape the film glistens with tone feel and classic Film Noir era dialect serving up a tale that hearkens back to an era when story trumped computer tricks. Artistic elements run parallel invigorating the storyline with ambient city sound and bringing bright backgrounds to dark foregrounds for the sensorial realism of art noir. So when palettes favor deception in a fatal incarnation perhaps time is ripe for a taste of desperation.
