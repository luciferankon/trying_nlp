Ken Park focuses on several teenagers and their tormented home lives. Shawn seems to be the most conventional. Tate is brimming with psychotic rage; Claude is habitually harassed by his brutish father and coddled rather uncomfortably by his enormously pregnant mother. Peaches looks after her devoutly religious father but yearns for freedom. They're all rather tight or so they claim. But they spend precious little time together and none of them seems to know much about one another's family lives. This bizarre dichotomy underscores their alienation # the result of suburban ennui a teenager's inherent sense of melodrama and the disturbing nature of their home environments. In a city in California the skateboarders Shawn Claude and Tate and Peaches are friends of the suicidal teenager Ken Park. Shawn has intercourse with his girlfriend and her mother. Claude has an abusive violent and alcoholic father and a neglectful and passive pregnant mother. Tate is addicted to masturbation and hates his grandparents who raise him due to the lack of privacy in his own room. Peeches practices kinky sex and has a fanatical religious father who misses his wife.
