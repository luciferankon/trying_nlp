Filmmakers Costa-Gavras and Marcel Ophuls discuss the nature of films with a sharp political edge with clips from Costa-Gavras' films. Two internationally known directors who have made a specialty of films with an outspoken political edge discuss the values and methods in the genre and the problems they have faced. Costa-Gavras was best known for "Z" and "State of Siege" and Ophuls for "The Sorrow and The Pity" and "Sense of Loss" when this conversation -- illustrated with film clips -- was produced. Costa-Gavras' film "Special Section" had just been released. Costa-Gavras' films though based on real facts and issues are scripted and professionally acted. Ophuls' work is documentary in style. They address such themes as the difference between "objective" and "subjective" truth and their personal motives for choosing this form of film art.
