Humorist Will Rogers (1879-1935) pitches commercial aviation during a three-day tour of Europe: from Croydon to Amsterdam then to Berlin and on to Paris via Switzerland. Rogers talks while the planes are in flight there's aerial photography and we see airports and the cities themselves. Rogers pokes at the U.S. Congress for delaying air travel and he reassures us that air travel is safe convenient and fast. Rogers praises Henry Ford's interest in aviation as well as Swiss crop rotation policies and he celebrates Berlin's busy "air house" - home to 38 scheduled air routes. After a hydroplane tour of the Alps it's on to beautiful Paris. America needs commercial air travel says Will.
