A newlywed man who has just completed his national service Alekos Stathakis is trying to get over his class' misery but doesn't have the necessary "equipment". He conceives an ambitious plan and submits it to a great concrete factory. He seems to believe that success is just around the corner and shares his illusion with his wife and his father. When his plan is rejected by the company he keeps it to himself making things even worse.
