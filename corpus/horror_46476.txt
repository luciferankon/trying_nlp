A northern Minnesota Doctor is developing a new formula to battle male pattern baldness. Dr. Chaney's new formula includes wolf DNA that the doctor believes will be the magic ingredient and hopes that his discovery will be FDA approved and make him very rich. Faced with a time crunch to submit a sample to the FDA Dr. Chaney works feverishly to complete his new formula. He believes it's ready and certain it will work but he feels he must test it. Short of time and desperate he decides to test the formula on himself - with howling results - no "Full Moon" required. The local sheriff leads the investigation but the gruesome killings continue at random times both day and night. The list of victims grows - no one is safe - College students tourists local police officers even the mayor. As news spreads the town's main source of income tourism is coming to a grinding halt. Who or what can stop the horror of this drug-induced werewolf on his killing spree?
