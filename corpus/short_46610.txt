In Melbourne eight passengers are riding a street car - two women talking a smoker with a cigarette at the ready a father and daughter a guy on a cell phone a solitary woman and a solitary man. They're joined on board by a tall young Arab-looking man carrying a full gym bag. A few stops later he leaves the car and the bag stays behind. As the streetcar continues its journey the passengers begin to get nervous. A sign on the train wall says "If you see something say something." Can they report the isolated bag in time?
