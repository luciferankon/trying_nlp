After a night of drunken revelry Oxford student and prankster Arthur Linden-Jones is confined to school grounds. That evening Arthur has the lead in the Victorian farce "Charley's Aunt." Not wanting to loose the profit from ticket sales Arthur sneaks off campus. His escapades find him and his friends Burton and Brown in even deeper trouble. Appealing to their Dean's interest in Egypt they create a story about Brown's philanthropic aunt being an Egyptologist. When the Dean requests a meeting with the lady Arthur puts on a dress and becomes "Aunt Lucy."
