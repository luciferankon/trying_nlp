This 15 minutes movie is shown a few times a day inside a cave-like theater on 6 huge screens surrounding the audience. The show room built especially for this movie is part of a huge museum complex built in the ancient city of Katsreen where the Sanhedrine used to hold their meetings. The movie translates into sound and picture the famous debate about Achnai's Oven a debate that many see as the foundation to democracy in Judaism.
