La Lucha/The Struggle 72 min. color video What sweaty sport keeps kids off the streets is "the new punk rock" attracts men women drag queens and midgets alike-and is the only place where would-be gang members can attack each other "without getting in trouble?" It's Lucha Libre of course Southern California's cult phenomenon which tears up the screen in Duncan MacLeod's eye-popping documentary La Lucha-The Struggle. You'll watch mesmerized as tattooed youths in flashy masks dramatically re-enact the battle for good and evil; outrageous pink-garbed drag queen wrestlers kiss macho men into submission; and even glamorous burlesque dancers bump and grind their way into the act. It's all here in this wild documentary. It's fun it's gritty it's real. It's La Lucha!
