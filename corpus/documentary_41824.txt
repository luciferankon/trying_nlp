The Body Machine is a landmark special on the human body that shows us just how much how many how large how strong how fast - just how amazing the body really is. Utilizing impressive large-scale real-life stunts CGI and strong character stories the show makes the staggering scale of the inner workings of the body tangible. We will show you how far our blood travels in just one day - an astounding 19 000 km - from Quebec City to Buenos Aires and back. You will see all the cranial fluid you produce in your lifetime laid out in front of you - all 26280 pint glasses worth. And in just one day you will take 23000 breaths - enough air to fill 7714 helium balloons. You will see all this and much more.
