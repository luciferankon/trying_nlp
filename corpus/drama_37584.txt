In 1868 after the fall of the Shogun-dominated Japan the new government orders people from Awaji near Kobe to re-locate to the northern part of Hokkaido. These people once supported the now displaced Samurais of the older days. After two years over 500 of them settled in their new land under the leadership of Hideaki husband of Shino. However as crops fail he is to go to Sapporo to learn new techniques of farming leaving his wife and daughter for 5 years. All this time the new community is constantly watched by the government which choose to again uproot them from their new homes.
