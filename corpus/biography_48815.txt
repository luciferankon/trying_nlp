Charleston Harbor is a historic drama about an enslaved African American named Robert Smalls who during and after the American Civil War gained freedom and became a ship's pilot sea captain and politician. He freed himself his crew and their families from slavery on May 13 1862 by commandeering a Confederate transport ship CSS Planter in Charleston Harbor and sailing it from Confederate-controlled waters to the U.S. blockade.
