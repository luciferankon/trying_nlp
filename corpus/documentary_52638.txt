The Dreamcatcher Bios is a 13 x 22-minute documentary series that tells the life stories of amazing globally successful game changers and how their Indigenous spirit got them to the top. Each week our young audience will be inspired through the stories of their role models in popular culture. Our Dene host will help us follow along through the tribulations our heroes endure and the eventual triumphs that they celebrate. We will explore how these people beat the odds to make it big as the elite actors athletes astronauts and musicians we all know and love.
