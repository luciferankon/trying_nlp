In this color special George more or less shares hosting duties with Jack. The running gag throughout is that George wants to sing a number with either of his younger guest stars just as Jack wants to accompany them with his screechy violin playing yet they all get out of it and George finally sings a few solos mixed with some old Vaudeville stories at the end.
