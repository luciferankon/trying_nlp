Pingo D'agua is the third film in the trilogy of director Taciano Valerio. The three works filmed in black and white and full of virtuosity and poetry are like the route of a path in search of fiction in reality as first thought and then in the act of shooting the encounter of reality in fiction. This is how this last work of the trilogy culminating in a set of creatures and symbols where actors are confronted themselves becoming authors of the work itself that leads them. Of ragged structure and filmed in three very different Brazilian cities from each other Pingo D'agua is a universal film which shows the shift in space as search for another identity and the act of traveling how to look inward . A work of intriguing and engaging atmosphere the beautiful images that evoke simple and real way mysteries of human nature as the difficulty in relationships fear and personal liberation.
