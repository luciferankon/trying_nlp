A surreal and wonderful fluxus art film that tells the personal story of writer director Fred Wilder's experience as a child surviving surgery and the following hospital stay all alone after he and his Grandparents were involved in a horrible automobile collision on the highway heading into St. Louis Missouri USA. Fred survived the physical and mental ordeal by using his imagination. This film weaves Fred's real life experiences and his dreams of living on the Moon with the Apollo 11 crew that had successfully walked on the Moon just a few months prior to the accident that took his Grandfather's life and crippled his Grandmother.
