Not only is Kirk Hammett the lead guitarist for Metallica but he also owns one of the largest horror movie memorabilia collections in the world. In this short documentary Hammett reveals his early passion about the genre and the making of his art book "Too Much Horror Business" while he walks us through his immense treasure chest of vintage horror movie posters and film artifacts. It's a fun campy trip through a most unusual and one-of-a-kind collection by one of the greatest musicians alive.
