The Confucius Village is a memory of a group of lost Confucius descendants in the mountains of eastern China seeking for a spiritual home through struggles and sufferings as well as a portrait of agricultural and emotional struggles that a backward countryside faced under China's drastic change. The travails of these descendants have come to play a significant role in interpretations of Chinese culture society and history.
