In a world where religion has become an illegal drug one dealer takes you down into the dystopia that his world has become. Samuel may have seen The Glory that is religion but he hasn't heard it yet. Sam convenes with his followers -addicts- and preaches the only medicine they want. When law enforcers get word of his actions they try to take him down and only a man with Sam's cynicism and expertise can escape. As Sam goes on to preach another day he may be contributing to the sickness of his society but a man has to make a living.
