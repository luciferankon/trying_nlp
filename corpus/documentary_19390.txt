As Lamu packs his sack to migrate towards the city to work along with the labour contractor his aging mother grieves in silence. Even her other two sons are not around to console her. While the eldest is working on the field the youngest has set out early this morning towards the government office. He hopes to be employed in the village itself. Those hopes are soon shattered though and he is left overwhelmed. Much of what goes on in the government office - the official paperwork the government schemes is lost in translation. By the evening as Lamu waits for the train to arrive the contractor's condescending attitude and stinginess already makes it clear that he has signed up for a disaster and it is too late for him to go back. Meanwhile crestfallen and influenced by his brother the youngest too confronts his mother and expresses a desire to leave for the city.
