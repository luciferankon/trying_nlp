The best way of knowing where your food comes from is to grow it yourself. Chef Jonathan Karpathios grows his own vegetables tends his own greenhouse and keeps his own pigs. Anything he can't produce himself he sources locally. It's his way of saving the world. In Tomorrow's Food filmmaker Benny Vink beautifully captures Jonathan's vision. There is a great deal wrong with the current food system. Meat consumption has disastrous consequences for the environment and we eat too much food too much fat and too much from the other side of the world. You can sit back and do nothing or you can try to lead by example. The chef opted for the latter. In his restaurant Vork & Mes he knows the origin of everything in his kitchen. Jonathan's menu is determined by what nature has to offer not what diners demand. His ambition is not to earn a Michelin star but to change the way people think about food. With contagious enthusiasm he introduces his suppliers. In the greenhouse near the restaurant he lovingly grows beetroots carrots tomatoes and potatoes. "Products become more meaningful when you experience how much time and energy it takes to grow them" he says. Compelling viewing that makes you want to pull on a pair of wellies and get your hands dirty.
