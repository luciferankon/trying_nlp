For a few select weekends a year Happy Valley turns into a living and breathing scene of college football pageantry that is unique to this rural town. Over 150000 fans and tailgaters embark on the hilly countryside for each home game leaving behind what used to be an unspeakable mess of trash. However that has now changed due to Penn State's recycling and waste management team which is overseen and led by Mr. Al Matyasovsky. This program was recognized at the National Recycling Coalition's annual conference in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in 2008 as one of the leading standards in all of the country. This program also includes the work of the STATERS Penn State's student created organized and run student recycling group and you will see first-hand what makes this collaboration so unique and successful. You'll also be taken on the field during game day enabling you to see the game action closer than ever before. From the night before game day when Beaver Stadium is lit up as its own city to the work that is completed on Sunday morning you'll see a side of Penn State tailgating that you've never seen before.
