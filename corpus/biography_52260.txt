An hour-long fiction film about the Italian composer Gian-Francesco Malipiero. It is his music that talks about his life. The film was written respecting all details of the scores. And the orchestras (Philarmonia Hungarica and KÃ¶lner Rundfunkorchester) recorded the music only after the final cut of the film and respected the original soundtrack with all its noises. The film won an international award for best photography in 1985 in Italy.
