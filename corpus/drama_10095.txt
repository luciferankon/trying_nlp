A young woman's lonely struggle to bring her voice back provokes her close persons' hysteria since they can't forgive her silent controversy. The heroine's denial causes a deep crisis into her intellectual family. The film unfolds by her meetings with her familiars in the old empty house where a forgotten diary of wounds and guilts is being revealed. The characters stand furious in front of the heroine's traumatic silence until the moment her mother decides to give an end to her daughter's isolation. The "revolutionary" family is shaken and conflicted as a miniature of a generation who defended the right of free speech but now stands in fear against the dispute of the charismatic yet silent child that it has created.
