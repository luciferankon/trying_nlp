This is more of a commentary on language and its effects than anything else. There are no groups of people inherently "bad" or "good" - the language is flawed...and it's probably intentional...a subtle linguistic assault against a specific group that is infinitely detrimental to all people. This is not an original concept. When I did the research I was just astounded by what I found and wanted to share.
