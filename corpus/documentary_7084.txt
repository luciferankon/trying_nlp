Pastor Douglas Wilson was invited to Indiana University to deliver a series of lectures on traditional marriage and family. Wilson was warned about possible protests and potential violence over his "dissenting" opinion but stood behind the lectern anyway. The Free Speech Apocalypse documents the intensity that ensued on April 13 2012 when a group of Midwest college students decided that Wilson's traditional views are now to be considered "hate speech" and that hurling insults profanity and disrupting his attempt to rationally present his views was acceptable. Darren Doane director of the ground-breaking documentary Collision and box-office smash-hit Unstoppable returns with his most bold uncensored and provocative film to date. The Free Speech Apocalypse exposes the strategies of the anti-God anti-traditional hyper-liberal elite and offers perspective on the cultural decay that has accelerated over the three years since Wilson's visit to Indiana University. Worst yet The Free Speech Apocalypse demonstrates clearly the erosion of free speech and religious liberty in America. The right to hold your own opinions is vanishing at an alarming rate and it's time for ordinary Americans to wake up and speak out.
