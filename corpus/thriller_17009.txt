As the world celebrated the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s powerful men in Washington D.C. - a city of monuments to the triumph of freedom over oppression - waged fierce battles against freely elected leaders throughout Latin America. From the streets of Santiago Chile to the highlands of Guatemala half a million people perished in clandestine campaigns waged to support dictatorial regimes friendly to American interests. To advance those efforts United States presidents gave American intelligence gathering agencies a green light to eliminate journalists deemed dangerous to American foreign policy. THE LAST GOOD KISS opens when a reporter for a wire service agency is tortured and murdered in war torn San Salvador prompting his stunned colleagues to ask: 'Who killed Carlos and why?' Their investigation quickly turns into a life-or-death political thriller when they uncover a conspiracy of deception and lawlessness at the highest levels of the United States government - a scandal that would soon be known to the world as the Iran-Contra Affair.
