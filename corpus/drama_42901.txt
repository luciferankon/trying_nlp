Arcadia is a small sleepy town that has been run for many years by a group of self-professed "moral guardians" who have passed regulations outlawing most forms of fun and recreation for the town's young people. Wealthy businessman James Rutledge considers building a new factory in Arcadia but when he discovers how depressing and uninviting the town really is he decides against it. The town's attorney Tom Raymond is nominated to run for mayor on a strict law-and-order platform but declines to run in favor of Robert Lawton the father of his fianc√©e Alice. When Lawton's son gets into trouble in a neighboring town because there's nothing for kids to do in Arcadfia Tom decides that enough is enough and he sets out to break the moralists' hold on Arcadia.
