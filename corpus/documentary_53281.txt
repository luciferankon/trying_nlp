A psychoanalyst suggests that the audience use hypnovista and watch these 19 movie previews shown more or less in chronological order. The trailers from the 30s and 50s rely on a mix of male voice-overs touting shocking but true revelations block-letter texts proclaiming unleashed passion and shackled love and black and white scenes of assault and bare flesh. By the 60s the previews are in color block letters are gone and the themes either explore the sexual revolution or take us up close to a dangerous world. The tales are no longer cautionary of girls gone astray; instead we're warned to watch out. A few ads and penny-arcade loops are thrown in for diversion.
