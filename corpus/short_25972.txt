A French boy named Felix arrives for the first time in Sofia. He is staying with a girl whom he has found on the website Couchsurfing.com. She likes pop-folk music and studies Psychology. He goes out alone and starts walking through the city. He passes by poor neighborhoods and the fancy downtown. At some point Felix realizes that his wallet is missing and heads back to look for it. He meets so many different people some talk to him in Bulgarian some in English and some even speak French. Finally he gets to one of the central metro stations and plays his guitar there. In the evening he meets the girl from couch-surfing and together they go to a disco.
