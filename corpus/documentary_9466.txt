Between 2000 - 2010 there was an underground music scene in South Wales that was unique and meant the world to those involved but to the outside world it didn't exist. Later the bands and artists who emerged from that scene would find acclaim and success but before all that they were young passionate and a close community of friends who just dreamed about being MASSIVE Massive: The Amazing Rise and Fall is their story.... FRIENDSHIP. HYPE. LEGEND.
