Nancy is a restless young girl tired of living on a plantation with her three old-maid aunts. Her life brightens when her cousin Lola comes visiting from New York. What she doesn't know is that Lola is fleeing a scandal that erupted when she was caught running around on her husband with her lover David. It's not long before David comes looking for her and Nancy falls in love with him. Lola sees a way out of her problem--if she can get Nancy and David to hook up it will take the heat off of her. Nancy's aunts who want to get rid of her are all for the plan and soon Nancy and David get married. However things don't quite work out for everyone the way they planned.
