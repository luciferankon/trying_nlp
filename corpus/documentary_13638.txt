Nowa Huta a ghostly industrial agglomeration near Krakow was created in 1949 as a product of the industrial creationism of the Stalin era. Endless symmetric avenues steel mills power plants and prefab housing estates. Today only a fraction of the residents work in the mills while the others live on the edge of poverty or have found a foothold in the post-privatization services sector. The spirit of Solidarity and industrial megalomania has long since disappeared but its remnants continue to smolder. An up-to-date look at a genius loci made up of the city's diverse social groups. Photogenic images of a place that has been transformed into a monumental stage set of ruin with man in a secondary role.
