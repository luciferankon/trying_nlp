This short feature film begins with a suicide attempt by Cathy and then follows by telling her story in flashbacks. Cathy is a neurotic young woman who retreats from cold British parents into an equally uncommunicative relationship with a former teacher who aspires to be a poet. Cathy's self-destructive behavior is presented as a legacy of her (British) family and past.
