Ennio Zani a former rider and mechanic remembers in his workshop the story of the first motorcycle racing team ever in the Republic of San Marino a little independent country located in the Italian peninsula. The story of his childhood when he gets in touch with bikes and starts to work as a mechanic is the previous part of a story that involves other riders and motorcycle lovers from the late 50s like his brother Italo Glauco Sansovini Piergiovanni Volpinari Glulio Manzaroli and Alfio Beccari. Through interviews vintage photos and old videos a lot of crazy anecdotes describe the spirit and the passion of the racing team. The protagonists explain how the first motorcycles were built (using old scrap parts) how they organized the first road races how they built the first motocross track in San Marino how they fought against rivals all around Italy supported by their love for this sport but with no money at all. The members of the Scuderia Filibusta are the incarnation of the Italian culture during the 60s: passionate nature foolish acts dedication and spontaneity. Good food good company and good memories that now are now captured in a documentary. The importance of bikes in Italian culture is easy to describe. During the 50s a lot of motorcycle companies were active in the peninsula. Among them the main were Moto Guzzi Benelli Moto Morini Gilera Ducati and Piaggio. At the same time a lot of riders reached worldwide success including the most titled rider ever Giacomo Agostini who won 15 world titles in his career. While Agostini was winning international races thousands of Italians were buying tickets to see races and participating in minor competitions all across the nation. The smallest were organized by local churches: on Sundays people were riding scooters in gymkhanas in many towns confirming their love for motor-sports. Scuderia Filibusta started from there reaching in 1968 the fifth place in the Eight Motogiro d'Italia a road race of more of 1000 miles.
