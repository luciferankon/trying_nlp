In his career De Wolf Hopper recited Ernest Lawrence Thayer's "Casey at the Bat" thousands of times. Here wearing a tuxedo he emerges from behind a curtain as if at a theater gives a short introduction and launches into the poem. The camera is stationary and although Hopper stands in one place his hands and arms his face and his voice are animated throughout. In delivery it's a minstrel performance.
