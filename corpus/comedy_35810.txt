La La Land is the touching story of a cabinet maker who moves to Los Angeles after his wife is killed in a tragic wheat threshing mishap. He meets a robot and a beer-soaked midget who help him cope with the incredible power of loss and achieve his dream of making balloon animals at children's birthday parties. Larry Storch from F-Troop stars as Jennifer the main character blossoming into womanhood while doing his best to steer clear of the farm equipment that murdered his wife... and may still have a taste for revenge. Features a turgid and bittersweet score by Vic Tayback who performed an interpretive dance shown throughout the credits bathed only in spotlight.
