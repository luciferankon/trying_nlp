On September 11 1857 a wagon train of 120 immigrants bound for California were slaughtered under a white flag by Utah Mormons in one of the worst massacres in American history. Through the actual testimony of a young girl who survived interviews with descendants and forensic investigations this compelling film breaks through decades of coverup to expose a story kept out of the history books. Descendants of the massacre haunted by the tragedy to this day struggle to find forgiveness and healing.
