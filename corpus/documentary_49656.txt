ot in My Name takes a critical yet balanced look at the movement of the political Jewish Left Wing community in North America and their position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Filmed over a period of 2 years in the U.S. Canada Israel and the West Bank the film brings to light the conflict that many Jewish idealists must face within their Jewish community. At the same time the film examines whether these political standings scrutinize the legitimacy of the existence of the State of Israel. The film tackles head-on the issue of the cloaking of anti-Semitism behind anti-Zionist rhetoric and propaganda and asks what is the final solution that the Political North American Jewish Left hopes for the state of Israel.
