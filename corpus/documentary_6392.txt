During the 1991 creation of The Roller Blade Seven and its sequel Return of the Roller Blade Seven the filmmakers: Donald G. Jackson and Scott Shaw shot over twenty-four hours of 16mm footage. Much of that footage was never used for the final edits of these two feature films. Narrated by Scott Shaw this film explores the unused footage and takes the viewer behind the scenes of these Cult Film Classics.
