On August 20 2013 shortly after arriving to work at the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy in Decatur Georgia Tuff (Braxton) the school's bookkeeper was in the front office when Michael Hill (Trevor Morgan Abducted) a young man with a history of mental illness snuck in armed with an AK-47 and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. As the school went into lockdown Tuff was left alone with Hill who repeatedly threatened to kill everyone. Showing enormous courage and empathy along with nerves of steel Tuff convinced the gunman to surrender by using her own life struggles to connect with him. Tuff's faith in God guided her through the toughest moments of her life ultimately preparing her for that fateful day in Georgia. Yaya DaCosta (Whitney) portrays Kendra Hendricks the 911 operator relaying messages to police on the scene from Tuff.
