One experienced paranormal investigator will push the limits of paranormal research. He will be locked in various haunted and frightening locations with no camera crew and no other investigators. He will be completely isolated for multiple nights in these terrifying paranormal infested buildings and will give up any communication to the outside world. He will go through a very psychologically demanding challenge just to communicate with the dead one on one. Does Paranormal activity increase when entities feed off your fear? Do they have a tendency to manifest themselves with less people around? Matt Benton will test these two hypotheses using his years of paranormal field experience knowledge and awareness of spiritual energy. In 2017 Matt Benton will attempt to do something not yet attempted by man: he will make history in the paranormal field.
