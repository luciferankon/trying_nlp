A musician with a social message Marcelo Yuka was at the height of his success as the songwriter drummer and leader of O Rappa - one of the main Brazilian pop-rock bands in the 90s. But in 2000 nine gunshots during an assault in Rio de Janeiro put him in a wheelchair at age 34. This documentary accompanies Yuka's transformation since then revealing his irreverence and complexity as an artist and activist. While searching for physical mental and spiritual health Yuka takes risks with new sounds and follows the signs in an unceasing struggle for social justice and peace.
