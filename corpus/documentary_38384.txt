The history of the Corps from Colonial times to the present day (1942 that is). The film's midsection details the arduous training procedure of the Few and the Proud at Parris Island and elsewhere. Finally wartime newsreel footage is adroitly blended with dramatized re-enactments to illustrate the contributions - and the utter necessity-of the marines in WW II.
