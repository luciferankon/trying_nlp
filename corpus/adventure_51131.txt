In Grow Home you play as BUD (Botanical Utility Droid) a robot on a mission to save his home planet by harvesting the seeds of a giant alien plant. On his quest BUD will discover a beautiful world of floating islands that are home to some rather strange plants and animals. Grow the giant plant and use your unique climbing abilities to reach ever higher ground but be careful...one wrong move and it's a long way down.
