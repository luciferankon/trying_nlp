The First Documentary About Hospice Care In China In the hospice care of Lvkang Hangzhou there are more than 60 patients over 20 patients are gone in a year's time. Most of them can be hardly cured. Their family members sent them here to ease their pains and let them go with comfort and dignity. This documentary adopts the way of direct cinema approach. The old here lived a monotonous and boring life. Coming back home had become their greatest wish which was put forward more than once when their family came to visit them but only to meet with a firm refusal. When holidays are approaching their desire to go home was even more intense. And they would take the extreme step if the wish was unfulfilled. Medicine refusal treatments rejection hunger strike or even suicide all those harmful measures were taken to arouse the attention of family members. Unfortunately these actions were seen as pathological sickness by the hospital and also a selfish practice in family members' opinions. With the communication between the hospital and patients invalid the gap between the two generations of the family is also getting more serious. Quarrel took place of communication. Accusing took place of understanding. Everyone's heart is full of unspeakable injustice. Ultimately the very wish for going home not only failed he instead was sent to a mental hospital by the collaboration of family and hospital. A dream remained covered.
