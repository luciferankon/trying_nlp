In November and December of 1975 between the two shooting phases of SATAN'S BREW Rainer Werner Fassbinder shot a film for television that without a doubt is one of his most personal works. This one-hour documentary was made during and immediately after its restoration in 2010. Even though this Fassbinder film is based on interviews with a convicted murderer there is no other character in all of his films that Fassbinder identified with more than the young construction worker Peter (Vitus Zeplichal). This film concentrates on the reasons why or rather the plausible reasons. So it is not just a belated 'making of' but a film about the human being Rainer Werner Fassbinder and his artistic motivation.
