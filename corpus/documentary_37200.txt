Great With Nothing is a feature-length documentary about Coach Jake (Martin Jacobson) the famed coach of Martin Luther King Jr. High School's soccer team. The team has no funding and no field to play on and most students are immigrants who are struggling to thrive. But soccer saved Coach Jake's life and now it is saving theirs.
