The devil went before God and asked: "Why was Jesus the one" What made Him so special? Any earthbound fool would have suffered and died exactly as Jesus did if they had divine knowledge of what was waiting for them in Heaven. Even an Atheist would make the ultimate sacrifice with such enlightenment. Humans at their core are greedy and pernicious. And yet with all the carnage and destruction and all the pain and despair Mankind still believes that Jesus is their Savior. They still believe that He is the Son of God and that He will come back to redeem them." So the devil proposed a bet: "I wager that if Jesus came back to the world as a human being with no knowledge of His own divinity and no knowledge of His eternal reward that He would not willingly lay down His life for anyone much less for the entire world." God took the bet: "If I win" Lucifer said "You will uncreate man" "If you lose" God warned him "then you will become a man." "No matter how this ends" Lucifer vowed "I will always love You." "And I will always love you Lucifer." And so it began....
