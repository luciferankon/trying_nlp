A young cineaste battles an independent-minded partner (and his own ineptitude) to make the world's greatest movie. Spyke a college freshman raised on The Criterion Collection and Cahiers du Cinema enters his Introduction to Filmmaking class firmly believing that his first submission will be an unprecedented homage to Seven Samurai despite his utter lack of experience. His class partner Nicki - a senior basketball player recovering from a debilitating injury - and boozy roommate Ed also challenge his lofty goals. As Spyke's struggle to cinematically revive the Japanese Edo period conflicts with Nicki's pragmatism and Ed's delinquency he is forced to re-evaluate his artistic purpose.
