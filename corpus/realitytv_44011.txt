Are you the one second chances is the spinoff of MTV'S original show Are you the one. Where contestants must figure who in the house is their perfect match. In the spinoff producers have brought couples who were proven to be perfect matches in AYTO and know they must figure why they're perfect matches through out a series of challenges. But there is a twist the couples who are chosen for potential elimination must decide to share or steal. If both choose share they stay to fight another week. If one chooses share and the other chooses steal the one who chose share goes home with $0 and the one who chose steal goes home with whatever money they have in their bank. And if both choose to steal then the couple goes home with no money and whatever they have in their bank goes to the couple who ranked last place.
