In the small town of Suprasl in northeast Poland behind the walls of an ordinary house that was once a Communist Party headquarter we discover the Wierszalin theatre and its company. Italian filmmaker Francesco Carrozzini discovered them in New York when they came to perform Saint Oedipus in a production that subtly combined the Greek tragedy with Thomas Mann's book The Holy Sinner. Highly impressed the young filmmaker persuaded the director Piotr Tomaszczuk to let him follow them back to Poland to make a documentary about their developing a new play Nijinsky's God. Wierszalin takes us right into the enclosed theatre world in which the company explores art spirituality and sexuality not only through the prism of the stage and their performance but also through the personal lives of the actors.
