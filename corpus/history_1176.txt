In an unprecedented gesture of community spirit seven leading news anchors from commercial stations around the state have joined us in the telling of Michigan's involvement in one of the most important events in American History. While every eighth grader in Michigan is taught the civil war Michigan's tremendous contribution has become a part of lost history. We contributed over 90000 men and one woman Sarah Emma Edmonds from Flint Michigan. There was General George Armstrong Custer who was from Monroe Michigan. It was Michigan senator Jacob Howard who had a large hand in penning the 13th 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution. Nearly 15000 brave and patriotic men gave their lives to preserve the Union. The Michigan Experience: The American Civil War Years offers viewers an unprecedented look at the hidden and forgotten stories of the lives of men and women and how they made sense of their role in the Civil War by telling stories using the narrative mode of living historians.
