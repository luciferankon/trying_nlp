Bach Star Caf√© follows a dedicated ensemble of Longy School of Music graduate students as they master Bach's irreverent Coffee Cantata. They surprise listeners - and sometimes themselves - when they take their modern interpretation of the oft-neglected piece out of the concert hall and into Boston area coffee shops nursing homes and schools delighting audiences and challenging stereotypes about classical music being boring or old-fashioned.
