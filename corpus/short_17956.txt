This is the story of Don who owns CSE Inc. which specializes in furniture possessions repossessions and removals. This is all well and good except that Don has a deep abiding fear of sofas stemming from an unfortunate yet tragic event some fifteen years ago. When the job of a lifetime comes along Don tries to turn it down. But his buxom beautiful yet classy secretary Sophie who has a soft spot in her heart for Don convinces him that the consequences of his not taking the job will be far more painful than facing his fears. Don reluctantly agrees and goes to see the client. From here we learn of Don's terror and its cause. With the support of a "true love" that transcends time and death Don is able to confront the possessed sofa and fight the ultimate (well at least so far) battle.
