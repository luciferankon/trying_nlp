A girl is sitting alone in one of a train's compartments on her way to salvation; her shadow is on the window's glass staring out at the passing scenes out side the train's window and imagining; the abstract imaginations. We see what she sees; we hear what she imagines and with togetherness of the images from the real scenes in the way that the girl sees them and the sounds which are in her imaginations the abstracts moments will be create. The abstract moments just like the phrases of a poem by an Iranian poet Sohrab Sepehri "I saw a train which was carrying light." At last the girl sees a woman beside another passing train's window in her red suitewho is staring out at the passing scenes out side the train just like the girl herself. Maybe salvation is something like that!
