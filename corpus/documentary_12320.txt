Passing time fills a central role in Baderech Ha'baita. Using old 8 mm. films and an intimate portrayal of the significant events in his personal life over the last fifteen years director Tomer Heymann (It Kinda Scares Me Paper Dolls Bridge Over the Wadi) reveals a charged and surprising emotional world. Shooting with a small video cam gives Baderech Ha'baita a feeling of great intimacy with the main characters and the director himself who deals with personal familial and national crises through his obsessive filming constantly seeking his way back home.
