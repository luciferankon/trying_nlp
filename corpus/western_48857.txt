Fleeing a sheriff's posse after being unjustly accused as horse-thieves Dave "Kansas Kid" Hill and Sagebrush Charlie are befriended by Ed Dawson who is wounded while helping them escape. Kansas take Ed to a doctor in Tonto City and Ed offers them jobs with his father's trail herd. They report to Dawson's foreman Slavens who instead sends them to the rival Coulter outfit. Suspicious to Slaven's motives Ed sends Kansas and Charlie ahead to his father's ranch where due to a misunderstanding his sister Mary tries to ambush them. They sign up with Mr. Dawson just in time to hear the trail boss Red trying to get the hands to quit Dawson and join Coulter. Kansas stops this but Mary has found a reward poster on Kansas and Charlie and notifies Sheriff Warner.
