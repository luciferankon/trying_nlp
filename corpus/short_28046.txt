HEE is a short experimental and subjective film. It explores the creative process of writing. It takes place in both the imaginary and physical world of a writer even though the lines are often easily blended together. HEE attempts to answer the question of who writes a story: the writer or his character. In this world of paranoia it is hard to tell who inspires the other and where the ideas and experiences come from. It is up to the viewer to unlock the mystery of HEE.
