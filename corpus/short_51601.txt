Wearing the Face won the National Award for the Best Investigative Film in 2001. The film probes the "face" behind the masked faces of Manipuri rickshaw pullers in a humane way. The social fabric the collective psyche and the economic and political realities of Manipur emerge out as a resultant of this lens-eye witness account of the illegal rickshaw-pullers who keep their faces veiled for fear of being caught.
