In the 18th century sloops were the workhorses of New York Harbor and the Hudson River; with the advent of train and truck delivery ships fell out of favor in the U.S. Until the late 1960s when activist/musician Pete Seeger and his unique environmental group Clearwater built a boat modeled after those earlier versions to help educate and draw attention to environmental pollutions then wracking America's First River. Launched in 1970s among the 'Clearwater's' first sails was to Washington D.C. to deliver petitions to Congress that eventually helped create some of the country's first environmental laws particularly the Clean Water Act of 1972. Ever since the wooden ship has come to be recognized up and down the Hudson as it continues its mission of education and environmental protection. During the summer of 2016 the boat was in dry-dock being repaired and we followed the restoration from beginning to relaunch. The film is both a link to the past and a look to the future: In June 2017 the 'Clearwater' will again sail to D.C. this time carrying petitions asking for the continuation of the environmental protections we have but are at great risk. The film is also a look at the history of activism in the Hudson Valley where many believe today's environmental movement was born led by Pete Seeger and others. (A 20-minute version of the finished doc will be available on 6.15.)
