A chic 1930s cabaret. The atmosphere is cool but electric. The patrons dressed to the nines speak in hushed tones - we catch snippets of conversation see eyes meet and smiles exchanged. There's a sense of anticipation as though champagne corks are ready to pop. Ladies and gentlemen the evening is getting underway! Couples meet to the sound of a cappella voices singing of love. The music - by Luc Plamondon Patricia Kaas Edith Piaf GÃ©rard Lenorman Jean-Pierre Ferland and others - is sung by adults. But the couples are played by children: 26 seven-year-old whose teacher worked with them throughout the project. It's a dance-filled evening of emotion: from love to laughter tears anger and back to love again. Voices mingle and dancers glide through an evening bursting with life and excitement.
