In 2004 my dad was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The symptoms (stiff body lethargic walking slurred talking) forced him into retirement at the age of 50 from a profession that he so loved in teaching. His symptoms progressed at a rate that was uncommon for a Parkinson's sufferer which led doctors to re-diagnose dad with Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA) a more severe neurological condition with an average prognosis of nine years. A few years ago I started filming dad aware that our time together would be affected and significantly shortened by this re-diagnosis. Initially I planned for the film to be a short piece as a way of preserving our relationship through film as he had done with his family through home videos. The film grew and grew leading to the involvement of a video production company and now finally it has hour long documentary. The film documents my dad's disease how it affects his relationships his self-image and his deterioration. In it I attempt to remind him of the worth he still has left of the lives he has touched and the difference he has made. To do so I took him back to school to meet his former students to give one last lecture.
