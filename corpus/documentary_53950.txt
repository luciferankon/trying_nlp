Love peace happiness drugs and art. A film about Dutch new media artist Micha Klein (1964). Micha Klein was a pioneer of the digital image culture and gained international fame as a computer artist in the 90's with his manipulated photos of perfect people in stylized virtual landscapes and architectural spaces. At the same time Klein one of the first VJ's became an icon in the developing house scene. Throughout this time Klein had held onto his 'Utopian lifestyle' where he attempts to 'live' as in the virtual world from his images. Director Corinne van Egeraat follows Klein as he works on his new art series. The unique personal archive materialÂ combined with interviews and activities throughout the past year makes this a unique time document. 'Speeding on the Virtual Highway' confronts us with how fast digital developments go and how quickly times change especially if you're living in the fast lane.
