This short film utilizes the relatively new film viewing process of 3-D. The specially designed glasses required to view the movie in 3-D are made to be held in the right hand over the eyes (with the red lens of the glasses covering the right eye) leaving the left hand free to reach out to try and grab the images seemingly coming out of the screen. These images include blown smoke rings a violin bow a protruding off center camera lens a sling-shotted item a pinching crab juggled items thrown items a sliding baseball player amusement park rides a racing fire truck with its protruding ladder a shooting fire hose and items dropped from several stories high.
