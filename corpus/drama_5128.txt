Anirudh Godbole and Naina are a contemporary upwardly mobile middle-class Maharashtrian couple. They stay with their 2 daughters in a comfortable flat in suburban Mumbai. Anirudh has a well-paid job in a corporate firm and Naina is a rising singer. They invite few of their close friends over dinner to celebrate the release of Naina's music album. The evening begins on a very pleasant and relaxed note. Soon they witness the crime being committed in the neighbouring building and the evening turns into a moral hell for all.
