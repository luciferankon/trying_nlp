Ever since the Seminole Wars of the mid nineteenth century an unlucky few have gone missing in the Florida Everglades every couple of years especially around Columbus Day Weekend. "Bikini Swamp Girl Massacre" is based on a true story told by the lone survivor of a group of beautiful young women who left the concrete jungle of South Beach to venture deep into the Everglades jungle where they were brutally murdered by a Seminole warrior spirit named Coowahchobee. As the women go missing one by one and the seemingly innocent tour guide denies foul play one brave beach bunny risks her life to escape alone in the jungle knowing that she is safer with the snakes and alligators then at camp with Coowahchobee.
