Supported by a large pool of guest actors Carry Goossens and Jan Van Dyke (and originally also Gaston Berghmans) star in a series of short often stereotypical comedy sketches. These quickies are supplemented with some longer serials that return every episode. The adventures of two clumsy handymen are shown in "Sus & Klus" while in "Tommeke" a funny ginger rascal continuously makes his mother end up in total embarrassment.
