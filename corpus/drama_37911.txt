Following the tragic death of a spouse six old friends re-unite for a backpacking trip deep into the woods hoping to mend the pain and bring back balance. 'The Answer' is a sometimes-comedic 2nd-coming-of-age drama that aims to re-define contemporary masculinity and create a new genre of film -- the 'male chick flick.' It is a human story about the oft-neglected relationships between men and the friendships that lead the way to coping with life's difficulties.
