Anything which is psychical has to do not with the solid material world but with the mind or soul. Thus apparitions are psychical phenomena because they exist in our minds and do not have the solid physical form. Visions dreams nightmares are all psychical; they belong to our inner lives though they may be telling us about our lives in the physical world.
