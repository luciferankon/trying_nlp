Some times you have to die to get the girl. Jack Applewhite a young slacker has a crippling crush on Heather the girl who works at the corner coffee shop. He's a decent looking guy but painfully shy around her. He finally gets the nerve to ask her out and invites her to a party at his apartment building. When she arrives they are really hitting it off and Jack decides to impress her with his famous skateboard jump from the roof of his building into the pool. As he races to the edge she rushes to stop him and almost falls. He pushes her back and launches himself into the air. He misses the pool and crashes into the pavement. When he gets up off the ground he's the last to know that he's...dead. Soon arriving in a large cloud of smoke is the weed smoking wise cracking Grim Reaper (Snoop Dog) who is really pissed off. Apparently it was Heather's time and Jack messed up God's plan. The Reaper shows Jack his spiritual destiny and it isn't pretty...an eternity in Limbo. They are both in trouble. The Reaper has to answer to the man upstairs and he's already behind on his soul reaping duties. They cut a deal. If Jack helps him catch up he'll help him get a better deal in the afterlife. So the Reaper hands him a soul reaping Blackberry and tells him to get busy. One problem...Heather's name keeps coming up and Jack does everything he can to keep her from dying making things worse. When Jack learns he can enter the bodies of the living to try and hook up with her he gets in even more trouble with the Reaper. In the end he has to make a choice saving Heather or an eternity of torment in Hell. REAPER MADNESS is a hilarious comedy about love and death and the meaning of life.
