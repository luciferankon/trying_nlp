Abraham Ashley and his loosely pulled together gang of thieves plan a heist to rob the Federal District Reserve Bank (Memphis Branch). Little do they know that the Feds are the least of their problems. A series of pulp gangsters come out of the woodwork bringing back events from the past and debts that still have to be paid. Somewhere along the way all of the "Threads" pull together for a clever heist that seems too good to be true.
