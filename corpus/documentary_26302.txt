This is an interesting documentary about Stalin his rise to power and the invasion of the USSR by Germany in WWII. It's split into two parts the first a general overview of the early history. The second part is the details of WWII and after. David Reynolds does an excellent job of explaining what happened with snippets from diaries letters and other contemporaneous accounts. Well-assembled historical work.
