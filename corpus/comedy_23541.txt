A slightly manic traffic policeman who is utterly devoted to service and duty Antonis Pikrocholos applies the traffic code with unyielding severity. Tickets rain down upon law-breakers - in particular taxi-drivers and especially Lampros who happens to be in love with Pikrocholos' sister Fofo. In his turn the traffic policeman is in love with a businessman's daughter Kiki who is afraid to reveal her feelings to her father. Besides Antonis has given lots of traffic tickets to a bus belonging to her father's company. For all these reasons the road to marriage for both couples is long and strewn with obstacles but the outcome is a happy one for everyone involved.
