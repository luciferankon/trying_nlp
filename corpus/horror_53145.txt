Two very intelligent but very unbalanced addicts just graduated from high school and lost in a world of drugs decide to find a past time to occupy their minds and fill their direction-less days. Researching paranormal events piques their interest and their research leads them to a haunted and now abandoned hospital in their area. For the hell of it they decide to post their findings on the Internet. Unexpectedly their article gets bought by a major magazine earning them a big pay check a grant and keys to the hospital to continue their research. They take the money and do what any other stoner teenager in their position would do: they throw a party. Many miscellaneous drugs and several hits of acid later all of their nightmares begin to turn to stark reality and a terrible host of inner demons comes to life. In the dark hallways of the abandoned hospital they prove that compared to anything paranormal human nature is darker by far.
