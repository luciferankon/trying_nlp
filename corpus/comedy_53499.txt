Dan Fish is bored with his life. And so is his best mate Gareth who has to listen to him whine about it. The complaint is always the same: compared to the schooldays he and Gareth shared adulthood's just rubbish. Then much to his surprise a bit of excitement enters Dan's life: he witnesses a crime. Better still the perpetrator is none other than Tony Dear a mean and dangerously dozy thug who used to bully Dan at school. Naturally Dan's first instinct is to blackmail him. But when this doesn't pay off Gareth starts exerting his Childish influence and another plan is formed. A bold plan. An exciting plan. An irretrievably stupid plan. That ends very badly...
