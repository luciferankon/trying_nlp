People make mistakes. High School was a big change for Lillian. Bigger classes more people more problems. Lillian's best friend Dalia knows alot of seniors. Seniors who had parties lots of parties parties that Lillian was invited to. Lillian started smoking pot. Until one day when she realized that what she had once called a high had become normal. She realized what she was givng up emotion passion feeling. She was giving up life. She needs help. She is ready to get help from her mother. She's been lucky so far but in the future? You never actually know what your smoking. All it takes is one time.
