This documentary is about the tragic life of Charmaine Mare a young girl who had come to Cape Town in search of work to help provide financial support for her poverty stricken parents. Mare arrived in Cape Town in January 2013 and stayed with a friend Kristina White in Kraaifontein. But for a few days she would be left alone with Johannes de Jager the boyfriend of her friend's mother. In those few days court records show that Mare frequently had to plead with him not to make sexual advances and even recorded their conversations. Sadly nobody listened to her pleas for help with tragic consequences.
