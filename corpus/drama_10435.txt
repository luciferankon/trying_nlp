Between You and Me is a character driven Feature Film following four women in their late twenties during a Hen weekend on a Boat. They are 'supposed' to be adults but feel far from it. They don't have their relationships or careers in the places they think they should be - We follow them on their individual journeys of discovery. Come on board and join the party with Claire (the bride) Freda (Maid of honour) Amanda (missed out Maid of Honour) and Lola (Up for an adventure). The action sets off in the city of London continuing further into the countryside. Freda has hired the narrow boat "off the internet" and they have been instructed to get it to 'Bodhi' otherwise translated as 'Enlightenment'. Whether it's all plain sailing or not it's putting forward the notion that it is not the destination but the journey that matters.
