The Rise of Shay has been inspired by Madonna and her music video of Vogue. The song Sitemail is about Kelan. Max's World is a song inspired by innocence and humbleness of Max Dallas and Zeus the dog from Notmax. Bennie's World was to glorify Bennie as a Rock Star because there were too many hate comments about him when he was such a nice person. Cole was a unique person he was good at heart and passionate. Frathouse Activity was dedicated to Benji Jace  Minnie Girl Vince and Cole. All these editions are as well called Canadian as the audio has been remixed differently with vocals and music. The songs at their best and fullest. Jeanie is the song about year 2010 when I first joined Fratpad it was the Gene and Theo show and I had no idea what this website was and the show. The song has also been inspired by the Barbara Streisand song Duck Sauce Katy Perry-Firework and Teenage Dream and Like a G6 by the Far East Movement.
