Starting with a brief history of Dane Rauschenberg's running career we delve right into this documentary as a skeleton crew takes him to the starting line of this 202 mile race. The film follows Dane as he runs from Gettysburg PA to Washington DC with snippets of film showing how his crew of at first only two (then later four) try to navigate and support a man taking on this type of adventure. With no real competition per se the film is not whether Dane will win the race or not but rather how hard he will have to push himself and what obstacles must he overcome in order to run for 202 miles straight.
