I've always appreciated that this series doesn't dumb its subject matter down. The Big Aquarium is no exception. Shot on location at the Tennessee Aquarium this feature is entertaining and educational. Unlike many kids programs there are no humans in goofy costumes no singing and no precious moments. The animals are the stars. They aren't sensationalized as "The world's deadliest" or "Amazing killing machines" just as fascinating creatures from around the world. My son loved this when he was four and five years old and he (actually we) watched it over and over.
