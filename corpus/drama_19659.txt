Beachhead Point. A town whose summers are known for boardwalks filled with sun-kissed tourists who scatter away from the harsh winters leaving the snow-covered streets in silent desolation. For 23-Year-Old Gray Richardson life here in Beachhead Point has been nothing but a plethora of picturesque backdrops snobby tourists with million dollar beach homes and quirky locals that are a perfect fit for his love of cinematic artistry. As he dreams of becoming an independent film director in this oceanic town Gray's life begins to slowly deteriorate leaving him to believe that life may be better outside of the town he had once known as home.
