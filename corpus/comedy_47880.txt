Direction is a series comedy that was conceived and written by Matt Kerstetter and Philip Dallmann which tells the story of an acting teacher with a reoccurring case of mistaken identity and his 4 acting students - Christina a young method actress with an ever-changing stage name; Glenn who's majority of social interaction takes place in the fires of Mordor... aka his mother's basement; Bridgette who was decapitated 14 times on screen in 1992; and Ray a former child actor who returns to acting for the first time since his JELLO commercial at age 7. This acting class goes on a journey together while carefully following their teacher's direction.
