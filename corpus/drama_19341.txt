Jim Brockton had three interests in life: His nephew Donald: the Trinity three friends of different nationalities but united by their love for Jim; and a faithful dog named Lady. His affection for Donald his nephew was entirely misplaced and that unworthy young man laughed at his uncle every time he got a check from him and proceeded to spend it upon riotous living. Christmas came and with it Donald who immediately proceeded to call his club friends around him and have a good time. Jim naturally was hurt but excused Donald on the ground that youth seeks youth. But when he discovered his nephew and a group of his friends bear-baiting a poor beggar even his faith got a shock but he took the derelict home and into his household and his heart. The next day the three friends introduced Jim to Mary an admirable woman and a year from that date saw them married. When Donald came home for Christmas a situation arose which was fraught with great danger for Donald had previously been engaged to Mary and had been low enough to permit an action of his toward her to be sadly misconstrued destroying her reputation. In an endeavor to compromise her again the ingrate brought about two events which came near to wrecking Donald's life but the old derelict saved the situation and exposed Donald for what he was.
