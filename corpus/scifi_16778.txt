Not long ago the people of an unnamed country were involved in a civil war. After the armistice both sides noticed hundreds of bodies unaccounted for. Looking through their land there was discovered a place where men would vanish from sight. Those who returned spoke of a zone governed by cruel logic. This place dubbed The Ulterior was closed off and a guard was placed at its entry. The curious have found their way to its borders believing it holds healing properties and that it can reunite the living and the dead.
