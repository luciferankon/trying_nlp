This documentary features survivors of the Nazi Occupation from 1940-45 telling their very moving and very personal story about growing up in the only part of the British Isles to suffer under German occupation during the Second World War. The film contains some rare never-before-seen footage taken by the local inhabitants at the time -- and under threat of death if they were found out. Of Jersey's 97000 population at the time nearly one third were evacuated before the Germans arrived in 1940. During the next two years 2200 were forcibly sent to internment camps in Germany. The remaining 66000 were occupied by a total of 28500 German troops -- more than one soldier for every three Islanders. 4000 people were imprisoned on the Island and more than 600 were sent to concentration camps in Germany France and Poland. More than 13600 foreign workers were brought to the Island as slave labour and more than 600 died in captivity -- mostly Russians. For the children of Jersey growing up during the Occupation meant lost youth -- this is their story in their words.
