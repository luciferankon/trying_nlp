Bj≈ôrn-Erik was a 19 year old devoted Christian. When he determined that he was gay who decided to kill himself rather than living a "dirty and sinful" life. Through excerpts from his diary we learn that he didn't seek any guidance and he got none. His friends and family are interviewed as well as a gay Lutheran couple and some Christian fundamentalists.
