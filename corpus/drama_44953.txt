A Message To Brian is a gripping supernatural drama about culture and tradition in a modern world. A thought provoking sage that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Some 40 years ago in a small village in Nigeria a young woman made a deal with a spiritualist for a male child but before she could carry out the ritual her 8 year old daughter stole the potion setting dire consequences into motion. In Present day America the now older daughter is dealing with the death and ruin she has brought to those around her as works to reconcile her mistakes before she pays the ultimate price.
