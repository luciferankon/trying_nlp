Things aren't going well for Bobby Soporno. He's getting his daughter off to college but it turns out that a lot of the things she's studying there aren't on the curriculum. Not only that but she's having an affair with one of Bobby's gang. And to top it off poor Bobby takes two bullets in a shootout and winds up being rushed to the hospital by ambulance--with two lesbian nurses taking care of him.
