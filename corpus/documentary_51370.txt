When the punk movement reached Montreal in 1977 it ignited the passions of a handful of young people who were forever changed by it. Thirty years later some of the players from this momentous time give a surprisingly frank account of their experiences at this key period in their lives-the music and the drugs as well as a burning need to do things differently. The film includes rare archival footage of the Montreal punk scene and features the music of the earliest local punk bands: The 222s The Normals and The Chromosomes.
