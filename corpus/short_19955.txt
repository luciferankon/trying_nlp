This piece starts out with actor Jason Clarke and a behind-the-scenes look at when his character bravely went into the woods to seek out Caesar and ask him for his help. You also get a glimpse of the actors on ladders which later are replaced with horses of course. It's interesting to see how demanding this role was for Jason as he had to interact with no one at times. Things focus next on Toby and they talk about how he even studied chimps. Reeves spends some time talking about how he wanted the humans in the story to be and that of Keri's character and how much she would ground everything in reality.
