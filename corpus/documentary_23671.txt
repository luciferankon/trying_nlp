Beer is one of the oldest beverages humans have produced dating back to at least the fifth millennium BC and recorded in the written history of ancient China and Egypt. The invention of bread and beer has been argued to be responsible for mankind's ability to develop technology and build civilization. Over the last few years the image of beer has changed from a cheap and wide-spread beverage for everyone to an exquisite drink similar to wine mostly because of the trend to go back to the craft of brewing. Even hardcore wine enthusiasts can't resist discovering new flavors and odors in rediscovered beer styles. This is also largely due to the commitment of Michael Jackson - no not that one - but an enthusiastic and humble man from Wetherby/UK known to his friends as just the "Beer Hunter" who brought the knowledge about different beer styles - ranging from Ales to Wit - to millions of followers of his books and TV-series worldwide. The 4-part international TV-series "Beer-tastic!" is paying tribute to his achievements after he sadly passed away in 2007.
