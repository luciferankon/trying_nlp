Omaha has a long-standing problem with gangs and youth-on-youth violence and is one of the most dangerous cities to live in for African American youth. 'I Dream of an Omaha Where . . .' is a collaborative project involving former gang members and people who have been affected by gangs. The project moderated by nationally known performer and writer Daniel Beaty takes the participants through intense and moving workshops to a performance of a play which utilizes the transcripts of the workshops. The 'I Dream' project was a transformative experience for those sharing their stories and is also changing the dialogue in Omaha and similarly affected cities about the nature and impact of gang violence. Most of all it is putting a human face on those who have or still are participating in gangs and the people who have been tragically affected by gang violence.
