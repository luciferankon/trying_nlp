He no longer knows what is real or a dream while the city increasingly reflects the human condition. A young woman wakes up in a hotel room in Shanghai from that dream by a mysterious phone call. A fragmented conversation with a stranger who seems to also be a lover rolls into a dazed odyssey in what seems like another dream amidst nocturnal Shanghai.
