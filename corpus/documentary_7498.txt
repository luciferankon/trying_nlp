A portrait of a strong-willed and unconventional woman who has returned from abroad to live in an arid region of Iran. While the entire nation suffers from drought Atefeh makes every effort to irrigate her farmland. Pushing and pulling sweet-talking and negotiating tough she works with government engineers and workers to lead natural ground water to her fields. Her hard-working energy and independent presence can only hint at how difficult it is to live a solitary life of a widowed woman while her care and taste in home decoration and clothing are delightfully original and charmingly feminine.
