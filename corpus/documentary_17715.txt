Vancouver is one of the most beautiful cities in Canada. Since the day I stepped foot there the beautiful mix of the modern city with the breathtaking natural landscape never seized to amaze me. The entire film was shot during a one year period while I was studying. I am hoping that in the future I will get the opportunity to explore this beautiful world and capture it with my camera.
