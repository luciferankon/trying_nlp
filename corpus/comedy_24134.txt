Spooks abound in this supernatural comedy starring Vhong Navarro as skittish Hesus Resurreccion a man whose ghost-ridden ancestral mansion harbors a portal to the otherworld. Every 100 years the doorway must be opened so it can reveal the identity of "The One" -- the person designated to help usher spirits into the afterlife. Hilarity ensues as scaredy-cat Hesus finds out the chosen one and literally crawls out of his skin with fear.
