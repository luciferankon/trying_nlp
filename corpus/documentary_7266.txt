To commemorate the Bicentennial of Mexican Independence Fomento Cultural Banamex proudly presented the exhibition "Painting of the Kingdoms. Shared Identities in the Hispanic World" which was shown at the Prado Museum and Madrid Royal Palace in 2010 before being sent to Mexico City in 2011. This vast research effort compiled moreover in four volumes tells the story of a profound historic and cultural relationship: one that brings together Spain Mexico and Peru as three nations that formed part of the great Spanish Empire. Thus visual works were exhibited with an aesthetic language that manifests the bonds of identity between these countries as well as the details that distinguish their artistic production from the 16th to 18th centuries. This program bears witness to said exhibition and Fomento Cultural Banamex's genuine interest in the development of Mexican culture.
