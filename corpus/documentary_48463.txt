For the African-Americans of the Colombian Pacific "one who is not black if death". That is their vision of the world. Being isolated from the rest of the world the Blacks of the Pacific have long been devoted to their traditions. These may be the reasons why their music and religion both intrinsically linked are so much alive. For quite a few years now with the opening of a number of small airfields a new wind has been blowing on the pacific coast sometimes taking away some precious gems of the local culture. However some people have been standing claiming how important it is to maintain their cultural traditions often linked to Catholic celebrations.
