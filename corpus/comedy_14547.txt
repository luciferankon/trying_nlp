With Jeremy fresh off the tarmac in Chicago from Los Angeles he and Erika are ready to work through their issues and resurrect the best sketch show you've probably never heard of (but should have). #NightStrife the television series was birthed from a frustration with the lack of African- Americans in televised comedy and what Jeremy and Erika felt was a lack of sophistication of material given to black comedians. With #NightStrife the webseries they decided to create a comedy series like nothing else on YouTube.
