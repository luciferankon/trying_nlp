Bipinchandra breaks family tradition by marrying a city girl Hemangini much to the chagrin of his sister-in-law Kadambini and her husband Navinchandra. Things are delicate even after both women give birth to two children each. Then Hemangini testifies against Navinchandra in Court leading to the division of the property. Things got worse by the arrival of Kadambini's orphaned school-going step-brother Kishan who is beaten and abused by not only by Kadambini and Navinchandra but also by their overweight son. When Hemangini objects to Kishan's ill-treatment Bipin takes the side of the rest of the family and may probably force her to abandon Kishan to his fate or divorce her.
