When Sheriff Jeff Connor of Powder River cannot stop the crime wave his young son Larry writes to the Durango Kid for aid. Taggart the saloon owner is the secret head of the outlaws while Connor's brother Bill is in cahoots with him. Steve Randall the Durango Kid and his pal Smiley Butterbean arrive in time to stop a stagecoach holdup and Steve is made a deputy sheriff. Taggart has one of his men Slade pose as the Durango Kid and while he is speaking to the townspeople the rest of the outlaw gang pillages the town and this somewhat damages the Durango Kid in the eyes of Larry and his sister Doris. Steve suggests that Sheriff Connor visit the government about a railroad project and Taggart instructs Slade and the gang leader to kill Connor on his trip back.
