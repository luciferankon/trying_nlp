Meredith was promised nine years of safety but they only gave her three. Her father who was sent to prison for sexually abusing Meredith and other children in their small town has been released on good behavior. He was supposed to be locked up until Meredith's eighteenth birthday when she could legally be free of both her abusive father and her delusional mother who dwells on a fantasy that the three of them will be a happy family once more. But Meredith is only fifteen and her father is out of prison... And her mother is bringing him home. And Meredith won't let him hurt her or anyone else ever again. No matter what the cost.
