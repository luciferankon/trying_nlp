Back behind the decks after 30 years of obscurity the man whose 70s creations would inspire Aphex Twin and The Chemical Brothers is finally recognised for his groundbreaking contribution to electronica. Bernard Fevre started making electronica in his bedroom in France long before the genre had any place in popular music. He would endure decades of obscurity before a chance discovery of his record in a bargain bin finally brought his contribution to the genre to light. We explore the improbable story of a Frenchman's thirty-year rise to fame his emergence on the British club scene just as he was planning his retirement and the homage paid him by Chemical Brothers and Aphex Twin which would confirm the mastery - and myth - of his extraordinary music.
