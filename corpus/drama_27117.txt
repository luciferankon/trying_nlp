Washed out folk-rock singer Tae-su (Kim Sang-joong) has squandered the last fifteen years of his life in jail due to drug-related charges. Leaving the bars behind he nonchalantly walks into his son Geon-seong's (Kim Heung-soo) house to which the teenager reacts with bitterness and resentment. A smart rational thinker with an excellent academic record Geon-seong made a conscious effort not to follow in his father's footsteps but being his father's son Geon-seong carries a deep passion for music - the only similarity they share. Truce soon knocks on their door in the form of a young confused mother named Mari (YooIn-young) who practically invites herself to their house one day along with her newborn baby. Suddenly laughter fills the house and healing process begins for the three wounded souls. But when Geon-seong learns of his father's drug relapse all hell breaks loose once again.
