Molly hurries to boyfriend Jackson's birthday party with some big news to deliver: She's got an offer for a new job 800 miles away. Jackson says of course he'll follow her anywhere and because it's also Valentine's Day he gives her a diamond pendant. Molly surprises him with a puppy. The romance is soon interrupted with the worst kind of Valentine's gift: Jackson's ex Vanessa shows up with a DNA test proving he's the true father of her baby. Jackson insists that Vanessa was a one-night stand before he and Molly got serious but Molly is livid. She leaves puppy pendant and Jackson in San Francisco and heads for Seattle.
