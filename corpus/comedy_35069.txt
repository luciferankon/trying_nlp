Danton Petar and Andrey work together on the fifth floor of a socialist industrial research institute from the mid-eighties. They are good friends and share everything in their work and private life. Every morning when they come to work take turns watching with binoculars the aerobics exercises of a young girl in the building across the street. Suddenly this routine of their is disturbed - there are rumors that one of them might have to be transferred to a partner institute in Japan. Who should that be? The three friends are now rival and undertake sophisticated underground maneuvers in order to get the prize. They put their friendship at stake. At the end of course it turns out everything has been in vain. The one to go to Japan is the director. At the very end after the grotesque outcome we can see the three friends together again with the binoculars watching at the window.
