Through My Eyes offers honest insight into the realities of Edmonton's at-risk homeless youth. Acclaimed by the Centre for Global Education as providing "a captivating glimpse into the lives of some Edmonton's most vulnerable..." the film profiles homeless and formerly-homeless Edmonton youth telling their stories in their own way in their own words. It also offers the perspective of front-line support providers and others who work directly with at-risk youth. Ultimately Through My Eyes is the story of a city that must to look inside itself to solve a real but not insurmountable problem. In the end it leaves audiences with a profound and inspiring call to action. These kids are homeless not hopeless. What they need most is kindness and consideration - a hand up not a handout. The film was directed and produced by 2 of Edmonton's youngest up-and-coming film makers with the consultation of CEYC subject matter experts homeless and at-risk youth and the public. The City of Edmonton is proud to be a part of this project which aligns with the work of the Mayor's Taskforce to Eliminate Poverty and the 10-year Plan to End Homelessness.
