In 1983 a renowned psychiatrist named Eric Forester was granted permission by the Catholic Church to document and prove the validity of demonic possession. He was assigned several different priests who at the time were investigating people allegedly possessed by demons. The Church hoped that Dr. Foresters expertise in the field of abnormal psychology would determine the authenticity of each case. The project was later titled The Exorcist Chronicles.
