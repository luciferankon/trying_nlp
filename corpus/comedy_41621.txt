Rappin' and tappin' is my game -- comedian Rudy May Moore introduces himself to an enthusiastic audience in this stand-up performance recorded at a club in the 1980s. Raunchy bedroom and bathroom humor mixes with rhythmic and rhyming stories about archetypal folk heroes Dolemite and Shine. Moore throws in sets of one liners - "My brother is so dumb that..." and "She's so ugly that..." plus presidential candidate Dolemite fields questions from the crowd. Moore punctuates his routines with the refrain "I ain't lying." Between Moore's sets comics Leroy and Skillet do some entertaining.
