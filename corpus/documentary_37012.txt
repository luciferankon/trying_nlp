This documentary explores the reasons why a young aboriginal woman tries to hold on to her culture and how she manages to do so when her grandfather's death removes her most important connection to First Nations traditions. After the death of her grandfather Sonia tries to understand why she knows so little about Mohawk culture and especially about what it means to be Mohawk today. Last Call Indien is not only a search for identity but a pretext for analyzing the situation of the latest generation of status Indians. It's a personal struggle against the loss of a culture an intimate quest that anyone whose origins lie in two different cultures can identify.
