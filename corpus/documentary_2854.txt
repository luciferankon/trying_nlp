Alberto De Agostini salesian priest from Italy went to Patagonia in 1910 as missionary but became also famous as explorer climber photographer. He conquered unknown lands and described them thoroughly books and films. He is remembered in Chile and Argentina as one of the most important figures in the history of the Magellanic lands. He was the first one who understood the touristic potential of this part of the world. The climber Enrico Rosso who has organized through more than twenty years six expeditions in Patagonia has followed his deeds: since the early school years from the Alps to the salesian schools in Piedmont to his activity as missionary who protected and studied the last indigenous people of Patagonia and Terra del Fuoco to his very important discoveries of fjords mountains and glaciers over more than forty years of explorations.
