Giffoni Film Festival is founded in 1971 by Claudio Gubitosi to promote and develop cinema for children. The format of the festival centers on the jury being composed entirely of children. Therefore the jury selection is in fact the children's' selection. In his 1982 visit to the festival Francois Truffaut complimented in his letter that "Of all the festivals Giffoni is the most necessary". For 6 years now GFF has created a network of festivals in the world under the Giffoni World Alliance using the same format to promote films for children around the planet. Giffoni Hollywood is a testimony to the success of this format. Robert De Niro Oliver Stone Meryl StreepJeremy Irons John Travolta Wim Wenders Ben Kingsley Kathy Bates Krzystof Kieslowsky Roman Polanski Danny De Vito are just a few of the stars that have been guests to the festival in its 38 years of activity. The complete list includes practically the most important writers actors/actresses directors and producers of Italian cinema in the last 4 decades.
