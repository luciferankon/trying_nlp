A couple Irvin and Ida get ready for a night at the opera. Their clothes are elegant their conversation oddly stilted. Where do they actually go? On other nights they celebrate Halloween - she as Marilyn Monroe he as Elvis - and Thanksgiving. Sometimes they argue sometimes they sit companionably. What is the nature of their relationship? Irvin thinks a lot about his mother; Ida remembers her father with longing. Ida talks of leaving. Irvin's memories take on qualities of hallucination. Can either break free?
