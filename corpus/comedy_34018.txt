A vet cures the animals but when he goes to a farm to care for a calving cowhe is asked to examine the whole family from the patriarch ("he's always coughing") to the youngest brat ;the butcher's wife brings him a leg of lamb just for a piece of (medical) advice.Although he insists he is not a physician all people around treat him as a true doctor .And when he (accidentally) heals a famous starevery one wants his consultation.To put the Medical Association off the trackall the patients are asked to bring their pet with themand the "vet" is supposed to talk to the so called sick animal.Unfortunately a true (female) physician has just arrived in town and she is not prepared to accept it.
