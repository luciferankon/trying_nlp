On the deserted moors a traveler wakes up in the middle of the road. He has no recollection of how he got there or where he is. Trying to get his bearings he visits a farm whose inhabitants are at best unhelpful. Making his way home he tries to remember where he is and how he got there. Blackout shows the tension of an unfamiliar place and demonstrates how in search for reason not everything is what it seems.
