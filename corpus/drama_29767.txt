From the moment I was born I cried for a month... Eighteen years on and Justin is no nearer the truth. And in a world that increasingly doesn't care maybe just simply relying on friendship is not enough? Especially with friends like Billy Sean and Tommy. Set amongst the backdrop of the towering concrete-clad estates of south London 'Zebra Crossings' blends a diverse mixture of characters that all share one thing in common: The incredible loneliness of living alongside 7 million other people. Blending the surreal and very real we take an intense journey in search of friendship belief and religion. With a lacklustre father and estranged mother Justin's only source of perennial control comes from an unlikely source his bed-ridden sister Suzanne. But Justin needs is a real mentor a father figure someone who can provide guidance before it's all too late. In steps Marcus unlike anyone Justin has ever known before calm soft assured - but does he want something from Justin? Meanwhile Tommy's abandonment issues haunt him once again and his class-A drug addiction has sent him into full destruction mode. Also the pressure from a rival gang has reached exploding point - as there is certainly no space for two crews in this neighbourhood. Justin must find the answer to it all and quick.
