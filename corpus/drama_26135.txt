The story is minimal; love lost love regained love destroyed. Our characters are Caleb and Rin. Caleb lives comfortably in his upper/middle class lifestyle as a columnist and blogger. Rin is a prominent student filmmaker in the gay community at his college. Their lives intertwine when Caleb's wife is killed in an accidental hit and run and Caleb's only memory of the accident is a bumper sticker of a one legged bird. The two develop a relationship that opens up Caleb's world to a new meaning of love but transcends into dangerous and destructive when he begins to suspect Rin had something to do with his accident. The film is told in four intertwining storylines shot in four different film styles respectively; Melodrama French New Wave Mumblecore (or 'Indie') and Documentary which will actually feature real interviews from notable members of Minnesota's GLBT community. FAUX takes place during America's current perceptions of sexuality; specifically the gay rights movement. It will center on Minneapolis's own GLBT community and shall offer insight as well as provoke thought. But as this is the focal point it will also embody a broader philosophy disseminating ideologies of narrative time and history as well as cultural concepts of sexuality and 'humanism' in the modern American capital. The film aims to approach sexuality in cinema from a typically untouched agenda. This isn't a movie about gays straights blacks whites bad guys or good guys; this is a movie about people; this is a movie about human beings.
