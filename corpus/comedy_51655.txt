The citizens form vigilance committees but when Kleinman has dressed his neighbors have disappeared. Meanwhile a circus has come to town. Irmy and Paul are two of the artists. After a fight Irmy leaves the circus in the middle of the night. Eventually she meets Kleinman scared and alone. It's the middle of a dark and foggy night. Max Kleinman is awaken from a deep sleep by a group of men wanting him to join their lynch mob to capture a serial murderer who only seems to strike when foggy and who primarily murders by strangulation with a wire cord. Kleinman is included within the plan even though he is largely treated as a schmuck by those that know him the members of the mob who don't even tell him what his role in the plan is despite his repeated requests. In his wanderings through the dark and foggy streets he encounters many people most notably a young innocent named Irmy. A sword swallower with a traveling circus in town Irmy left both the circus and her boyfriend Paul one of the circus clowns not only because she wants to have a baby and he doesn't but because she caught him cheating on her. Irmy's own wanderings through the streets to find a place to sleep for the night takes her to many places including a brothel. In addition to their initial goals of capturing the murderer and finding a place to sleep for the night Kleinman and Irmy discover that their time together may bring up larger issues in their life. However they may not only end up being attempted targets of the murderer but Kleinman in particular may be a convenient scapegoat for what end up being the competing lynch mobs who want to see someone - anyone - pay for the murders with his own life.
