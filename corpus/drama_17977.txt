Cicada is the story of Jumpei-- a man who loses sight of his progeny when he finds out he is infertile but then is given the gift of clairvoyance and begins to see glimpses of the future. These glimpses lead him to a series of cicada shells which become symbolic of his desire to shed his old self. Though his lineage ends with himself Jumpei starts anew as a father-figure to his sister's young son.
