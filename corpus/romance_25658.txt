Frank married 60's emerges from the city streets that teem with pedestrians whose brief conversations reveal they are all in the chase for love. Frank joins the chase too as he pursues Reyna a Mexican-American escort 40's also married. In the course of their encounter each tries to turn the other into their mate. They fail. At dawn on Valentine's Day Frank tells Paula his wife of 30 years his dream that night of a catastrophe that claimed both their lives. As they were dying he told her in the dream: "I'm glad it was you that I married." Paula makes him repeat that. He does. They open to each other. In the last scene Reyna again crosses Frank's path.
