An elderly Tuareg man predicts that none of his people will still be living as nomads in fifty years' time. The Tuareg people speak of their hardships their distaste for city living and the nomad's fierce love of liberty and open spaces. Extraordinary feats break in too: an invasion of locusts the castration of an angry adult camel and the inspection of a well bottom by a man dangling from 65-metre ropes. The rhythms dramas and personalities of a family a way of life and a place.
