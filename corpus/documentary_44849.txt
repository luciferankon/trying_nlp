In the Olduvai Gorge in Tanganyika 'Louis Leakey' (qv)'s expedition found the skull of the World's earliest known Man. By chance the 'Armand Denis (I)' (qv) camera team were there to make a unique film record of this discovery now to be screened for the first time. The programme begins with the story of Man's search for his fossil ancestors told by 'Kenneth Oakley (III)' (qv) of the British Museum of Natural History 'John Russell Napier' (qv) of the Royal Free Hospital Medical School and by film from South Africa China and Europe.
