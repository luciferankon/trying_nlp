Paul Hogan opens the door to his private and public life. Joining him and asking the questions we all want to ask is his good friend Shane Jacobson. Together they talk life love and comedy. It's been 40 years since he first stepped into the comedy limelight and now at 73 he is ready to share - warts-and-all - his story with fellow comedian Shane Jacobson (Kenny The Time of our Lives). This relaxed candid and hilarious program charts his journey from raising a family in a housing commission home to the highs of Crocodile Dundee the Golden Globe Awards and performing stand-up at the Oscars. It also delves into the lows of Hogan's battle with the Australian Tax Office. And right now Paul Hogan is once again set to do what he does best - entertain.
