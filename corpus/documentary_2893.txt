A hand with a camera emerges from a lake. This surreal scene is like a period in the personal correspondence between two Japanese filmmakers. In the director's mind the faded 8mm footage depicts artifacts that evoke phantoms of the past. But besides aimless wanderings through the streets of his hometown a collection of photographs of a women's wrestling team or the handmade mask of Mexican superhero El Santa the camera also shows its own image. In this experimental correspondence written with a camera instead of a pen the central theme is one of mirrors and reflections representing the connection between subject and object life and film.
