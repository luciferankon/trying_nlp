This film is the story of the cold and calculated slaughter of 22000 Polish Army Officers and civilian professionals at the hands of the Soviet NKVD predecessor of the dreaded KGB ... the attempts to place the blame on the Nazis ... the overwhelming evidence pointing to Moscow and Stalin ... the cover-up ... ...and the silence. These are the contours of a crime incomprehensible among so-called civilized nations and the complex conspiracy of three governments to conceal it.
