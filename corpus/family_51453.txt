The film centres on a school trip to Conwy Castle in North Wales. Mrs. Kay teaches a remedial class for illiterate children called the "Progress Class". The whole class - along with Digga and Reilly the slightly older class bullies who used to be in the Progress Class - are taken on a coach trip. In the original version the headmaster Mr Briggs makes the decision to go on the trip as an extra member of staff emphasising his mistrust of the liberal values of Mrs Kay. However in the shorter stage version the Headteacher commissions Mr. Briggs the authoritarian Deputy Headmaster to supervise the trip.
