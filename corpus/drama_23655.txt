Adapted from Toby Barlow's book Sharp Teeth is an extraordinarily moving passionate and violent Los Angeles-based tale of unrequited love involving rival white collar gangs that just happen to be able to turn into wild primal dogs that run at night in the Southern California arroyos. Filled with passion wrenched apart by unrequited love Sharp Teeth is the compelling violent yet deeply moving story of rival Los Angeles gangs (but think Robert De Niro's intelligently structured gang in the movie Heat not some bunch of fools) who just happen to be able to transform themselves into wolves and wild dogs who run in the canyons and arroyos of Southern California's nighttime wilderness. In the criminal hinterlands of Los Angeles the LAPD investigates a spate of ferocious gangland killings. Undercover cop Anthony following a clue trail leading to local dog pounds is about to stray into darker and more sinister territory than his most terrifying nightmares.
