September 1980. Mustafa 'Mehmet Ali Alabora' and his wife who're both laborers are married for 5 years. The couple has nothing to do with politics and spend their days happily with their 3 year old daughter and their TV despite the clamor of guns clashing outside every night. One Friday morning they wake up and hear the voice of Hasan Mutlucan on radio and observe soldiers marching through the streets the very confirmation of the military coup that has taken place. Arrests begin instantly in workplace and neighborhood. Yet Mustafa far from being disturbed assumes that all apprehensions must have rightful reasons. Until the night he's taken into custody charged with the crimes of a militant code named "Sehmuz".
