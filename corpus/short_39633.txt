Experimental film inspired by JG BALLARD's THE DROWNED GIANT. Divided in three chapter the film deals with the themes of death decay and architecture. Music by glynne Cicada. Playing with the original language and the idea of a visual anatomical/biological grammar the captions are extracts from the original short story. Decontextualized or random words are sometimes inserted to toy with the idea of copyrighting
