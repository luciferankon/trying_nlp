Comic Strip follows the lives of four friends and the Atomic Arrow as they make their way through the comic book community. Each episode shows the real world gang trying to balance their day jobs and social lives while navigating through the wild world of conventions fans and running a comic book business. All their adventures are reflected in interspersed comic panels from the newest issue. The Atomic Arrow will tackle new thrilling action each week. Whether it's love or an epic battle it just goes to show that any little thing we do could be what's behind each "BANG! POW! Or ZOOM!" of a super hero's world.
