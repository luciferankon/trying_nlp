The elders of the village gather and decide who they will assign the roles. The elders decide to give John the role of the Patriarcheas son Michelis the role of Peter in Giannakos the role of Magdalen in Katerina the harlot of the village the role of Judas in Panagiotaros and finally the role of Christ in the most an innocent man who was none other than the shepherd of the sheep of Patriarcheas Manolios. Then refugees arrive from a distant village that the Turks looted and try to find a place to settle down with what valuable things they managed to get with them. Their chief is a priest Papa-Fotis. Unfortunately the inhabitants of Lykovrisi drove them instigated by Papa-Grigoris not to let them stay because they found that one of the refugee women had cholera. Manolios however with Giannakos Michelis and the other "apostles" tells them to go to Sarakina where there are caves to stay there. But the dealers do not want them either.
