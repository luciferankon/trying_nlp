A comedy talk show hosted by Mitchi (Boris Mitchell) and Vlad the Russian Lion (Dante Zuccaro). The pair talk about current events and often have clashing opinions on certain topics. There are additional segments they introduce including one hosted by Vlad's former fraternity brother Colby Beaver (Dante Zuccaro). The show is comic in nature but the hosts also aim to make legitimate points and arguments on topics.
