There is something that I must say to my people...This is Our Hope! (Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 28 August 1963). During the U.S. Civil Rights Movement leaders within the American Jewish community including several Holocaust survivors stood side-by-side with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and leaders within the African-American community of various faiths who were committed to non-violent social change. Just as he believed in The United States of America and a just peace for all Americans Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. believed in Israel and a just peace between Jews and Arabs Jews and Muslims Israelis and Palestinians.
