While everyone in the Gandhi family has fallen for Montu's charm Hasmukh sees him for the trickster he is. Not wanting his daughter to be entrapped Hasmukh has found the perfect boy for her; one who is not only trustworthy but also someone he knows will take care of her. The trouble is no one approves of his choice. Bakul Buch Hasmukh's hardworking manager has always had a soft spot for Tanisha but has never been brave enough to talk to any woman let alone Tanisha.

What begins then is the most bizarre gujju love story ever told with lies spies underworld dons and a curious case of a gold bracelet. Will Bakul manage to win over Tanisha?
