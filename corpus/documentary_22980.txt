Francisco Sanchez: Paco de Lucia is the definitive documentary on the myth of the flamenco guitar. It not only provides information about his life and musical art but it also offers a previously unknown intimate portrait of the artist than makes us 'feel' and understand the human being beneath the world wide known genius. Retired in the Mexican jungle Paco de Luc√≠a shows in this program his creative doubts the reasons for his silence and other secrets of his genius. It is the first time that the 'master' invites a television team to share with him a world tour and allows it to record his daily life in Mexico and his meetings with other artists like Chick Corea.
