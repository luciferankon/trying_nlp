It's Roundup Day at the Ranch the biggest day of the year when all the neighbors come to help gather the cattle. As Head of Ranch Security it is Hank's job (he thinks) to run the roundup. But when the neighbors arrive Hank notices a new face among them: a cowdog named Benny. Unbeknownst to Hank High Loper has asked his friend Jimmy a cowboy and dog trainer to bring one of his cowdogs for a demonstration. Hank soon learns that Benny has come to interview for a job... his job. When Loper sidelines Hank by tying him up to the yard gate Hank has to watch as the cowboys ride out with Benny instead of him. But just when it seems that Hank's day couldn't get worse along comes Pete the Barncat. Seeing that Hank is demoralized and vulnerable Pete takes the opportunity to taunt Hank. Furious and unable to control himself Hank lunges against the rope at Pete. But then something unexpected happens. The rope comes loose! Hank sends Pete up the tree and then turns his attention back to Benny. When Benny and the cowboys try to bring in the cattle Hank makes his stand in the middle of the gate to the corrals and stampedes the herd. But his plan backfires and he finds himself fleeing from a furious High Loper. As the cowboys rush off to re-gather the herd Hank finally grasps the error of his actions and sets out to leave the ranch in humiliation. But as he's leaving he encounters Benny who is out trying to re-gather the herd. When Hank hears a distant call for help Benny lets slip that he abandoned Loper in quicksand in order to complete his mission of gathering the cattle. Shocked and outraged by Benny's callousness Hank dashes to the creek to save the man who took away his job. When Hank gets there he finds Loper and his horse sinking in quicksand. He has to summon all of his courage willpower and physical strength to pull Loper out of the quicksand and save his life.
