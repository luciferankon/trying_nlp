In Search of... Ghosts is the second in a series of videos based on the '70s TV show hosted by Leonard Nimoy investigating supernatural and paranormal phenomena. The show was revived in 2010 by the artist Matthew Day Jackson. In Search of... Ghosts opens with amateur video footage of an alleged ghost sighting in the National Air Force Museum in Dayton Ohio and expands from that perspective to consider the ghost phenomenon in a variety of historical and contemporary contexts. Clips from Laurence Olivier's Hamlet are included in order to illustrate the classic ghost visitation and the history of ghost hunting is summarized. Ghosts are considered in the context of the Hiroshima bombing and a visit is paid to the Nevada National Security Site where the Apple II house built in the 1950s in order to test the effects of a nuclear blast still stands today a haunted house for all the world or all the world's haunted houses. The episode features interviews with paranormal investigator Matt Moniz and historian Martin Sherwin.
