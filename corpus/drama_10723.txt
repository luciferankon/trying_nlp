Only a seven-passenger motor and $100 to be spent exclusively for gasoline or repairs was Arnold Baird's share of his father's property. Light-hearted by nature Baird made the most of his legacy and started a "jitney bus" line. When James Bennett general manager of the Consolidated Traction Co. learned Baird had been practically cut off in his father's will he informed Baird that his daughter would never marry a pauper and to go out and make his fortune. Bennett's decision suited Mrs. Bennett who was eager to shine in society and planned to gain her ends by marrying Ruth to Wm. Mott-Smith who controlled the traction company. When Ruth got the chance to tell Mr. Mott-Smith what she thought of him she left no room for doubt. Ruth met Baird secretly and she was first to know of Baird's jitney-bus plans. Israel Helmstone leader of organized labor decided that the employees of the Consolidated Traction Co. deserved an increase in pay. Bennett refused Helmstone's demands and the labor leader called Baird into consultation. Helmstone's daughter Wanda employed as stenographer by Mr. Mott-Smith furnished inside information that showed the weakness of Bennett's defense. The car strike was called and traffic paralyzed. The next morning the "Social Rapid Transit Company" sprang into operation. Mott-Smith Bennett and their associates were filled with consternation. Baird's pals in society entered their cars for public patronage and "jitney bused" the traction company to its knees. When strike-breakers were called in there was nobody to ride for the public preferred the limousines. When Bennett cried for mercy Baird was the intermediary. Fate decreed that Baird should be the one to rush to Mott-Smith's office to rescue Wanda Helmstone from the clutches of the drunken society leper. Settling with Bennett was no hard matter for Baird. His terms were $10000 a year for becoming assistant general manager and six months' vacation to enjoy a honeymoon on which Ruth was to be the bride.
