Newfoundland's barren windswept shores made a secluded home for the island's indigenous people the Beothuk --until the outside world arrived. By the 1600s tens of thousands of migratory fishermen were flocking to Newfoundland. More Europeans were familiar with the island than with any other place in the New World. For centuries the Newfoundland fishery was a factor in European politics and in European wars. These dark tumultuous years brought failed colonies marauding pirates violent battles and finally the decimation of the Beothuk people. In this first film explore remnants of the lost colonies of Avalon and Plaisance (now Placentia) which are only now being uncovered; the traces of early French fishing stations; Harbour Grace -- home to Pirate Peter Easton; and other places and stories that have vanished in the mists of time.
