This film is about Ahmad Donish (1827-1897) poet artist mathematician astronomer educator and philosopher who lived in the second half of the 19th century in Bukhara. He is the first Tadjik who sought to reform in Bukhara through education. He was nominated as secretary for a delegation to St. Peterburg and during his time made three trips to Russia which expended his knowledge and world view. Based on those trips he considered both the traditional Islamic and the new European models and advanced the democratic ideas between the Bukhara Emirate and Russia. He was the first who stressed the need for modern knowledge in contemporary life as well as the need for political and education reforms in Bukhara. The film reflects the time during ruled Emir Musaffar (1860-1885) where Ahmad Donish was appointed as the delegation's consultant (1869-1970) in St. Petersburg to reestablish ties between Emir and Russia. To accomplish those historical events of traveling Ahmad Donish from Bukhara to St. Petersburg Russia the film was made by two USSR film studios working in collaboration with each other Tajikfilm (based in Dushanbe Tadjikistan) and Lenfilm (based in St. Petersburg Russia).
