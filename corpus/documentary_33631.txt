Immigration from the sub-Saharan regions of Africa was seen as a temporary phenomenon in the 70's. Since then it has become a social reality represented by the new black African population in Catalonia: Black Catalans or Catalan Blacks. The new population is composed of the parents who arrived from Africa; their children already born in Catalonia and -on many occasions- their grandchildren. Quite often the second and third generation keep a complex not easy relationship with their parents and also with the country where they all live now and their people. This documentary reflects on the difficult issue of identity from the testimonies and experience of several sub-Saharan immigrants in Catalonia.
