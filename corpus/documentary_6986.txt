It's the biggest construction project in Calgary's history. A new international terminal that doubles the size of the airport. A new runway the longest in country stretching nearly three miles. Price tag - two billion dollars. It will open up new direct flights to half the world. Turning Calgary into a Western Canadian hub for business tourism and cargo. The city and the province of Alberta will never be the same. But the clock is ticking and if the project runs late the cost jumps by three million dollars a day.
