This English sitcom is about Terry Gary James and Patrick four Londoners who remained best friends and confidants past their sexual prime married or even divorced some with children but still with a natural appetite for the ladies no longer physically first choice but disposing of sufficient means (financial and socially as they are successful in their respective professions) to be quite attractive; alas the wisdom of experience often proves somewhat illusory.
