The best man at an upcoming wedding goes to a jeweler to pick up the wedding ring and is also given a bracelet on approval worth $25000. On his way home a pigeon swoops down and snags the bracelet. The man must track down the pigeon and get the bracelet back so he won't have to pay for it--but that's easier said than done.
