During the Iraqi-Iranian war which started in 1980 and lasted for eight years a Muslim family in a Kurdish village received from the government the corpse of their son who had been killed in the war. When they were preparing for the funeral they discovered that the corpse was not circumcised and they had doubts that it was their son. Once they told their Christian neighbors about that the problem grew as each family claimed the body was their son.
