Khleifi interviews nine inter-faith and inter-racial couples in Israel asking each where they met how they have addressed religious or cultural differences in their marriage how their families have responded to the relationship and how they chose where to live. He also has a professor and three religious leaders comment: a sheikh a rabbi and a priest. The three religious spokesmen are dead set against inter-faith marriage while the couples express themselves in simple terms about their partner's kindness and other human qualities.
