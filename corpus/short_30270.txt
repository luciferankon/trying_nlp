The film opens on an extreme close up of an eye ball (the windows to the soul). We are soon shown a series of scattered memories portraying an apparently happy couple. After seeing the happy times we realise that the female of the relationship is troubled. This is confirmed when we see her death by slitting her wrists. The man must then question how he can go on and whether to join her or not.
