Through cases of lost time (whenever he switches to another alter he loses time) and through conversations with his best friend Cooper he learns that his 'episodes' are impacting his life. The movie takes the audience through Nathan's daily life until he is unexpectedly accused of beating his girlfriend (Nathan does not have a girlfriend) Marley.
