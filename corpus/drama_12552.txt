Azam comes back to his village and looks for his childhood friend Ali. Ali and his wife Minah invites Azam for fishing and a mid night picnic on a small island. Towards the end of the night they have a game of holding breath underwater for 3 minutes and Azam is never seen again... The plot also tells the childhood time of the returning character. His son also aspires to leave for Kuala Lumpur. Although one needs to point out that the film's audio-visual influence is mostly derived from the presence of the ocean in fluctuating. This creates a hypnotic tranquility that also guides the mysterious mythical undertones of the movie.
