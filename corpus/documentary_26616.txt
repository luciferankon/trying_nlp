The story of Angels In Scrubs is all at once beautiful heart wrenching healing and simply difficult to tell. It all started in March 2008 when a little girl was born to first time parents. Little is an understatement. She weighed in at 1 pound 7 ounces and was 11.5 inches long. She was born at 25 weeks gestation and was sick from the day she left the womb. This is the story of a beautiful child and the world she changed around her. This is the story of Carly. While this documentary focuses on her struggles & triumphs it also opens up the world of the doctors and nurses that care for children like Carly day in and day out. Why & how do they do what they do? Watch as bonds are formed laughter is shared and tears are shed. Watch as medical staff members become family members. Watch these Angels In Scrubs perform miracles every day. The film was shot over the course of Carly's stay at the University of Utah Medical Center NBICU.
