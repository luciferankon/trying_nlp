Christian isn't your average street fighter. Not only does he have to fight for his respect but he also fights because he is good. He has been trained by the streets because that is all he really knows. He didn't graduate from high school and lacked the support and motivation to do anything different for most of his life. Then one day his world changed. He meet a woman who loved him and saw way more potential in him. This begins to cause a riff in the relationship between himself and his best friend Joe. Christian starts to see more in himself. He wants to change his life and decided to live a more fulfilling life; a life that has love in it. Christian's problem is that many people don't want him to change because they have placed him in a box and they don't want him to come out. People have begun to make money betting on Christian and other fighters want to be like him but he is changing and everyone can notice it. He attempts to get a "normal" job but without trained skills he is somehow pulled right back into the underground fight scene. His girlfriend ends up getting kidnapped by those same people that want to keep him down and now he has to fight the fight of his life to get his girl back and find himself in the process.
