Our aim with Beauty Bites Beast is to 'normalize' the idea of women's self-defense - and by extension kids' self-defense - as a human need and right. We want to inspire those on the fence to see that the drive to protect oneself is not a gendered attribute and to thereby get behind the movement to make empowerment self-defense accessible portable and affordable. Think of the women and girls you know and love: they can be any age friends co-workers or family. Now... consider the fact that 1/3rd of all women and girls worldwide are assaulted during their lifetime. That means one of every three females you know personally most likely has been attacked and chances are they didn't fight back. Why is this when females of other species would? "Beauty Bites Beast" sets out to answer this question and vanquish the barriers to teaching women and girls unarmed verbal and physical empowerment self-defense while focusing on some of the surprising benefits: confidence leadership and self-esteem. Journey with Ellen Snortland -- journalist author and activist -- as she explores the many myths and misunderstandings that surround women learning to defend themselves. The film highlights groups of women from different parts of the world as they embark on one of the most transformational experience of their lives: learning full-force full-impact self-defense that uses what ALL human beings already have: their brains voices and bodies. As one participant states "I am alive today because I fought." You will hear from experts in law enforcement social work education law and more as they address the resistance and opposition to women's self-defense as well as those who advocate that verbal and physical self-defense for women should be as universally accepted and available as swimming lessons.
