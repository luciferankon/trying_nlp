Under the influence of liquor and power they often pick-up girls to satiate their libido and ego. But in one such incidents their rape victim turns out to be Jeetu's sister. Jeetu one of the team mates admires and worships Guddu Bhai their leader. What happens to them after this is rather more shocking and sensational.
