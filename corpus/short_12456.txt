Bush at the 2004 Army/Navy football game in Philadelphia a demolition derby in Maryland just months after 9/11 wrestling in a small-town in Mexico a Prospect Park contest between football players and birds kids playing basketball before Sunday service in North Carolina found footage and TV coverage of the start of the current war in Iraq SPORTS is an attempt to get at some truths about how political perceptual and personal realities have come to be shaped by the Big Game.
