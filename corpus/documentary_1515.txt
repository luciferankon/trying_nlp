A dedicated group of Iranian lawyers and activists work together to counter the injustice of the death penalty. In Iran this means risking everything to mount 'Stop Stoning Forever' a campaign to end the practice of execution by stoning and to lessen this practice's impact on women in Iran. Women in Shroud is an in-depth look into the stoning of women who are found guilty of adultery in Iran. The film demonstrates the efforts of women's rights groups and campaigners who work day and night to put an end to these executions by demanding the abolishment of the associated laws in the Iranian Islamic Penal Code. Women in Shroud was the recipient of the prestigious Sundance Institute Documentary Grant and Jan Vrijman Fund. Cinema for Peace presented Farid Haerinejad with their Justice Award along with Mohammad Reza Kazemi for co-directing this film (Berlin 2010). It also has received "Special Mention" from One World FF Brussels 2010. On occasion of Human Rights Day in 2009 Women in Shroud was screened at the Senate of Canada for an audience of ambassadors honourable justices senators and members of the Parliament. Women in Shroud has since been screened in various foreign-office venues and embassies around the world helping raise much needed international awareness about the issue of stoning in Iran.
