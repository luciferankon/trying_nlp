A logging company enters the indigenous community of Beni in Bolivia and begins logging. They hire local people make promises of the benefits they will receive but the Indians gradually become aware of the logging company's deceptions and rapacious behavior and they drive them out. This marks the beginning of the Indigenous Rights Movement in Beni.
