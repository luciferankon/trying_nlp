Beautiful girls are in danger. At Sunny Beach a huge shark is waiting for his prey. College students Miki and Mai arrive on a private beach on a tropical island. They can't find the hotel where they booked their reservations and have gotten hopelessly lost until a handsome young man shows up offering to take them to his lodge. But something is not right about the place. The owner's fingernails are tainted with blood and Miki feels something sinister lurking nearby. In Japan Scientists for the last couple of decades have been doing research on Megalodon the Ancestor to that of Charcaradon Carcarius aka The Great White Shark. It turns out that they are having success and have been raising one that was cloned from a Megalodon's DNA and the DNA was genetically programmed into the eggs of a Great White Shark Female and that egg was placed in a artificial womb where it was allowed to grow then when it was born it was placed in a extraordinarily oversized tank. However the Shark has found a way to escape from the tank and get into the Sea of Japan. Now being a new shark and all it's very hungry and it needs some very real meals!
