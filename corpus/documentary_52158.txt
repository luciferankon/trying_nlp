Walter Benjamin expressed the vanishing of the verbal form of storytelling in his 1936 essay. Following Benjamin's description of a storyteller we are looking at the storyteller of today. The selected protagonists are: architects Peter Eisenman and Nikolaus Hirsch artists Özge Açikkol & Seçil Yersel Simon Starling Nikolay Polisski fakir Lalu Baba activist Ali Shamsher. Their effort shows that behind each of the works there stands a personal experience absorbing the experiences of many. Relived again and again it determines the practices of one's life. Today's storyteller be it an artist or an architect presents a possibility to share the experience without words. He makes visible and tangible for us that which remains inexistent for the media and the commerce.
