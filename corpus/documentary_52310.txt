George W. Bush 43rd President of the United States had a storybook life before arriving in office via a contentious 2000 election. Many Americans however are unaware of who or more importantly what Bush pretends not to be: a very wealthy extremely well-connected northeastern Yankee blueblood. Fortunately six months prior to the 2004 election documentary filmmaker Marc Berlin discovered someone who did know these things: Vernon Craig. Distantly related to the Bush's and victim of a Dubya sucker-punch outside a New Haven bar in 1968 Craig agreed to be interviewed about his extensive knowledge of and connection to the Bush-Walker dynasty. Guiding us to those elite places and institutions which played a role in forming George W.'s right-wing politics--from the sprawling Walker estate in Kennebunkport to Phillips Academy in Andover Massachusetts and finally the ivied walls of Yale University and Skull and Bones--Vernon Craig "The Man Who Knew Bush" wryly explains what George W. Bush is and how precisely he became the most powerful man in the world.
