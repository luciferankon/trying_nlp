During the 1990s David Lee Hoffman searched throughout China for the finest teas. He's a California importer who as a youth lived in Asia for years and took tea with the Dali Lama. Hoffman's mission is to find and bring to the U.S. the best hand picked and hand processed tea. This search takes him directly to farms and engages him with Chinese scientists business people and government officials: Hoffman wants tea grown organically without a factory high-yield mentality. By 2004 Hoffman has seen success: there are farmers' collectives selling tea ways to export "boutique tea" from China and a growing Chinese appreciation for organic farming's best friend the earthworm.
