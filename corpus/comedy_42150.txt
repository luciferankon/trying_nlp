A wretched guy Spyros wants to marry off his sister Marianna a lively little hussy. He wants to give her an apartment for her dowry but doesn't have enough money for something like that. Thus he is forced to ask for a loan from his boss. The latter refuses to help him but as soon as he meets Marianna in person (who in the meantime has been elected "Miss Peacock" and stars in a film) changes his mind. Spyros tries to talk some sense into Marianna who is being groomed to be the boss's lover but the only thing he achieves is to lose his job. Being a good chemist however he manages to find another position right away; but his original problem still stands. He wants at any cost to settle his sister by marrying her to the poor and honest electrician Manolis who as it seems loves her very much.
