Hungry for a new body and awaiting in every shadow lurks Evil's Edge. Worshiped and surrounded by a family of wickedness made up of all walks of life there could be no escaping it. With a sword serving as the finger tip of Satan himself world destruction is at hand. Those who worship him will be saved and those who do not will be sacrificed.
