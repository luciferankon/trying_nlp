The Comsat Angels were initially active from 1978 to 1995 with basically this line-up. Named after the J. G. Ballard short story. They debuted in 1979 with the "Red Planet" three-track single. This release attracted Polydor A&R man Frank Neilson and the band signed a three-album recording contract. These three albums - "Waiting for a Miracle" (1980) which included the single "Independence Day" probably their best known song "Sleep No More" (1981) and "Fiction" (1982) - are regarded by some as their best but only sold modestly. They then signed with Jive Records and recorded "Land" (1983) which had a more commercial new wave-oriented sound. And so on - Considered a very serious act distinctive goal-oriented and predecessors of their craft they never achieved the coveted position of independence and unrest.
