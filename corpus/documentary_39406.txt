Moritz Daniel Oppenheim "the painter of the Rothschilds & the Rothschild of painters" was not only the first Jewish artist with an academic background but also an icon of Jewish emancipation in Germany. Together with his bestseller - the depictions on traditional Jewish family life - the great achievements of 19th century German Jewry fell into oblivion. Young filmmaker Isabel Gathof is seeking Oppenheim's traces - motifs descendants and heritage - in Germany France and Israel on the occasion of the world's first monument set up for the artist. Imposing images show the becoming of this great man and blur the lines between the past and the present on two narrative levels.
