First grader Lesch (Alex) is left alone in the family apartment. It is his first taste of independence and he's very happy to spend time alone as he sees it as his first step towards adulthood. Unfortunately some neighboring boys upset his plans by inviting themselves around intending on using Lesch's apartment to rehearse a play they are intending on performing.
