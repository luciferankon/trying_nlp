Sunset Academy is the only private boarding school located in Sunny City. It's an experimental school accepting students from all over the United States that "couldn't make it" in their current public schools. Whether the student suffered social rejection through acts of violence segregation or stereotyping Sunset Academy is blending them under one roof in hopes that the positive environment encourages peace and growth. But will this common ground be enough to give the students a new sense of freedom and structure or will their many differences become a recipe for disaster?
