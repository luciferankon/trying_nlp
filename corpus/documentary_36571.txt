The black kite generally referred to as 'the eagle' in Taiwan. However it has now become so rare that very few people ever get to see it. Shen Zhen-Zhong better known as 'Mr. Kite' vowed to safeguard this endangered bird and spent the best 20 years of his life traveling throughout Taiwan to find out why the black kite is disappearing. From 1992 to 2015 film documentary maker Liang Chieh-Te followed Mr. Kite's journey. Through his camera lenses he has recorded the story of how because of love one person can cross the species barrier and totally devote himself to a cause with no regrets.
