He is carrying addresses of underground printing offices contact points etc. to sympathizers abroad in case the labor union is banned in Poland. He is under surveillance of the secret police anxious to get their hands on the info. When the ship is in the middle of the Baltic sea martial law is declared and the ship is militarized. The captain announces he will turn and return the home port. Many anguished passengers put the life vests on and jump into the sea where they are picked up by two German ships. The teacher however decides to return to Poland and continue the struggle for freedom.
