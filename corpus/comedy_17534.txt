Yet another movie-turned-TV series that flopped was this comedy based on the 1987 Diane Keaton film of the same name. J.C. was the picture of Yuppiedom a stylish single Harvard-educated lawyer aggressively pushing her way up the executive ladder at a large corporation. Dates called her "The Tiger Lady". Then on her doorstep appeared baby Elizabeth left to her by a recently deceased English relative. J.C.'s high-powered career was thrown into turmoil. She tried hard to juggle the demands of instant motherhood and career but never could seem to decide which life she wanted. Seemingly oblivious to her plight were Mr.Curtis her demanding boss; secretary Charlotte; fellow lawyer Arlene; and officious young assistant Ken who was constantly angling for her job. Helga was the fearsome nanny who took care of Elizabeth while J.C. played office politics.
