The story of the Great Camps continues in the Saranac/St.Regis Lakes region of the Adirondacks. Here these woodland estates evolved in appearance and stature from 1897 to 1907 through the talents of architect William Coulter. On the shores of the Saranac Lakes he designed grand rustic lodges at camps Moss Ledge Eagle Island Prospect Point and at other distinguished camps. The wealthy considered an Adirondack camp fashionable. On Upper St. Regis Lake the richest woman in the world Marjorie Merriweather Post built her own Great Camp in the 1920's the lavish Topridge while at nearby White Pine Camp with its picturesque Japanese teahouse President Coolidge spent his summer fishing. A log villa set in the heart of the Adirondacks Santanoni possibly the grandest camp of its time tells a different story. Donated to New York State the camp deteriorated over many years but is now enjoying a renaissance with the help of state and local government and the preservation community. The public can now visit this special Great Camp whose owner might be considered nature itself.
