The gods have grown petty and paranoid and descend upon Earth to interfere in the lives of mortals and to spy on them- only to find that most people have forgotten them altogether. They like the mortals then become distracted and lose their sense of purpose - focusing instead on drug binges plastic grapes and face creams. Heavily improvised and shot in front of greenscreens the ensemble cast inhabit a totally artificial world which gives the film a surreal edge even when someone is simply waiting for a bus. An unusual low-budget experimental comedy destined to delight and offend.
