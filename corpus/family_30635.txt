Sixth-grade pupil Katka daydreams during a maths class about being Snow White and being freed by a prince who looks very much like Dzery from the eighth grade. Katka her girl friends Lenka and Martina and her fellow-pupils Franta Joska and freckled Vrabcák have spent five years going to the same little one-class school in their home mountain village of Pastvina. Their kind teacher Smetácek was very understanding about their games and fantasies but he didn't teach them much about arithmetic. They are now laughed at for their ignorance by the strict Bidlo their new teacher at the near-by little town. As he does every year Smetácek is preparing a theatre performance with the local children. Katka suggests the fairytale about Snow White.
