In New Year's Eve in the apartment of major Vlasov and his wife warrant officer Natalya Kiselyova the phone rings. It is the General who calls and congratulates Vlasov on perfect objectives on professional development and general military training of Vlasov's subordinates. The General confirms that the major regains his grade as lieutenant-colonel and orders to come to Moscow immediately as he needs him for a very important mission. Vlasov leaves his wife and daughter Masha nicknamed Mukha in Siberia and goes to Moscow. It turns out in localities near Moscow there is a communications battalion where only women serve and Vlasov is the only specialist who can manage "the weaker sex in uniform". He's the only one who can bring discipline in a female detachment. Vlasov has great good and bad experience in this area and tries to make personal approach to every woman in the battalion but the Marshall's granddaughter Zhenya Fyodorova and her true friends figure the new commander out very quickly and do everything to get rid off Vlasov. They even try as hard as they can to make him fall for Zhenya. Vlasov doesn't want to get Natalya upset and tries to keep back the details of his new service from his family. But Mukha misses her father a lot and flies to Moscow to visit Vlasov. Mukha quickly notices how popular her father is among women and being an ideal daughter brings her mother to Moscow under a very simple excuse - Mukha says that she got dangerously injured. The main characters become a part of a whirlwind of passion fake and true heartthrobs. Vlasov's marriage is within a hairbreadth of disaster but the General arrives and the battalion gets ready for the celebration of the Defender of the Fatherland Day as lovers solve their issues.
