A sorrowful night-in-the-life of a man in the modern urban jungle. A man in a dark suit and dark hat - who looks like an emaciated Fred Astaire - arrives home late at night and crawls into bed next to his sleeping wife. His sleep is restless and soon he has the night sweats. Then a dripping faucet barking dogs and his wife's snores make sleep impossible. He gets up; hallucinations start plus a real nightmare. When the alarm clock rings in the morning a different kind of nightmare begins.
