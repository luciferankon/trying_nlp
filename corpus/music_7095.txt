Billed as the "full-hour musical spectacular that won Nancy Sinatra the coveted Hollywood Star of Tomorrow award" this 1967 NBC-TV special sponsored by Royal Crown Cola is hosted by Nancy and features Dean Martin Sammy Davis Jr. Lee Hazlewood and Frank Sinatra (billed as 'A Very Close Relative'). Brother Frank Jr. makes a cameo appearance (and doesn't sing a note). Conspicuously absent from the program is Nancy's biggest hit: "These Boots Are Made For Walkin'".
