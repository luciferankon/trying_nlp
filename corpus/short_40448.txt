At the end of the Reagan years rocker and confrontational performance artist Lydia Lunch launches a broadside. From a formal podium she attacks the white male power structure of the US. Next she takes on her parents. Then the volume lowered and the background the streets of New York she lets us know what she thinks of life of herself and of us anyone who's watching or listening. Life is depression despair and death. She's the girl next door gone bad. And us? Compliant sheep. Lunch lays out a challenge.
