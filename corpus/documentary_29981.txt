In 1991 two cutting edge filmmakers: SCOTT SHAW and DONALD G. JACKSON created a new style of filmmaking. They titled it: ZEN FILMMAKING. In Zen Filmmaking no scripts are used. There are no rules and no definitions. The spontaneous creative energy of the filmmaker is the only defining factor. This allows for a spiritually pure source of immediate inspiration to be the only guide in the filmmaking process. On March 14 1992 upon the completion of the first two Zen Films: THE ROLLER BLADE SEVEN and RETURN OF THE ROLLER BLADE SEVEN the two filmmakers gave this impromptu interview on Hollywood Blvd. outside of their Hollywood California offices. This film documents this historic interview.
