A 14 year old girl is befriended by a couple of teenagers. They mislead her into believing she is going on vacation with them. They leave her at a ranch in the middle of New Mexico with a man who will sell her. Through various costumes and notes that she is given we see he is prepping her for the "special day" over the course of 5 days she collects evidence that she finds in this ranch that she will be "taken" by him in 5 days time. If she doesn't escape she will also be murdered. The only problem is she cannot escape due to the electrical collar around her neck which prevents her from leaving the property. One afternoon when the man leaves she decides its now or never and escapes via the lake where she crosses the electrical fence line which knocks her out. She wakes as she hears the truck arriving back. The man sees she is missing and so starts his hunt for her. It is only when he spots her on the top of the cliff that he attempts to reach her and slips falls and dies. She is now free to make her way back to civilization or is she.
