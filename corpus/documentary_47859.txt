A former TV director suffers from insomnia his conscience bothered by a program he made before. He filmed the present-day lives of university student activists from the 1980s who joined railway and factory workplaces only to be forced by his superiors at the TV network to broadcast a censored version. While facing his personal history and his own indebtedness toward those who threw themselves wholeheartedly into the labor movement he re-edits footage to show the activists' humanity and convictions. An act of penance by the student movement generation.
