George Gershwin miraculously melded classical music popular song jazz blues and spirituals in this quintessentially American masterpiece that tells the poignant story of a crippled beggar the headstrong woman he loves and the community that sustains them both. San Francisco Chronicle praised Francesca Zambello's production as a "powerful Porgy and Bess...persuasively led by conductor John DeMain and sung by a strong cast headed by Eric Owens and Laquita Mitchell in the title roles.... Owens brought vocal heft and dramatic sensitivity to the part of Porgy. Mitchell gave an evocative performance as Bess compounded of tempestuous need and penitence." "Dazzling and remarkable!" -San Jose Mercury News "Triumphant! A top-notch sold-out Porgy and Bess." -San Francisco Examiner
