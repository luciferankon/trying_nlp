Once upon a time (in 2010 - to be more exact) there was a naive young man called Zizou who came to a magic city (Tunis to be more precise) where on a popular souk and after some vexations he found both work and a couple of friends named Adel Hamma Sindicato Hadj Omar.... But life was not easy for all that as there were also villains (henchmen of power Islamic fundamentalists and other mafiosi - to be more explicit) who alternately lured him to their sides causing our gullible hero to endure blows slaps and humiliations galore. Of course there is no fairy tale without a pure selfless love and a pure selfless love did arise when Zizou working a roof caught sight of the most beautiful creature he had ever seen. Unfortunately Aicha the new princess of his heart was confined in a house against her will by a gang of dangerous mafiosi. With such an obstacle to overcome would the young man manage to save the belle end up marrying her and live happily after? All the more as at that point people took it into their heads to start a revolution against their tyrannical grand vizier (Ben Ali - to be correct) and he found himself caught in the middle...
