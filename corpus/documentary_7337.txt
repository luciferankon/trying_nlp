Nine-year-old No has lived with his big sister Metha all of his young life but now she is off to Japan for a whole year... It is going to be empty and quiet at home. However when Metha goes No can put his drum kit into her room and for the time being he is now no longer the annoying little brother. Yet it is going to be a difficult period because he misses her and perhaps he cannot fill the void that she has left in the house and in his heart.
