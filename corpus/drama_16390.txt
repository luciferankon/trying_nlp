Lust for Life is the extraordinary story of how David Bowie and Iggy Pop saved each other from madness addiction and almost inevitable rock star death. In 1976 at the height of the Cold War they rent a flat in West Berlin - and form an intense friendship built not only on a need to restart their flagging careers but also out of real deep affection. A friendship which left an indelible mark on music history and changed both men's lives.
