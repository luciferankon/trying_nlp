A war drama produced only 7 years after the end of World War I. Based on the play by Henry Wallace it chronicles two Englishmen Dick Chappell (George O'Brien) and Roddy Dunton (Walter McGrail) at the dawn of The Great War. Both men are in love with the same woman Violet Deering (Margaret Livingston). Chappell whose proposal has been accepted by Violet enlists for the war in Europe hoping to distinguish himself and make his fianc√© proud of him. After he leaves Violet suddenly finds herself drawn to Dunton instead who has also enlisted. She convinces him to let Chappell know that she has had a change of heart and that their engagement is off. However Dunton never confesses this and encourages his brazen and zealous friend to face the Germans in a fierce trench war battle in high spirits. Chappell is almost killed but able to survive though he is blinded during the attack. The guilt over what he has done ultimately has the remorseful Dunton commit suicide. Back home in London Dunton's sister Tessie (Madge Bellamy) nurses Chappell back to health. His sight eventually returns and he realizes Violet's schemes and drops her in favor of Tessie.
