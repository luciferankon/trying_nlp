One of the few shows which seems to capture animals in their natural habitat without fear of being hunted. In contrast to the norm this program highlights the interaction of humans animals and nature and the beauty of our often under appreciated wilderness. A pleasure to watch with the entire family. Truly enjoy the entertaining blend of characters sound and cinematography!
