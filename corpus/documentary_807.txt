Rendered Small is a short film that explores the over 1200 American folk art buildings on display in Steve Burke and Randy Campbell's private collection located in Hillsborough North Carolina. These diminutive churches movie theaters houses schools factories bowling alleys and more were made during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries out of materials ranging from meticulously detailed tin and wood to cigar and Velveeta boxes. The collectors have added on to their home multiple times in order to accommodate their continuously growing body of small structures. Over the course of the film the caretakers of this impressive assemblage discuss their fascination and share what it is like to live in their world as the viewer experiences the visual wonder of their collection.
