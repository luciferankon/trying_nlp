A group of children left their homes to follow Jacques de Cloyes (John Fordyce) in his pilgrim to Jerusalem. Jacques is saying that he had heard the Voice of God telling him to go to Jerusalem to find the grave of Jesus. While on their way there a monk (Lionel Stander) accompany them. Some of the children (girls and boys) makes a confession to the monk their unrequited love for Jacques their jealousies. Last one to confess was Jacques himself a boy so beautiful that girls and boys and even man fell in love with him. In the end is it really the Voice of God he heard?
