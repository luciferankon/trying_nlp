Émilie is a multi-platform romantic comedy. It is a fragmented story that unfolds across multiple media platforms. The basic idea is simple: to use a variety of broadcast and communication tools to tell a story and give the user a completely different experience. At the heart of the Émilie web series are the interactive videos in which characters call users on their cell phone and who can in turn receive text messages. There is a voicemail system that shares unreleased audio content and it is possible to see the story told over multiple screens with a laptop. Events print and web content will follow until the big event: the release of the film itself. The goal of this project was to breach the distance between the characters and the user/viewer so that they can immerse themselves more deeply into Émilie's world. Émilie is above all a strong narrative that has only been enhanced with technology. Underneath it all Émilie is the most beautiful tale that can be told: a love story.
