A young couple (Jake and Violet) travel to visit Aunt Rose in Arizona when they come across a religious cult frozen in time right out of 1890 who believe God has given them a Hyena (Razor) with a spiritual sense who can detect Sinners from God fearing good people. Only problem is Razor continuously turns on the alleged God-fearing folks in this absurdest dark comedy that points out the hypocrisy in all of us.
