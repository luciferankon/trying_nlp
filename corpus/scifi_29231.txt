Nobody will tell Lucy Project Phaeton's purpose -- she's an intern even if she's the only person keeping Greyhaven Industries' most dilapidated lab afloat. But when a visitor arrives with a death sentence for the experiment Lucy's frustrations collide with those of her unraveling boss in an ill-advised test run and . . . let's just say Project Phaeton really earns that ominous name. An unlikely team sets out to uncover just how far Greyhaven will go to get ahead -- and the only one who really knows the answer may be Janet the enigmatic receptionist. It's Lucy's chance to save the day but when it's time to choose how the line between hero and villain might prove thinner than she thought.
