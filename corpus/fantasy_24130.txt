Young Rand al'Thor grew up in a small peripheral town where the legendary city of Manatheran once stood. While the people of The Two Rivers are said to be descendants of legendary warriors Rand herds sheep. But from the mighty White Tower the exclusively women's center of frightful magic and inscrutible influence on their world one descends upon the town causing a stir; she takes Rand's betrothed away as a new apprentice. What she wants with Rand and his two best friends seems less certain especially when it appears Rand is not only a target of evil but he himself is tainted by The Dark One.
