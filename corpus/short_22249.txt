The film takes place over one day in Sweden. From dawn in VÃ¤stervik to sunset in Stockholm we meet a variety of characters going about their everyday lives. We see moments and fragments that reveal something about these people's existence. Moments which jointly form a whole a sense of Sweden in 2014. A film about loneliness and the desire for someone to see and understand us.
