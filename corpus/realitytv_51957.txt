Freakiest Festivals is a fun and irreverent special that showcases some of the more unique and unusual festivals around the country. Host Adam Gertler spends some "quality time" at such legendary festivals as the Beanfest & Great Championship Outhouse Race in Mountain View AK which starts with 2000 pounds of beans being cooked up and ends with the Parade of Outhouses; The Road Kill Festival in Marlinton WV where one man's roadkill is another man's meal; and The Emma Crawford Festival in Manitou Springs CO which features coffins racing down Main Street.
