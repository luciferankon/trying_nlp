Nuan Nuan a nine-year-old student is paralyzed and forced to drop out of school. No one in the village cared for her. Her parents are generally nice to her but often despise her because of her physical problem. To pass the time she studies and practices the art of paper cut at home. Slowly Nuan Nuan's name became familiar to everyone in the village for her craft. When a villager asked for her paper cuts she is treated like an average person. Nuan Nuan wanted everyone to treat her as a normal person so she practices paper cut with great effort. The director of the village was moved by Nuan Nuan's effort and said that her paper cuts would be sold to everyone in the village. She spent an entire night making paper cuts and asked her little brother to give them to every household in the village to thank them for their support. The school organized a peer support group to carry Nuan Nuan to school every day. The students said that the teacher praised Nuan Nuan's paper cuts as artwork and will win international awards. Whoever takes the best care of Nuan Nuan now gets to carry her to the international award ceremony.
