Seldom do a man's deeds loom so large that they dwarf the very mountains from where they emanate. One such person is Chandi Prasad Bhatt who has strong claims to being the first modern Indian environmentalist and arguably also its greatest. Bhatt was one of the pioneers of the Chipko movement not just a fight for protecting forests and environment but a struggle for protecting and renewing livelihoods. The Film seeks to decipher the life the motivation and work of a man who silently changed the paradigm of environment activism in India and has been described by Ramchandra Guha as one of the finest Indians alive today.
