Two mobs are dominating over the country the one led by the Limp and that of the Uncle. A shipment of costly 'red mercury' was lost on its way and it is only a small psychic Blagovest who is able to solve the problem. Though a gifted prophet he is a poor and naive man. Both the Limp and Uncle are after the psychic - the first is willing to recover his manhood and the second wants to locate the shipment. The Uncle kidnaps Blagovest and later the Limp lays his hand on him. Ultimately the psychic finds himself detained. Preoccupied with locating the shipment the mobs finish off each other. Blagovest's wife who in meanwhile left him for she was fed up with never-ending want of money returns to him aware what counts most of all is kindheartedness frankness and selflessness.
