At the opening of our film there exists two separate worlds in Battersea - the world of young professionals from middle class families and the world of graduates from working class families. Our drama consists in the collision of these two worlds that stand in direct opposition to each other. These two worlds are rarely brought into contact with each other except through the person of the Executive PA who weaves his way between these two worlds.
