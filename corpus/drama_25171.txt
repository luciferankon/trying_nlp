Young prisoner Jan nicknamed Roughboy ('Petr Cepek' (qv)) tries to commit suicide. He was imprisoned for a fight in which he injured a functionary of the National Committee and for stealing material but actually by the blame for this crime was pinned on him by the road-builders in whose group he worked. The prison doctor knows that Jan is an emotionally deprived person who never knew his parents and spent all his childhood - except one year with foster-parents - in orphanages homes for youth and reform schools. He arranges a five-day holiday for Jan who wants to find his mother's grave.
