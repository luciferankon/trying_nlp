POUNOPUNIK is a Bengali word. It means "recurrent". The Story of POUNOPUNIK is revolved around the struggle of a female sex worker to give her daughter the light of education. Being a member of the dark world of lust she fights hard to establish the identity of a mother over that of a sex worker. She is willing to fight all odds in order to fulfill her daughters dream to be educated. Our society is ruthless & inexcusable to those who try to lead a respectable life by erasing their dark past. In spite of that some people dream & fight. Maybe they will lose but they will surely leave behind inspiration for others to fight & win.
