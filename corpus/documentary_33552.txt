The word crisis would seem to characterize best the latest years of Mexican history. Economic crisis due to devaluations of the peso or the fall in world oil prices; crisis in the Mexican political system based on the state party; crisis in the ranks of the political class that just like in old times reverts to violence to settle its differences. It is true that these are years of crisis but also years of the emergence of a different Mexico.
