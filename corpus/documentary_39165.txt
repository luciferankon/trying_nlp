In autumn of 2013 the Ukrainian government suspended meetings regarding accession to the EU. This prompted a period of civil unrest culminating in the resignation of pro-Russian president Yanukovych and open conflict in the eastern part of the country. A group of filmmakers began recording these developments in their country from up close; their collective documentary presents a mosaic of suggestive images and personal stories organized into chapters according to theme and the filmmaker's approach. The "Rough Cut" in the film's title is not an indication of the incompleteness of the work but rather a metaphorical description of the situation in which the Ukrainian state currently exists.
