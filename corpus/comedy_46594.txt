Anybody who's ever had a dream knows that only one little thing stands between them and their idealistic vision: reality. Meet pragmatic and talented Kath Bailey and her artsy best friend Ariel Lovage the "Laverne & Shirley" of our times starry-eyed best friends whose dream is to create great theatre. Despite their full-time mind-numbingly insipid temp jobs their crazy trend-obsessed roommate and the dicey community theatre they've committed themselves to Kath and Ariel cling to the hope that someday they will create something beautiful. Bottom Little Theatre is a quick-paced mockumentary "Waiting for Guffman" styled web series that follows the earnest friends on their journey to realize their dreams with the hilarity sincerity and sometimes disillusionment that constitutes community theatre and its cast of eccentric characters. Clean and irreverent humor with lots of heart.
