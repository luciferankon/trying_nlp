With more than 27 years of service the space shuttle Discovery has clocked more time in space than any other shuttle. She has flown more than 148 million miles and has become one of the most storied spacecraft in American history. Join us as we celebrate her remarkable past and follow her final flight: to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. It's an emotionally charged mission full of logistical challenges. Discovery is a robust but very fragile aircraft and getting her to D.C. in one piece will require some innovative engineering.
