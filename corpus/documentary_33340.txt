Every year Double Fine Productions sets aside two weeks to work exclusively on developing prototypes for potential new titles. Traditionally studio founder Tim Schafer would collect idea submissions from all Double Fine employees and pick a handful to be prototyped. In 2012 however the selection process was made open to the public for the first time ever. Twenty three team members recorded pitch videos and posted them online to be voted on with the top five pitches being put into production. Progress was streamed online live everyday and collected in a daily video series. At the end of the two weeks the finished prototypes were distributed to the public voters.
