Edgar would rather spend his time locked away in his room trying to find a cure to death itself.

That attracts the attention of local gangster Mugsy who wants Edgar to use the miraculous serum to revive his murdered moll Hotlips. Things don't go to plan however and the reanimated Hotlips turns out to be an insufferable shrew with a nasty habit of decapitating the student body.
