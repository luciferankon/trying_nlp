MIND ZONE follows clinicians with an Army Combat Stress Control unit as they deploy to Afghanistan to carry out two missions: protecting soldiers from post-traumatic stress and keeping these same soldiers in the fight. With psychiatric casualties mounting the United States Army ups the deployment of mental health detachments to take care of battle-weary soldiers. The Combat Stress Control team is equipped with a wide arsenal of psychological techniques from mindfulness training resiliency conditioning to video therapy. But the challenges of managing the two missions confront sobering realities when boots hit the ground.
