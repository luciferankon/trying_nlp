The beauty of "Save Postage" lies in the dichotomy between the acts of seeing and watching listening and hearing reading and translating and thinking and feeling all at the same time. The strong forward motion of the film rivals life by the virtue that it keeps continuing whether you understand what is happening or are left totally confused.
