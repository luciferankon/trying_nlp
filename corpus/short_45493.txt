At a party in South London Benjy attempts to unleash the best party game ever. We join a bunch of party goers at the start of the game. Benjy has brought an exotic rum to the mix and acts as the puppet master as he unleashes his edgy take on truth or dare. The game starts to spiral spin after spin until Benjy finally looses control of his own creation.
