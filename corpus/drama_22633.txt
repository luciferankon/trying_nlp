Saints and Angels is a compelling fictional account of an Animal Liberation cell that has been organized for one evening in order to free animals from the daily tortures of experimentation and other forms of cruelty. Actual interviews and animal liberation footage make this a great introduction to the ALF and the entire movement in general.
