Up Late with Alec Baldwin is a late-night talk show that aired on MSNBC hosted by Alec Baldwin. The series lasted five episodes and aired Fridays at 10 p.m. from October 11 to November 8 2013 in a time-slot previously held by Lockup. Baldwin discussed current events and past experiences with various guests from news programs politics and the arts. The show used a multi-camera set-up. The set was fashioned after a New York City diner and Baldwin conversed with his guests over coffee while sitting in a corner booth. The show began its run while the host was in the midst of a two-year contract with MSNBC's production arm Universal Television. In an interview with The Daily Beast Baldwin stated "I'm going to do it for a year and then we'll see what happens."
