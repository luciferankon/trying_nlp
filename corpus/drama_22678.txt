Evtim Manasiev is an outstanding engineer. At the office he has made a name for himself as a "whole-hogger boss". At home his motto is: "Love me love my dog". His children rebel against his acting at variance with his own principles. Tired and exasperated Manasiev realizes that he has been wrong in some of his actions. On a holiday he runs into Mihaylova a subordinate of his whom he has recently fired undeservedly. The meeting urges him to reconsider and to review painfully all his previous life and principles.
