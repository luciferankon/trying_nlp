Make-up effects creators Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. - who go back with Fincher to his Alien3 days - as they chat about the fingers they created for Dwight Yoakam's character and the broken collarbone for Patrick Buchau's character. We also watch test footage and other basic material. It's a loose piece with some funny moments especially when Fincher sends Woodruff and Gillis back to the drawing board to make the fingers look less like "rubber Cheetos".
