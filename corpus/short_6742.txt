He interviews Tom's friends and family to find out. In doing so he finds that Tom is basically a good kid to who his car was everything. A few minor disappointments in his life were probably compensated for by the adoration he received from friends and and his younger brother for what they saw as his driving acumen most notably getting from point A to point B ahead of everyone else in one piece. Despite his father's want for Tom to obey all the traffic rules Tom was also modeling his father's own reckless driving behavior.
