After Elvis's less-than-triumphant stab at Hollywood he returned to his first love--music. The King Comes Back enables the viewer to be a fly on the wall as five of his confidantes recap Elvis's life in the late 1960s through the early 1970s in a lo-fi improvised living room setting. The stories run from the trivial (discussing Elvis's stress-related nosebleeds) to major (introducing Elvis--"the Happy Pappy"--to his daughter Lisa Marie) and take you from Hawaii to Memphis to Vegas. Just as in the other tapes in the six-tape set All the King's Men you are given a full view of his life for this time period only to look forward to the next chapter.
