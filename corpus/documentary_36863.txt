We follow eleven children from around the globe as they travel to the UK to form a football team that will play a match against one of the best junior clubs in the world. By observing them during their training sessions mentored by some of the best football players in the game we will see how the universal language of this sport can break down communication barriers and unite those who are seemingly so different. With their UK stay and training as a framework we throughout the film dive into their individual and unique stories at home. From the peacefully cosmopolitan streets of Copenhagen to the World Cup crazed favelas of Rio or the remote aboriginal community of Robinson River we will follow these children for one day observing how their environment and family structure have shaped their character. A classic nurture versus nature; if we all start out as blank canvases how deeply different can we be shaped in eleven years? And can these children overcome their differences and work together as a team when faced with the challenge of a nearly impossible match?
