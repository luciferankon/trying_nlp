Lincoln's family just moved in next door to Ronny's family and for the parents of the 2 boys to get along they take a vacation and leave the 2 boys at home so they can learn how to be best friends and get to know each other. Ronny doesn't like the fact that Lincoln has to spend his summer with him getting into crazy situations and going on adventures.
