Halsted is true story of the most important and innovative surgeon America ever produced. The successful daring and innovative William Halsted pioneered the use of local anesthesia but at a terrible price - in the process of revolutionizing surgery he became addicted to cocaine and was institutionalized. His friend and colleague William Welch gave Halsted a second chance at the newly established Johns Hopkins Hospital where Halsted went on to become the first chairman of surgery. This story follows a man who rose to prominence plummeted into addiction and then rose again like a phoenix to become one of the most influential physicians of the 20th century.
