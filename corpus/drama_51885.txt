Beautifully poetic social document charting Argentina's troubled history of social conflict and horrifically bloody dictatorships through the eyes of a general a transporter a dictator and revolutionaries all tormented by the memory of Eva Peron. The strangest thing about this story is that it's true. In 1952 Argentina's beloved First Lady Eva Perón died of cancer at the age of thirty-three. A renowned embalmer was commissioned by the grieving Juan Perón to preserve her body for display and Argentines flocked to be near "Evita." Three years later when his government was overthrown by a military coup Perón fled the country before he could make arrangements for the transportation of his wife's body. The military junta now in control kidnapped the corpse; so afraid were they of Eva's symbolic power that they even made it illegal to utter her name. Thus began the two-decade journey of Eva's body throughout Europe and eventually back to Argentina.
