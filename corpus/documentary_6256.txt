Episode 2 - "Reptiles and Relics" In this episode Andrew Wight and the Quest team entered the domain of the American Crocodile; growing up to 23 feet long it is a fearsome predator. Using the Quest's helicopter the team airlifted a boat to a remote lake in the Dominican Republic on the boarder with Haiti. Using their small vessel they helped capture tag and monitor several crocs. During a night-time capture Andrew Wight is bitten and the Quest's rubber boat is punctured by a croc - all in the adventurous pursuit of science. The Quest team also explored an underwater cave system in search of ancient Taino Indian artifacts. As they dived deeper into what was once a sacred cave they were rewarded with archaeological finds such as sacrificial bowls baskets and pottery all perfectly preserved underwater for perhaps the past 1000 years.
