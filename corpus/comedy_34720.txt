Monsieur Brucco is an Albanian working for 20 years in the same Swiss company. He has previously been told to have supposedly French roots so he is trying hard to be as French as in any way possible. One day he cuts his long finger and is certified permanently unfit for work by Doctor Schweizer who is the father of Anneli who has a secret crush on Brucco. As Brucco is reluctant to accept the life of an early-retiree he is contemplating a career change. So he finally becomes a door-to-door salesman for toys. After a mix-up he also becomes the target of the local mafia.
