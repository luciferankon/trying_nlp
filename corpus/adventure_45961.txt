Wood: A Family Affair is a documentary film about a family of three-generation loggers living in Little Mountain SC. Rain or shine Richard Kinard can be found selling firewood to local community members off of Highway 76 located in Little Mountain South Carolina. This has become a hobby for the 80 year old who has worked in the wood industry for over six decades. Continuing Richard's legacy is his son Danny who has also been working in the wood industry since the age of 16 when he began working for his grandfather at the family sawmill. While the Kinard's have made their fortune off of working in the wood industry will the next generation continue their work or will it end with Danny? The wood industry plays an important role in economic growth worldwide by providing lumber to build houses and daily essentials such as paper. It also involves heavy risk and is ranked as the No.1 most dangerous job.
