Ohad Naharin is Israel's "rock star" choreographer and artistic director of Batsheva Dance Company. He specializes in getting world-class dancers to move from their guts-not the mirror-by teaching them what he playfully calls "Gaga" his unique language of movement. In this dynamic close-up documentary veteran Israeli filmmaker Tomer Heymann renders a candid portrait of the movement and the man through an in-depth look at Naharin's rehearsal process with Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet of New York City. Heymann masterfully elicits a series of "Notes on Dance"from his subject climaxing in a denouement reminiscent of My Dinner with Andr√© in leotards and tights. See some of the world's greatest dancers let go of everything they know as they strive to fulfill Naharin's vision and their own deepest desires.
