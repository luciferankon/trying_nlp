Ashley and Steve rent a bed and breakfast where the owner does past life regressions. Ashley (the wife) goes under hypnosis and starts to become a possessed entity at night from what she thinks is her past life. Really the inn owner is conjuring her dead daughter through Ashley's body during the regressions. See what comes out of the regression. It'll make you think twice about being hypnotized.
