Over the past few years more than 200 people have disappeared from the vicinity of Lake Tanganyika. Their deaths were initially attributed to tribal warfare or a serial murderer but the killer is actually a giant predatory crocodile estimated to be 30 feet long and nearly a century old. A rescue mission aims to catch this giant predator and relocate him to safe waters-before he kills again.
