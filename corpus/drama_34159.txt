Ruka has yet to mature into a full-fledged vampire. His canines have yet to fully develop which means he still hasn't tasted human blood - or at least human blood that he's drawn himself. In order to get him prepared he is cast down into the world of humans where he boards with Jiro the owner of a Chinese restaurant and enrolls in high school. His homeroom teacher is a cheerful though meddlesome young woman who catches the fledgling bloodsucker off-guard. Is he actually falling in love with a mortal?
