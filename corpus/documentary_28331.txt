White supremacists determined to preserve the purity of the Slavic race are turning St Petersburg into the Neo Nazis capital of the world providing a clue for how a post-Perestroika Russia still searching for identity is falling under the sway of the ultra-right. It started out just like any other night for foreign students Michel and Samba. But as they left their university party someone was waiting for them. "I saw a man with a gun. We all started running then realized someone was missing" recalls Michel. "We looked back and saw a body lying flat. Samba". Samba's death was just the latest in a long series of attacks targeting foreigners in Russia. In one of the most notorious cases a nine year old Tajik girl was beaten to death by skinheads. Reluctant to acknowledge the scale of the problem police normally attribute racist murders to hooliganism. But in Samba's case that was impossible. The killers left behind a gun with a swastika and 'WP' the initials of 'White Power' carved on the handle. "The swastika on the gun means the people who killed him were members of the neo-Nazi organizations" explains Prof Dubrovsky. It's estimated there are around 15000 skinheads in St Petersburg. "Usually the groups are quite small" states Prof Dubrovsky. "Socially they are from low-middle class families and their parents have lost work and social status during the Perestroika". Encouraged by political parties like the DPNI which claim Slavic Russians "are on the verge of extinction" Neo-Nazi members believe they're fighting for the very survival of their race. The Dark Side of the White Nights reveals how a post-Perestroika Russia still searching for identity is falling under the sway of the ultra-right.
