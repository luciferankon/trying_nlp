When two best friends decide to go on a fishing trip they chance upon a headstone that is unmarked except for a PUMZACH inscription and a key located nearby. The two then set out on a venture to find out who is buried beneath the headstone. The trek takes them to a half Apache - half Irish medicine man a kleptomaniac waitress and an overweight man in search of rare buffalo nickels. Eventually they find a locksmith who leads them to an elderly woman whose only son has been missing for years. The film's name comes from the shaman's dog's name which has a problem with flatulence.
