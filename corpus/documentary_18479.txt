The Native American Warrior has been a focus of Native and Non-Native interest since the time of early petroglyphs. The perception of the Warrior has been communicated through books lore television and film as a stoic fighter and savage aggressor one who retaliated for lost lands and the constant enemy of the white rancher or soldier. Rarely has the the Warrior been seen outside the Indian world with the more accurate recognition of the reluctant fighter seeking to defend and protect a culture and lands against all odds. Complicated further is the attempt to understand the motives of a Native American military soldier fighting for America in world wars and conflict even when citizenship and voting rights have been denied. Impacted from the time of the Indian Scout and reinforced by cultural differences experiences Native and Non Native soldiers differ greatly. The answer to "Why Fight" requires a complex look at the truth through decades of stereotypes and misperceptions. Remarkably the answer has stayed the same whether during the 1500s Tiguex War the Indian Wars of the 1800s the World Wars modern Warfare or continued modern fights for sovereignty and environment. To Protect and defend - the cohesive thread that connects generations and tribes. This film allows the viewer to follow the journey of the Warrior as he (and she) continue conflict resolution in order to survive and secure resources and culture. The answers to Why Fight remain true through time; the need for Warriors continues. There will always be warriors. "What we do to the Earth we do to ourselves" and therefore there will always be warriors. (Chief Joseph)
