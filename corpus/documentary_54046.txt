MEAT is the modern story of the animals we eat as told by the people who never get to say their piece - from the solitary hunter who believes everyone needs to be educated about their food to an industrial pig farmer who argues that money isn't his primary driver. MEAT is a revealing and thought-provoking documentary that does not tell you what to think - but shines a new light on the people the land and everything that lies behind the supermarket shelves.
