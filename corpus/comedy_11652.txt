From the co-founder of Slamdance comes the story of a young man who returns home from a trip abroad to confront not just his peculiar family and friends but also a pair of Colombian jewel thieves and a roving gang of Iowa kickboxers culminating in a showdown at Carhenge. A seminal movie in the history of independent film "Omaha: The Movie" was the film that spearheaded the birth of the Slamdance Film Festival.
