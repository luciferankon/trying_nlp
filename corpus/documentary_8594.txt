Alaska is a land of extremes - the biggest coldest windiest wildest. Its climate and land forms are shaped by two oceans the moving earth and frozen polar air. Through it flows the Yukon River perhaps the last untamed river on North America. In this film Alaska's story is told as never before. Beautiful photography of stunning landscapes are modified with computer images to show how populations and natural forces have changed the land. Intimate portraits show the spirit of the people both native to Alaska and those who came to change the land were dominated by it.
