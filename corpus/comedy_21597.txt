A laboratory accident gives rise to a unique kind of zombies that invade and terrorize a community. A group of people having their family reunion nearby become the first victims and also unwittingly lead a resistance against the zombie insurgence. Self-described as "Blazing Saddles" meets "Dawn of the Dead."
