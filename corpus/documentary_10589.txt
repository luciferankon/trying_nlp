February '99. Klaus Maria Brandauer arrives in London for his English-speaking stage debut in Esther Vilar's Speer. Directing and playing the title role he and his co-star Sven Eric Bechtolf have 12 days to prepare for their challenge. Film-maker Martin Wagner who also translated the play had unprecedented access to the rehearsals. His film captures the underlying tension as the opening night approaches and provides a unique and unpretentious insight into one of the finest actors of his generation.
