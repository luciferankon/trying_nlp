Syndicated show produced between 1987 and 1989; debuted in the USA in September 1987. Two teams of three men and three women competed; one person from a team was given the name of a famous person and had to communicate the name to the rest of the team by drawing pictures. One of the few successful new game shows of the 1980s two three-member teams--each composed of two celebrities and one contestant--competed in this game of pictorial charades. One member of the team is shown a phrase (or perhaps the name of a person place thing etc.) and is given 60 seconds to convey the solution by drawing pictures of the phrase's key words; at the 30-second mark the team member could ask a fellow teammate to continue drawing the solution. If the contestant (or one of his celebrity teammates) could guess the solution the player won $200 (or $100 if a hand-off was taken) otherwise the opposing team has a chance to guess for $100. Three rounds were played followed by a bonus round in which both contestants competed. Each contestant was given 90 seconds to guess (or try to convey) as many one-word answers as they could at $100 apiece; the trailing contestant after three rounds went first followed by the third-round leader. The winner after three rounds won $1000 and returned to compete on the next show.
