An independent documentary showing different faces of the relation between humans and other species. Who are the animals and what place do they occupy in modern society? Why are they killed in uncounted amounts? Why are they imprisoned and sentenced to unnecessary pain although they want to live they want to be free and they want to avoid suffering as much as we do? How does the objectification of animals reflect on inter-human relations? If the answer is THEY'RE ONLY ANIMALS then what does it mean to be human?
