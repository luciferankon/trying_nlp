Tension is high on the first joint operation of the new Nordic Intelligence Community Enterprise. Live footage in the Scandinavian capitals shows Fred as first man into the Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula hide out in Damascus. Their leader has flown but findings substantiate the rumor of an upcoming terrorist attack on multiple European cities. Freelance reporter Emma travels to Syria for an embedded PR exercise with the Nordic forces. She still has a subtle limb from when she five years ago nearly became the first woman accepted at the Norwegian Special Forces Academy. The PR convoy is attacked by AQAP insurgents led by the infamous Pakistani Norwegian thug-turned-Islamist Masood. Emma and the captured journalists are displayed online to an enormous media uproar. When all military and political efforts to find the hostages fail as the clock ticks down to the anticipated terrorist attack on Europe Fred is given permission to "detach" and lead his NICE crew into any battle necessary to succeed.
