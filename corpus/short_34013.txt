A guy tells a shaggy-dog story to a restaurant crew on a ten-minute break. He takes us back to 1992: he's walking down a New York City street with two women when a Black couple asks for directions. This event leads a lecture from the two women a memory from his Bar Mitzvah a moral dilemma a mugging the loss of two pairs of glasses an upbraiding from an optician a basketball game and running commentary from his co-workers in front of the restaurant as he tells the story. It and the break come to an end: has he made friends advanced race relations entertained?
