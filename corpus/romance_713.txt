Her father Alexander is scheduled to go to the isolated Crompton mansion in New Hampshire to paint a family portrait of the mysterious reclusive author Lee Crompton but he falls ill and cannot. Alix decides to take his place. Much to her shock Lee is horribly disfigured from a disease called acromegaly. Still she has an obligation and so goes on with the painting.
