Six players compete as a team to win up to $1 million by answering logic/riddle-type questions. The players have 60 seconds to discuss each question after which the team captain has to respond. Three forms of help are available each of which can be used once: an extra 30 seconds of discussion time switching the question out for a replacement or rejecting the captain's answer and changing it. Cash awards range from $6000 for the first question up to $1 million for the tenth. If the team misses a total of four questions the game ends and they leave with nothing. After any correct answer the team can vote to end the game but a unanimous vote is required in order to stop.
