Funhaus is a YouTube gaming channel working under the company Rooster Teeth. Their content consists of gameplays Q&A's comment reviews and a weekly podcast cleverly named Dude Soup. They will also do collaborations with anyone willing to forget their morals for a little while. Funhaus started in 2013 as the YouTube channel "Inside Gaming" working with the company Machinima. It was originally started as a news channel featuring Adam Kovic and Bruce Greene. Game plays were soon introduced and quickly became their dominant form of content. Over time new members were introduced most already working behind the scenes. James Willems was the first to be featured in a video. The group continued to grow over time adding Lawrence Sonntag Matt Peake Joel Rubin and Sean Poole while at Machinima. Since beginning work with the company Rooster Teeth in 2015 under the new channel name "Funhaus" they have added Elyse Willems to the main roster. However they have lost Joel Rubin and Sean Poole due to the pursuit of new interests.
