Ground Effect is a surface investigation of a series of loci along the constantly shifting 80 km long line in Israel/Palestine under which rainfall amounts to less than 200mm a year on average. This line which aligns with the global desert belt cuts from the east near the West Bank to the west near the Gaza strip. It is where I grew up an area divided between industrial scale agriculture nature preserves ancient and recent ruins Bedouin towns encampments and olive groves artificial pine forests planted on contested lands and demolished villages rural Jewish communities and military practice zones. This area has been fittingly called "The Conflict Shoreline" by architect and theorist Eyal Weizman in his recent book of the same name. The process used to create the work involves scanning and compressing the ground surface (from wild and cultured plants to dust to Jewish and Bedouin graves to walled-off water reservoirs military monuments and border fences) via waist-high aerial video while being surveilled in turn by an unmanned drone running algorithms similar to what a military drone would use to isolate motion from a noisy background. At key moments in the piece geological core-sample-like images appear layered and in motion - these build on a process for time-delayed panoramic video 'strips' I've developed for a series of body-driven 'city scans' I've made in the past few years around the world.
