Stanley Siegel is a retired broadcaster-known to millions for his groundbreaking and often controversial interviews on WABC-and with Stanley On The Go he single-handedly redefines the travel show. Indeed he redefines the notion of adventure: you don't have to be a young Olympian to have a zest for life. Experience shouldn't-and doesn't-end at 60. Stanley shows that there's more to retirement than bingo and shuffleboard on the Lido deck. He's an inspiration. Stanley takes us headlong around the globe: whether he's on a camel in Giza the deck of a Navy aircraft carrier off San Diego straddling a speeding motorbike through the streets of Moscow or balancing on top of the Sydney Harbor Bridge each episode is a tour de force with a force of nature. Stanley is irrepressible-his commentary is not only informative and enlightening but is also often surprising and frequently irreverent. He shows us the iconic sights-the Grand Tour-but also uncovers the unexpected.
