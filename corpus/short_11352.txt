Missing Person is the story of an estrangement-- told through the unreliable recollections of the abandoned man Eddie. His wife Maria is missing. The key mystery is the capacity in which she may or may not be gone. Eddie is figuratively speaking as lost as his wife it seems and our two investigating detectives Schmidt and Milton are left like the audience to put together the pieces of his patchwork narrative. Things unravel like a poorly told lie until the story like Eddie himself no longer holds together.
