John Sinclair first emerged out of his small-town Michigan background to forge a legendary course through the 1960s as a cultural activist manager of the MC5 and Chairman of the White Panther Party. An early victim of the War on Drugs who faced 20 years to life in prison for giving two joints to an undercover policewoman Sinclair served 29 months of a 9-1/2-to-10-year sentence before his legal victory on appeal changed the law for good. The long campaign waged by Sinclair culminated in a massive John Sinclair Freedom Rally headlined by John Lennon & Yoko Ono Stevie Wonder Bob Seger Phil Ochs Allen Ginsberg and Bobby Seale that resulted in Sinclair's release from prison on December 13 1971-just three days after the event.
