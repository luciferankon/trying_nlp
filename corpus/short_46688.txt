Sekundenfalle can with simplification be reduced to a film on the theme inside/outside. The treatment is located especially on the cuts such as the window in the wall the TV as a window into an imaginary room the surface of the skin with a wound as an entry point as well as the "actor" who represents a thermal frontier. Even so the images in Sekundenfalle do not serve to illustrate a theme. Much more important is that Brehm shows what he shows. (Peter Tscherkassky)
