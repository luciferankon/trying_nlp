The short documentary ALISON MATHEWS ART MATTERS explores the aesthetic preoccupations and methodologies of artist Alison Mathews. The film traces Mathews' development as a creative person and examines the artist's process behind the construction of her inventive pop culture-influenced imagery. Mathews' affinity for expressive line work patterning repetition and color is revealed both in an introspective interview with the artist and captured in her painting studio at the very moment of creation.
