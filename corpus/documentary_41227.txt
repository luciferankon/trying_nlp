And that could mean constructing the planet's tallest tower - at one mile high it would be the world's first moving breathing building. But to build it engineers will have to overcome incredible obstacles and revolutionize the way we construct skyscrapers...Cable-less elevators would have to be invented farms that grow inside buildings would be engineered and windows that breathe and think for themselves could be created.
