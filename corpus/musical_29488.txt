Rufus Wainwright staged a special performance of his traveling contemporary opera Prima Donna at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus Athens on September 15 2015. The opera featured a new film accompaniment directed by Francesco Vezzoli and starring Cindy Sherman as an aging soprano who hopes to pull off a comeback performance in Paris on Bastille Day. In the film Sherman performs against the backdrop of the Théâtre des Variétés Paris in costumes originally worn by legendary soprano Maria Callas.
