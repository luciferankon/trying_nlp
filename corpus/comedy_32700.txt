Ompong (Dolphy) who is really born and famous for his extraordinary laziness and not-always-funny stupidity was put into a hard challenge when he promised to his mother that he will not stop until he finds a job that would change his life. His whole life turns anew when he was luckily hired as one of the fireman in their town. His innate attitudes were still present and even blamed as ingredients to a lot of trouble. His only consolation though considered a grand prize is winning the heart of Margarita (Rosemarie Gil) which even inspired him to do exemplary things even putting his job being a fireman to a noticeable pedestal.
