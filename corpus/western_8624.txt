A remake of 1930's "Phantom of the Desert" in which a crooked foreman and the ranch hands are rustling horses and laying the blame on a wild stallion that roams the surrounding hills.In this one the principals are Jim/Cheyenne(Rex Lease) as the cowhand that comes along and clears the horseStarlight;the crooked foreman is Clyde Winslow(Harry Woods) while Helen Sutter(Dorothy Gulliver) is the daughter of ranch owner Frank Sutter(Jay Hunt.) This one was remade at least four more times by 1940. A rancher is having his horses rustled but no one has seen the rustlers. He sends for Cheyenne who is quickly fired when he is drugged and made to look drunk. But Cheyenne returns to the masquerade party and learns the foreman is behind the rustling and then sees the real rustler is a white horse. When no one believes him he sets out to find the horse.
