so the plot is very simple you have this really cool down to earth dude you know a man's man going around looking at everybody's neat stuff everything from collections of video games movies really cool toys old bicycles all kinds of crazy stuff this was a very fun show. Quite a shame that its not on the air anymore. Ahead of its time.
