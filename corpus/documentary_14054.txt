During the time of the Cold War the border between Western countries and Eastern bloc meant the end of the world. The autumn 20 years later shows a new picture: Fertile landscapes exotic animals and energetic farmers trying to heal the wounds of the past. This still makes the regions special and unique. The former no-go areas where life and economy had their own rules are now re-discovered as remarkable nature and cultural landscapes when the Iron Curtain finally opened. The documentary by Matthias Hoferichter goes on an autumn journey along this now green belt from south to north. Here with hard work and new ideas farmers are trying to utilize the forbidden areas of the past. While herb farmers in Bulgaria dry and proceed the harvest of the warm summer the grape gathering is about to start in Hungary. In Germany farmers from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania breed endangered farm animals and successfully built a new business with the sale of goat cheese. Autumn slowly becomes winter and while the Estonian cattle on the island Hiiumaa can still enjoy the last green blades of grass in the sun the reindeer in the far north of Finland already walk through snow. Right next to the Russian border the reindeer herders of the indigenious Sami still practise the reindeer breeding just like their ancestors did it centuries ago. But even for them it becomes more and more difficult to live in a traditional way only. The journey along the former border discovers landscapes and people which have experienced a unique history in the shadow of the Iron Curtain and offer the visitor a fascinating view of life before and after the opening of the border.
