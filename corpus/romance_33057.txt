In the late 1960's most people thought heart transplantation was not a possibility now it's a reality. Today medical scientists believe the human lifespan can be extended to one thousand years. CHARLES and MARIE DUBOIS living on a Perique tobacco farm near Paulina Louisiana already may hold the key to extended longevity. On a summer afternoon in June a sailplane lands in the middle of the Dubois tobacco field to avoid a thunderstorm. The valuable tobacco crop is destroyed during the landing. The pilot JIM BROOKS while seeking aid at the Dubois farmhouse is faced with making some unusual bargains not only for the return of his sailplane but for his life.
