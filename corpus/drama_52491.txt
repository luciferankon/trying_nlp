The adventures on the journey including the pit-stop at Granny's house where Granny comforts Clare and treats the men as heroes all contribute to her increasing recovery and the precious bond with her baby Becky is formed. But when the journey is almost over a chance meeting with her scheming husband and his lover who steal the baby away means Clare has to look to her own resources to rescue Becky and escape Sebastian forever.
