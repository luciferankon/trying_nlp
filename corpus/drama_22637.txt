It's hard to fit in. Especially for Johan. There is something wrong about him. He talks to himself and someone called Linnéa. Johan will do anything to make Linnéa a reality. He summon Satan to try sell his soul for his dream girl but his wish has bad consequences. Satan takes over Johans body and tries to take over the world. Watch Linnéa try to take back that nice boy Johan once was.
