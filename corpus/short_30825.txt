'Extraction: The Plundering of the Amarakaeri Reserve' provides first hand accounts from the indigenous Harakmbut tribe living in the shadow of seismic oil exploration on their land deep in the heart of the Peruvian rain forest. With their livelihoods and very existence in jeopardy the Harakmbut are fighting back against their own Government and Texas based Hunt Oil to put an end to what they see as the decimation to the natural habitat they've hunted and fished upon for thousands of years. Extraction documents the sobering fact that U.S. companies are still in the business of pursuing the most vulnerable people and eco-bio diverse regions on our planet all in the name of monetary profit.
