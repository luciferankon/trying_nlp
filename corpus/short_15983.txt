On a seemingly safe and dusty rural road frequented by horses and their carriages a two-seated automobile is moving erratically. And then unexpectedly in one glorious point-of-view shot the vehicle dashes full-speed into an ill-starred passer-by as the film ends with a rather enigmatic punchline: "Oh mother will be pleased." Without a doubt the man saw stars. As the camera looks down an open road a horse and carriage approaches and passes by to one side of the field of view. Soon afterwards an automobile comes up the road straight towards the camera. As it gets nearer the occupants start to wave frantically but can a collision be avoided?
