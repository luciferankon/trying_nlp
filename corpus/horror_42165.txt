Artie's back! He's a janitor in a psychiatric clinic whose patients are wealthy socialites. Tina Krause and Deana play the rich and snotty socialites whose paths cross with Artie's. Debbie D and Dawn Murphy play the nurse and doctor respectively. Dr. Sorens thinks she can "help" Artie. But she doesn't know how wrong she is!
