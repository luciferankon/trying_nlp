Renzo Gracie is the third generation of Jiu Jitsu fighters from the famous Brazilian Gracie family tracing their art back to the last great samurai school in Japan. Renzo and the Gracie name are linked to the global phenomenon of mixed martial art fighting one of the fastest growing sports in the world. The film follows him over a 10 year period from the days when Renzo fought bare knuckle in a cage with little or no rules. After the fights are banned from US television he follows the fight scene to Japan where his skill honour and refusal to give up make him a huge star. While others fight for fame and glory Renzo is driven by a will to honour the family legacy. Although he continues to test himself in competition against the best on the planet his passion for his art is equalled by a need to pass on his skills and experience. As another generation rise under his tuition Renzo fights on into his late 30s when injuries and a downturn in his fight record signal an end to his career. He returns to his roots and mentor in Brazil to consider his future and reaches the only decision he can live with. Returning to the US his comeback catches a new wave of national interest.
