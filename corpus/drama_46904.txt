A prostitute from the Northeast desperate and unable to make ends meet abandons her baby. An unemployed factory worker decides to take the child for the 200 yuan (about $37 Canadian) a month in child support promised by its mother. His early attempts at child-rearing are somewhat painful to watch but also charming and amusing. Eventually he and the mother become friendly and it seems that the child will be raised in a sweetly unorthodox family. However when the woman's pimp a local gangster not only finds out that he may have fathered the child but also that he is dying of cancer he decides that he must adopt the baby - and is willing to resort to violence if necessary.
