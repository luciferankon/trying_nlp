Pat is burning. He is burning from the electromagnetic waves which swirl thick through the air daily monthly yearly. In effect he is like a walking aerial. He is sick and doesn't know why. He is sick and no one knows why. Pat had a job once - a good one but now he won't leave the house except in the dead of night when sleeping has become as impossible as going down to the shops for milk or a paper... The more he is sickened the more he loves and needs his children but the more he tries to show his love the more the enigma denies it. He feels alone. He feels he should be alone.
