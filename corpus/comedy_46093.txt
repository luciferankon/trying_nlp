Sean a young man in college comes home for summer--the first time in three years. Aimless and having fallen on difficult times he hopes that being home will be a much needed retreat. While home Sean reunites with his childhood friend Dylan; a frenetic but charming pizza parlor savant who never left town. Dylan lives with their former teacher Big J who since was fired and divorced after being caught smoking pot. Together the two of them go on a series of misadventures fueled by alcohol and a corncob pipe. Sean also rekindles a relationship with Marlene a girl he pined after in high school. Driven to succeed and never come back Marlene bears a deep secret and an equal resentment for their town but slowly opens herself up to Sean as the summer progresses. When Sean learns Big J's dog is missing he dedicates all his time searching for it. Unfortunately after a deal for some pot gone wrong someone is searching for him too.
