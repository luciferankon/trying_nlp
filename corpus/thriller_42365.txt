A guy on a mountain bike stalks five students murders them and eats their brains. They say its safe healthy and fun to hill walk in Scotland but they don't tell you when there is a cannibal on the loose. Fiction? Is it? Not so for Isla Peterson and Pearl Johnson two final year students when they meet Brendan the campus cannibal. Shot in the rugged mountain pass of Glencoe in the heart of the Scottish Highlands the serenity and beauty of the wild open landscape is a hunting ground and an easy killing field for the twisted Brendan who only has one thing on his mind - eating the girls' brains.
