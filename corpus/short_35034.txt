This film is a recording of an experiment. A from-screen recording of a computer animation an instance of a so called "Game of Life" -- a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. A zero player game. In this film the "game" was programmed and set up by experimental physician Alex Szalay. The film demonstrates that stories don't really need to be "written" (from the beginning to the end) it is enough to compose the outset the initial setup a combination of characters and the rest will come as due consequences. In this Game of Life instance there were three types of characters: offensive defensive and neutral. And - as the onscreen happening demonstrated - according to what the majority of the characters were like (offensive defensive or neutral) 3 different end-constellations would occur which director G치bor B칩dy named as: The Dog's Night Song The Garden of Flight High Noon - respectively. It is also worth noting that director G치bor B칩dy later in 1983 made a feature film under the title "Dog's Night Song".
