In 1964 in rural southwest Mississippi a young black college student Charles Moore and his friend Henry Dee were kidnapped by the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan taken into a nearby forest beaten tortured and then taken to the Mississippi River's backwaters where they were thrown in still alive. For 40 years nobody seemed to care except Charles' older brother military non-comm Thomas Moore. Until that is national news organizations began to investigate this "cold case" Civil Rights murder in the late 1990s. David Ridgen documentary filmmaker for Canadian Broadcasting took up this cause along with Thomas Moore. This film is the record of their investigation and their journey back to the sites of the murders. A journey into a true heart of darkness this one in the United States. One surviving accused killer James Ford Seale was convicted belatedly in 2007 and went to prison.
