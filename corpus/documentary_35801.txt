An estimated 12 million people live in refugee camps worldwide and only 0.1% are resettled repatriated or integrated into normal society each year. The feature-length documentary "Warehoused" explores the plight of long-term refugees through a glimpse into the lives of those living in Dadaab Kenya one of the world's largest refugee camps. We see the camp's inner workings through one man's journey to do everything in his power to provide for his family. This man's story is not unique however; it accentuates the much larger problems that long-term refugees have faced for centuries. Organizations like the UNHCR work to provide assistance to refugees but these are only temporary fixes to often protracted refugee crises. "Warehoused" tells the story of these courageous men and women and how they struggle through hostile circumstances to find a place they can call home.
