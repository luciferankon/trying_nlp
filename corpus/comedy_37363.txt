Dr Xand van Tulleken takes a satirical look back on the last year in health news. With a round-up of the some of the most baffling medical headlines of 2016 he investigates whether rollercoasters really do cure kidney stones whether paracetamol is turning us into a nation of psychopaths and whether we need to rethink how we use the loo. Drawing on his medical expertise and personal experience as a doctor Xand picks apart the facts behind the tabloid hype - including his take on the real reasons behind last year's junior doctors' strike. With stunts sketches experiments and expert interviews Second Opinion is the show that's knowledgeable to pull the nonsense out of the headlines but professional enough not to ask how it got in there.
