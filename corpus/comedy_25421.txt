The Locals is a comedic love story set in the Bronx about two three generational families; one Jewish one Italian. Ironically these families as most Jews and Italians have so much in common; love of the gab love of food they talk with their hands they feed you with guilt and fill your hearts with cultural humor that somehow bridges the divide between all cultures and all generations. A New York based Romeo and Juliet with modern a twist that harks to the hilarity of Moonstruck and the lovable absurdity of familial dysfunction in Little Miss Sunshine.
