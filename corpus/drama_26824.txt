Docudrama about Jan Karski (1914-2000) a WWII Polish resistance fighter and a heroic courier for the Polish Underground who in 1942-43 informed the Polish Government in Exile in London and the western Allied governments about the extermination of Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto and in the Nazi extermination camps situated on a territory of Poland. It's an assemblage of contemporary narration with scenes from Karski's life and actions including archival footage. The modern part involves two filmmakers who under pressure of time work on a docudrama about Karski. The historical part consists of the scenes staged by actors who recreate episodes from the life of Karski for a need of the film: interrogation in Nowy Sacz visit to the Warsaw Ghetto meeting with Szmul Zygielbojm in London. Making of the film enables a discourse about the protagonist's dilemmas and moral choices and their significance to young generation in forming its attitude toward the modern world.
