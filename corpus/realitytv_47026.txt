In this one-hour special we'll profile families who've dedicated themselves full-time to raising "monkids" or primates that are treated as family members. Our monkey parents will share with us the unique reasons why they own primates from wanting a 'forever baby' to coping with empty nest syndrome. We'll join our families as they try to overcome the challenges of parenting a monkey. We'll also get inside our character's heads by visiting top experts to find out the psychological impulses that may drive monkey parents to love an animal most say should be behind zoo bars or out in the wild. This is a co-production with Zig Zag Productions Ltd. (UK).
