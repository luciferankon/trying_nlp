A week before their wedding Halle and Todd are given an ancient gift from an elderly couple....the ability to 'see the world through each other's eyes'. But when they wake in each others bodies they are more cursed than blessed for they have to endure a week of living as the other...going to bachelor parties and dealing with the wedding planner. But most sobering of all is the fact that they may not be 'as right' for each other as they believed.
