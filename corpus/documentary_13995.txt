All Things Bakelite a film by John Maher is a virtual periodic table of elements that combine to create a joyous and provocative story about the "father of modern plastics". In 1907 Leo Hendrik Baekeland a Belgian-born American chemist made one of the most transformative discoveries of the 20th century: Bakelite. It was the first wholly synthetic plastic and it ushered in an explosion of new man-made materials that marked the beginnings of our modern industrial age.
