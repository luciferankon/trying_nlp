A seedy ostensible poet Spooner visits the home of his wealthy and successful counterpart Hirst. Their conversation suggests that they have come there after meeting in a pub. Further conversation suggests that they knew each other at university and share acquaintances and perhaps even lovers. Hirst's associates/assistants Foster and Briggs do their best to intimidate Spooner.
