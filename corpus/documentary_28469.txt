Jack J. Blanco author of the Bible paraphrase The Clear Word was born to a German immigrant in Chicago. Jack's father abandoned his mother during her pregnancy with Jack. Left to raise Jack on her own his mother worked multiple jobs. Over the years she had saved enough to visit family in Germany. After a few weeks she had to return to the US to work her father suggested she leave Jack nearly 10 on the family farm for the summer to work and grow stronger. In 1939 World War II began and Jack was unable to go home as planned. America declared war on Germany in 1941 and Jack was placed in a labor camp. He miraculously escaped only to be turned away by his grandfather and forced back to the camp. After his second escape he eventually returned to the United States with hundreds of post-war immigrants. He reunited with his mom working in his stepfather's caf√©. Jack went back to school and discovered a lifelong love for education. Having turned his back on religion Jack became a skeptic of anything spiritual. Upon learning that he was to be drafted he joined the Air Force and was stationed on Guam. While his friends partied he began reading everything available. At the prompting of a friend he read the Bible and discovered a Father who cared about him. Jack gave his life to God and through a series of miracles became a professor missionary and theologian. "I never grew up with a father" Blanco says. "My hope is that this film will tell the story of how my Heavenly Father found me. Sometimes when I pray I call Him 'Dad.' He's my Dad!"
