The only thing more agonizing than considering what other people think about you is to dwell on your own judgments and self-loathing. Cake is a modern fable of our inner demons. Jason takes us through a journey of self control as he attempts to regulate his desire. As he withholds from his gluttonous ways the pain drives his impulses to alter what is sufficient and tolerable. The loneliness and despair is at times both painful and comical. Jason is no more a demagogue as he is a brute. One must accept that self-control is mundane but being unhinged is remorseful.
