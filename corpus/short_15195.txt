This experimental narrative braids three streams of consciousness as it explores the ways in which strangers draw conclusions about each other based solely on appearance. As three individuals from different races and generations sit at a park bench we are presented with various fantasies that are linked to the private perspective of each character. The film exposes the ways in which we make quick judgments about people without really knowing who they are or where they come from.
