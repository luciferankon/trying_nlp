An elementary-school class is having a "toy fair" today where every student brings in a favorite toy for show-and-tell. The teacher tells the story of a toy telephone-repair truck to explain where toys come from. We see how the toy trucks are assembled and tested in a factory workshop. One toy truck has a drop of yellow paint on its hood a defect that is missed when it and the other trucks are boxed for shipping. We see the toy trucks loaded into a real truck and taken to a railroad station. From there trains carry the toys to stores across the country. The students are asked to think about how far the toys have traveled and how many people have worked to make and bring all the other toys to the toy stores. All sorts of people come to the store to buy the toys. Some children are too young to play with the toy truck and some are too old. All the toy trucks are sold except for the one with the spot of paint. Curtis David Wilson III (his friends call him "Skipper") is just the right age and his mother buys the truck for him as a surprise birthday gift. The class is asked to consider all of the people who helped Skipper get his toy telephone-repair truck from the women who made it in the factory to the men who transported it to the train station and to the store and to the clerks in the toy store. Because of the efforts of all these people children are encouraged to appreciate their toys and to take good care of them so they will last a long time.
