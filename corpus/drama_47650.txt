Rhandah who is to succeed his father the Maharajah of Dharpuli is sent to Oxford to be educated. The Princess Nada to whom he is engaged fearful of the outcome of his journey gives him an amulet to bring him back to her in safety. At the college he soon becomes accustomed to English customs but refuses all invitations into society. He meets Amy daughter of Colonel Dawe and they become interested in each other. Amy wagers that she can persuade the Prince to give her the amulet and succeeds in having him accept her invitation to a party; she manages to see Rhandah alone and secures the amulet. Dick Larimer to whom Amy is engaged denounces Amy for doing such a thing. Asa Judd tutor to the Maharajah's son has taken a snap shot of Amy and Rhandah and sent it to Colonel Marcy the Resident British Councilor. Mulai Singh an aspirant to the throne obtains possession of the photograph. Rhandah embittered returns home just as the Maharajah dies. By his bedside he swears eternal vengeance on all the English and is overheard by Nada. He seeks out Mulai Singh and obtains the picture declaring his intention of leading his people against the English issuing a command that all captured English be brought before him. Dick is taken and Rhandah orders him to the dungeon. Amy has come to India with her father and is also taken by the outlaws but when they see the amulet they release her. Nada recognizes her from the picture and comes upon Rhandah and Amy as he is contemplating what he shall do with Dick. Rhandah makes advances to Amy which she dares not resent and tells him she will do anything to save Dick but he replies there is nothing that will save her sweetheart. Nada listening ready to kill Amy with a dagger overhears and rushes into Rhandah's arms vowing her belief in him. At Amy's solicitation Nada intercedes and Dick is set free. All the trouble and turmoil is at last ended and both couples are happy.
