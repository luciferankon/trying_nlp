A film about another American fad of the 30s. Small-town bumpkin Winfred Simpson is annoyed by the attention paid to his girl Phyllis Jenkins by a hotshot trick cyclist Harry St. Clair breezing through and impressing the locals on a personal appearance tour at the town theatre. When Phyliss turns Winfred down he hits the road to become a success at the big 6-Day bike race. He meets Clinton Hemmings and they become partners as it is a two-man event and get practice time for the race by getting jobs as bicycle messengers. Winfred delivering a message to St. Clair at his hotel mistakes a voice he hears in St. Clair's room as Phyllis gets into a fight with him and hauled off to the pokey. The race starts without him with Clinton riding alone. Finally getting released from jail Winfred races on a "borrowed" bike to the "Velodrome" and enters the race just in time. An ether-saturated cloth caught in his rear-wheel spokes aids him more than a little as the other riders are overcome from the fumes when they try to pass him.
