Loek en Anke van den Boog wanted to do something for the third world and decided to start an foundation. Because there are already many organizations Loek en Anke wanted to do things differently. They started Net4Kids. Everyone who donates can choose the project he wants the money to go to. Hundred percent of his donation goes to the project he gets feedback and if he's not satisfied he can get his money back. Documentary maker Eveline van Dijck follows Loek en Anke at their projects in India and Nepal.
