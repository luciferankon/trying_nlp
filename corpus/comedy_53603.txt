The Ekipo Ja (Team Ja) is a group of gypsies directed by Juan de Dios who has a seal that fulfills desires. Everything is complicated when it appears "the Marquesa" (the Marquise") that tries to rob it. To achieve this he is accompanied by an Italian trafficker associated with the Russian Mafia. However the mission is not so easy in the face of the Ekipo's ability to complicate everything and to fend for themselves.
