After spending eight years in the farthest reaches of South America 30-year-old Herzl returns home to Israel. With no ambitions or prospects for the future he finds a job hanging posters across the country. Driving his a 1985 Volvo with a pile of dusty Israeli folk tapes on the dashboard and a worn copy of Robinson Crusoe by his side a young man journeys across the Israeli landscape coming to terms with the memories of what he left behind.
