At a dusty crossroads in the Soviet Union villagers surrender their possessions - a horse a samovar a goat - to the state.

She makes herself bracelets of burrs and studies herself in a cracked and cloudy mirror. Befriended by very few teased and tormented by many she seeks protection at a huge portrait of Stalin.
