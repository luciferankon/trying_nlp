America At Risk hosted by Newt and Callista Gingrich vividly demonstrates the dangers facing America one decade after the attacks on 9/11. Today Washington refuses to tell the truth about the war we are fighting. According to experts we are at war with radical Islamists - and it is a war we are losing. The Global War on Terror has been renamed the "Overseas Contingency Operation" by the Obama Administration. They have removed "Islamic extremism" and "jihad" from national security strategy documents. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has suggested we replace the word "terrorism" with "man-caused disasters." But how do we win a war with an enemy the Obama Administration refuses to identify? We are long overdue for a serious global strategy in fighting terrorism and the ideology behind it. We must have the courage to tell the truth and to act on that truth. It's time to be honest about what we know. From Writer/Director Kevin Knoblock and Executive Producer David N.
