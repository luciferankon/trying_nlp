Urban Tundra is an observational documentary about homelessness and faith. A very big snowstorm named Monica hits Tallinn Estonia in December 2010 and the film crew visits a soup kitchen opened for people in need. The film tries to observe the activities during Christmas holiday and document how people in need are coping with the ongoing storm.
