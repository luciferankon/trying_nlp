The documentary explores how an iconic piece of machinery helped shape music and society on both sides of the Atlantic in the '70s and '80s examining its place in the rise of hip-hop and punk. From The Boombox's origins as a 'sonic campfire' for urban youth to share music and ideas to its gradual re-appropriation in popular culture with the emergence of the Walkman MTV and the CD player the film considers how society's engagement with music has moved from a social to a more personal experience.
