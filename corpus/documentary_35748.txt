Inge Viett and María Barhoum are two women who at the end of the 1960s fought with conviction and without compromise to bring about a revolutionary change in their world: Inge Viett in the ^Ófirst world^Ô and María Barhoum in the third. They meet in Cuba in 1998: a location unfamiliar to both but which is nonetheless a sort of mirror to many of their experiences questions hopes and fears. The film refers to incidents in the life of Inge Viett in a Western European land Germany and the experiences of María Barhoum in the South American land of Uruguay. It tries to find the common thread that runs through their respective utopias in the different circumstances of two distant continents.
