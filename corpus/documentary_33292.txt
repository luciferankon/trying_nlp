Half-Tusk is the matriarch of a small family group of warthogs and has recently given birth to this season's litter three tiny females. Half-Tusk has never raised an entire litter to adulthood. Three powerful enemies have killed half her brood four years in a row: through a series of powerful flashbacks we watch the successful attacks of Lion Leopard and Cheetah and understand what's at stake for Half-Tusk this year. But past tragedy has made her strong. This year Half-Tusk manages to foil each new attack and keep her three young daughters safe; until one night when the family is split between two different burrows Leopard takes advantage and steals a baby away. It's one of the harsh lessons her youngsters must learn. Half-Tusk cannot be there all the time or anticipate every possible danger and as they grow they will have to face challenges alone. But her care and leadership has gives her youngsters the best start in life. It's the gift of every good mother.
