This is one of a series of admirable living pictures posed by competent artists and faithfully representing well-known art masterpieces. At the opening of each picture curtains are thrown aside by two pages the picture remains for a short interval in complete repose and the curtains are drawn. In other words these living pictures are shown exactly as in first-class vaudeville theatres and were prepared with equal care. "By the Sea" by Sarony. "The Tempest" by Landell.
