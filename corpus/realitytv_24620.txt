The men do not know the sum of the bet. The men carry out the assignment. Success in the assignment doubles the betting sum. Failure in the assignment deducts the betting sum. The same then takes place with the women. At the end of the two assignments (men and women) the couple who has accumulated the lowest sum of money is up for elimination from the villa. The third assignment is the Couples' Assignment which empowers the relationship and tests the cooperation between the partners. At the end of the Couples' Assignment two couples are up for elimination - the couple who came in last in the assignment and the couple that accumulated the lowest sum of money. The other couples vote and decide which of the two couples will remain in the villa and in the game. The eliminated couples leave the villa with nothing...
