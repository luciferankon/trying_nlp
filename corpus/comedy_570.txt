Bored with his "played out" life in Southern California a spirited surfer named Splash (Christian Porter) has wanderlust and seeks new turf for his heterosexual desires. An old hippie named Obie Franco Canobie (Frank Crivelli) misinforms Splash to travel to Provincetown Massachusetts because it was a Mecca for heterosexuals back in the 1960's. Upon his arrival Splash is constantly hit upon by gay men and his advances are rejected by many local lesbians. Just about to return back to California Splash runs into Axel (Mario Scaldini) the self-proclaimed "King of the Straight Scene". Soon Splash is introduced to the vivacious Jennifer (Liz Dennis) and the two fall for each other. The only problem is that Jennifer has a nerdy brother named Eugene (Bruce Estey) who is constantly hanging around her. In the mix of strange house parties at Axel's "Babe-crib" Axel is going through his own issues and in a mad dream sequence sells his soul to Satan in exchange for "all of the jail-bait he can handle." There is a beach party scene complete with an angry biker gang headed by a Mohawk wig-wearing biker named Arnie (Russell Meads). The story is narrated by the beautiful Braunwyn Jackett and introduced by Mr. "Tip Toe Thriugh The Tulips" himself Tiny Tim.
