In 2013 a beer historian with autism named Lance Rice left home on his own for the first time at the age of 55 and began a nationwide journey to pursue his dream to write a book about the history of American beer and give back to others with autism. With the support of generous people and breweries across the country Lance overcame incredible odds and traveled nearly 40000 miles over the next few years. Despite experiencing miraculous growth that helped inspire a movement to give hope to others with disabilities setbacks and heartbreaks in the years that followed brought Lance's journey to an end and put his lifelong dream at risk of never being fulfilled.
