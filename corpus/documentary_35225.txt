Three difficult month of Maidan! Ukrainian people united together at Kiev's historic square called Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) came out to voice theire feelings and emotions against the Yanukovich regime. Lots of souls were lost lots of destinies were changed! So much still to come... Ukrainian Revolution of dignity.
