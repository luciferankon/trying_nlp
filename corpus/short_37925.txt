In this advertising short for the milk industry Austrian comedic actor Josef Holub repeats as the hapless Seff. He tries to woo Mary but she rejects him because of his scrawny physique. Seff searches for health and wellness among various kinds of athletes (track and field gymnasts swimmers) and they all tell him he needs to drink more milk and eat more cheese. In the end a much buffer Seff gets the girl. The title and sports scenes are a play off of the famous 1925 film Wege zur Kraft und Sch√∂nheit.
