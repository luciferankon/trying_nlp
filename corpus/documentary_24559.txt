Returning Citizens focuses on a passionate group of individuals who are looking for a second chance - or perhaps a chance they never had to begin with. Taking place in Southeast Washington DC the film offers a humanizing perspective on a community that has been negatively impacted by mass incarceration. From freshly returning individuals struggling to rebuild their lives to community leaders working to end the on-going cycle of crime and violence the stories unveiled in "Returning Citizens" offer proof that change is possible when the right opportunities are presented.
