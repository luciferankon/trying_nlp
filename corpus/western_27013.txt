Having helped his father escape the law Jim Curtis heads north with the Marshal chasing him. He and his pal Snicker elude the Marshall by changing clothes with two actors. Now forced to do vaudeville skits Jim finds the man responsible for his and his father's problem working in the same saloon. Escaped convict Jim Curtis determined to prove his innocence heads for Gold Creek with his friend Snicker Kimble hunting the man for whose crime Jim was jailed. They enter the town disguised as a traveling vaudeville act (with Jim wearing the worse hat even seen in a western film.) With the aid of his friend and Mary Jackson Jim proves that a man named Stanton is really the gambler Arnold for whom he is hunting.
