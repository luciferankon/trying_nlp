Sheriff "Emmy" Ellis is as dusty and desolate as the Mexican/American border she patrols -- until she recognizes a miracle -- 3 illegal women suddenly become 3 illegal mothers through a divine intervention. The chaos creates a bond between Emmy and the newborns as she realizes the mystery -- the spirits of those who died while attempting to cross the glorious Rio Grande are returning through women who come in contact with its waters; and with menopause on her heels Emmy decides to create a family of her own.
