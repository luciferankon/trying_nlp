Kaspar is in a state of misery and panic and there seems to be nothing to save him. He was brought up in a highly religious family and disregards his beliefs when he leaves home. His only relief after being in this state is the peace he finds while looking at his grass hoppers. We follow Kaspar intimately throughout this nightmarish state over a two day span through his encounters with friends/family and strangers in the night in where he confronts his system of beliefs and tries to find redemption out of what he sees in a world where the seen has lost its significance.
