BOOTLEG COWBOYS is the story of concert bootleggers and their fight to document hard rock music history against all odds. Blamed for destroying the music industry and being lumped in with pirates and scalpers they went to extraordinary lengths in order to film these much sought after live events. Resourceful thrill seeking ingenious and enterprising "tapers" found themselves being very small fish in a large pond and vilified by everyone from the music industry to the FBI and all for little to no money to show for it they risked it all to supply fans with that little bit "extra".
