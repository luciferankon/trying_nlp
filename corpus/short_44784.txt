The issue of homelessness is overlooked far too often. Society rarely realizes that the people on the street have a story and a past and more importantly they have a future. Our project aims to uncover the struggle the homeless endure and what it is like to go from living on the streets to working and having a place to call home. Haven sheds light on the issue of identity in the homeless community and by profiling people as they overcome the obstacles that surface when rising above homelessness it captures that experience on a first hand basis. The Columbus House is a non-for-profit organization in New Haven Connecticut dedicated to helping the homeless in their community by providing shelter and fostering their personal growth and independence. This organization is a part of Interfaith Cooperative Ministries which is a culmination of congregations and organizations dedicated to helping those in need in New Haven. The Columbus house runs a program called Abraham's Tent. This program selects several men each winter who show a true drive and determination to turn their lives around. The men are provided with necessities like food transportation sleeping arrangements and are housed each week at various congregations in New Haven. During this time the program provides each man with a case manager who helps him to find a job and assists him in looking for a permanent home after Abraham's Tent. With the help of The Columbus House Haven gives an exclusive look into the lives of these men who are fighting to regain their independence.
