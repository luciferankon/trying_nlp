A 70's and 80's style feature filmed and edited to look like the exploitation grindhouse films of that era complete with trailers and film reel damage. The feature follows a series of exploitation trailers and popcorn ads to give you the feel of going to see a movie in the theater or drive-in back in the day. The film follows a detective a rookie officer a waitress a reporter and a hit man stopping a cult from taking over with a legion of the walking dead. As the five attempt to survive the night hope for mankind quickly dwindles into a bleak and uncertain future.
