Set in Noel Edmonds' fictitious grand house in the equally fictitious town of Crinkley Bottom the show centres around games involving the studio audience and special guest celebrities. Contestants can "grab a grand" home viewers can be caught out live in their own homes and celebrities get their just desserts in the gunge tank.
