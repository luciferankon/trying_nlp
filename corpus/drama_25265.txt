Bratetza Svezhia Kucheto and Lacho are a group of friends who spend the summer with three girls on a secluded beach and live in a deserted anglers' hut. They create their own world of comedy irony and an escape from the monotony of everyday life. In ten years we meet them again yet this time it is just three of them - Lacho is no longer alive. He killed himself and the rest have a hard time getting over the loss each in his own way. They miss the boy they shared so many moments of true happiness and spiritual growth with. Without him they just settle for a mundane existence.
