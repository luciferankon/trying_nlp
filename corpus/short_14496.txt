Art department assistant Dave Stevens and runner Simon Grey have been asked to record a dvd commentary for Lucy Joyce' film Secret Talking. Things go wrong immediately however when Dave calls Lucy a cow and Simon agrees completely. The sound man is quick to interrupt and ask the guys politely to talk about the movie. They try again and again but these two seem to just want to talk about anything as long as it's not about Secret Talking.
