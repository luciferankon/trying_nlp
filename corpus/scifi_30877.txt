In the year 2250 engineer Ava Turing is one of 6 members of a research team sent by the International Space Agency (ISA) to excavate and study Jupiter's moon Europa. Once they arrive Ava remains in cryogenic stasis orbiting Europa while the other team members are woken up to establish their base and begin their studies on the moon itself. Ava was scheduled to wake once the base is completed but sometime later Ava is woken up early by the Technical Operations Machine (T.O.M.) an artificial intelligence that monitors the project. T.O.M. tells Ava that contact with the ground team has been lost and that she is the their only hope of rescue. She quickly sets out to find her friends on the icy surface of Europa.
