My daughter's name is Maya. I've been told that the word maya means illusion in Hindu philosophy. In 2001 I photographed her at six years old spinning like a top around me. Even then I realized that her childhood was not something I could grasp but rather - like the wind - something I could feel tenderly brushing across my cheek. Eleven years later I pull out my 16mm Bolex camera once again and she allows me to film her - different but somehow the same.
