Up close and personal with husband and wife Gus and Grace Ridley - a documentary filmed at their home. Gus sits on the sofa and talks about being the world's oldest pothead who started smoking in 1936. The camera cuts back and forth between Gus and Grace: he talks about what a great driver he is she says he's a lousy driver. He smokes everywhere but in the shower. Then Grace lets us in on the secret of their marriage and how she is able to keep communication front and center in their relationship.
