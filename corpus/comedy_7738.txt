Kim's mother believes being a debutantee should be the most important thing in a young woman's live. So she makes a big fuss about it and gets on Kim's nerves.

She asks out a guy she hardly knows and who - worse for her mother - is Latino. Her mother and Scott try anything to prevent her from this "social suicide".
