Keelin loses her husband when he goes out to sea and only his oar and row boat come back. She moves away from Ireland's mainland to another remote little isle to resume a new life with her daughter Clothra. Their new lake front home brings more to them than gold coins as Keelin will soon learn that life and death are in the ways of water as well as loss and new love. Original Screenplay by Kishe Caelan Wallace
