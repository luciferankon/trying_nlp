In August 1903 the King of Portugal D.Carlos I proceeds to by Royal Charter the auction sale of the Fort St. Joseph - located in a small islet near the city of Funchal. In October 2000 the old fort is acquired by professor Renato Barros without him even knowing that the Royal Charter documented not only the sale of the property but also the domain over the islet. Overnight the professor becomes the Prince.
