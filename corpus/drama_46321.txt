George Milton and Lennie Small are migrant workers in the 1930s Depression. Lennie is mentally disabled and George looks after him. While working as hands on a Western ranch they dream of owning their own ranch and the opportunity may be available. Their current ranch is owned by a sadistic man who has a flirtatious wife. A man with the size and strength of a giant but the mind of a child and his level-headed friend wander around Central California looking for work only to end up at a ranch owned by a man whose sadistic son and flirtatious daughter-in-law ruin things for everyone. George and half-wit Lennie work on a western ranch during the Great Depression dreaming of the autonomy of owning and operating their own ranch some day.
