Crossing Liverpool as almost an alien landscape they instantaneously find themselves lost. Their journey is both intently focused and dreamlike and takes them not only across Liverpool but across their own consciousness. Dylan meets a girl called April who claims to know the way to Priory Road. April joins them on their journey but her presence upsets Kendrick. He becomes increasingly paranoid and suspects the girl's motives yet can't help but be intrigued by her. Events rapidly become surreal and sinister when the trio meet the enigmatic Coffeeman at Bridgehouse a house supposedly located where Priory Road used to be. April Kendrick and Dylan are pushed to their limits both physically and emotionally as what seemed like a simple delivery task becomes something far more complex.
