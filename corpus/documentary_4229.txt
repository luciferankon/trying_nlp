A series of ten programmes each featuring three historic buildings in the UK in need of restoration. For each building there is an advocate (usually a celebrity of some sort) who states the case for restoration and each site is assessed by two 'experts'. The public vote for the building they consider the most deserving of restoration and the 'winner' is announced in a live final at the end of the series.
