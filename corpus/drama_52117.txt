A caravan escorts an elderly and dying Sheikh through the Moroccan Atlas. His last wish is to be buried with his close ones. But death does not wait. The caravaners fearful of the mountain refuse to continue transporting the corpse. Saƒèd and Ahmed two rogues traveling with the caravan say they know the way and promise to take the corpse to its destiny. In another world Shakib is chosen to travel to the mountains with a mission: to help the improvised caravaners.
