Although I have worked my whole life Ferdinand Mennecke says "the retirement pay does not suffice as one half is already spent on expenses. There is not much left to treat oneself to something." Therefore the 84-year old delivers papers - six days a week always in the middle of the night in all weathers. "In the past I went to Majorca once or even twice a year. But today I don't have enough money for this. From time to time I try to get the money together for a vacation but then there is a back payment for the heating or the telephone bill and the money is gone." Ferdinand Mennecke is one of more than 760000 people over 65 years in Germany who are working in a side job. Werner Kofalck is also working because his retirement pay does not suffice. With 85 years he is still sitting in a taxi driving passengers through Hamburg. He says that he does not have a choice: "If you are my age there is nothing else to do. In the past I worked in totally different jobs but I could not work in any of these jobs today. Who employs people this age?" Therefore he labors week by week instead of enjoying his retirement.
