Noel Godin and Jan Bucquoy are two Belgians who after both having had a less than successful love life and a rather messy artistic career embark on an assault of the showbizz world via the Cannes Film Festival. This universe where image unscrupulously manipulates substance will become the theatre for a conflict between the generations through a number of motley encounters. These encounters are often bittersweet yet always touching. In this romanticized documentary the almost frantic quest for love and youth portrays a refusal to accept the passing of time and the end of it which inevitably follows.
