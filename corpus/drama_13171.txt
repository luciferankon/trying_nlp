Friedrich Mitterer (Werner Krauss) is the star of the Viennese Burg Theater. The eccentric and basically socio-phobic star. He has the prompter Sedlmayer (Hans Moser) take care of most of his social interactions. Even when he meets the young Leni (Hortense Raky) who finds really charming he relies on Sedlmayer to establish contact. With these social skills it's no wonder that he doesn't notice that Leni is head over heels for the aspiring actor Josef (Willy Eichberger). When Leni finds an invitation for the Baroness Seebach's (Olga Tschechowa) weekly party for the rich and famous at Mitterer's place she steals it without thinking and gives it to Josef setting quite a few things in motion.
