Golliwog appears seated in his brown boot which he drives as he would an automobile steering with great agility. Boot brushes polish the "car" first with a coat of black then brown and then yellow. Golliwog in examining his "car" is hit by another "machine." Out of his leg pour sawdust and shavings in a stream. With a handsaw the cause of the accident performs an amputation. With a boot lace the injured "machine" is taken in tow to Golliwog's home where the family is much upset by the mishap.
