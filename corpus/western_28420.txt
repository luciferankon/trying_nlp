Nikkos(Al Bridge) deposits a trinket from a robbery/murder committed by he and Bud Warren(Eddie Fetherston) but Juanita when pressed points the finger at Boston Harry as it is hard for a girl such as Juanita who gets many trinkets to keep up with just who among the general population added to her trinket collection and when.The locals are about to string Harry up but he is saved by Steve and they light out for friendlier surroundings in another town. There they meet storekeeper Ma Warren(Florence Turner) and her pretty daughter Sally(Frances Morris) and Steve and Harry start vieing for her attentions with Steve in the lead after he sings "I Fell in Love With You" to her and Harry hasn't much to counter with as Sally is not a trinket-favoring girl.But not all is well for Sally's brother Bud is also part of the family storekeeping business when he isn't pulling robberies in near-by towns with his accented partner Nikkos and he begins to fret over the possibility that Steve and Harry will learn that he was part of the affair in the other town that led to Steve and Harry's hasty departure. Nikkos has a plan to ensure that doesn't happen.
