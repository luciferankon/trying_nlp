A small mining town in Northern Minnesota obsesses over their high school hockey team even though it's been many years since they once dominated the State of Hockey. The fortunes of their town and hockey team have paralleled the ups and downs of the mining industry which has been perishing. This season brings added significance and pressure as the head coach Jake Murray prepares to coach a team that includes his two sons Brooks and Tate Murray. Even Jake's calm wife Wenona is feeling the rising tensions in their home and community. The oldest son Brooks is a senior. He has worked hard in pursuit of his dream to play college hockey at Harvard. Tate is a sophomore and his aspirations have been limited to girls and fishing. After another disappointing start that is riddled with challenges both on and off the ice Jake learns that more than just his team is failing. A battle with terminal cancer will make this his final season. As Jake struggles to accept his fate he finds a sense of peace and purpose from his wife's Ojibwe wisdom. He learns to "be present" and embraces the "way of the warrior" as a father husband teacher and coach. The entire community is shaken by the news of Jake's health condition but his new outlook and approach serves to deeply inspire his family friends students and players. The coach instills in his team - and by proxy the town itself - a renewed sense of self-respect and honor. Bonded by their proud history and a greater appreciation of their future the team rallies together for an improbable and magical run that culminates with a state championship.
