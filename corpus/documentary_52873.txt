A docu-reality series sponsored by the EU and deals with the life in Europe and its ties to Israel in an amusing way through trial and error and integration in local life. In this series two people - one from Israel and the other from a member country of the EU will exchange their lives. The basis of each exchange is the prospective jobs of the two participants. As each exchange takes place particular attention will be paid to both the every-day routine of the participants and their prospective jobs. At the end of the exchange (which takes approximately a week) each participant will be faced with a "professional" challenge reflecting what they have learned. Trading places incorporates a young and entertaining format with varied ?content that appeals both to the Europeans viewers and the Israelis since there is nothing more typically Israeli than taking a trip to ?a foreign country and comparing the life "here" with the life "over there".
