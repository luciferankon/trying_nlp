An older union leader takes the heat as times are changing in his 1960s company. The modern union wants to change the leadership without realizing how far their leader has brought them since the 1930s. The relationship between the union members and the union leaders' son become problematic in the process. As thing heat up both sides share their views with the old union leader speaking his mind and generally winning the heated debate. Only problem is that his son (now grown) won't forgive his father for always putting the union above his role as parent.
