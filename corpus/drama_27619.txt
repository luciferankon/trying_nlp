One of original histories but of Alberto Migre. Considered one remake of "0597 DA OCUPADO" this soap opera was first in approaching the experiences of the women in a jail. With a cast carefully selected an impeccable direction of Martin Clutet and the magisterial hand of Migre; controlling each one of the details. In cast they stand out Blanca Lagrotta Nelly Prono (in an unforgettable personage) Susana Freyre Hilda Bernard and Susy Kent interpreting the evil Director of the jail. In this soap opera Migre; summons to Fanny Navarro at that time forgotten and persecuted.
