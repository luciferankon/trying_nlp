Wineskin's sold out The Great American Album CD release show at Puck on June 7th 2008 is finally here. Based in the foothills of Bucks County Wineskin is an ever-evolving musical machine. The band is a four piece and often greater than the sum of its parts. Proudly waving the flag of rock-n-roll they craft songs from the unique fabric it comes from. They deconstruct the American musical landscape and draw on it's rich heritage and genres. From slow country ballads to riff driven rock songs. They can play a ragtime feeling tune and in the next minute sound like a space ship hovering over your house.
