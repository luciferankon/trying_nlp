This documentary film portrays five captains. It shows their everyday life on board and how they fulfill their duties and make decisions. But it goes far beyond: Viewers get to know the captains as people with values as human beings that also deal with topics such as family and home. The captains' stories tell a lot more than about life at sea. The narrative style is documentary in the classical sense: It is only the captains who speak there is no voiceover. Their own words and the pictures let viewers gain a very close insight into the captains' lives. Hamburg the German port known as "gate to the world" creates the cinematic parenthesis of this documentary. All captains portrayed have a close relation to Hamburg - they live or work there or come to Hamburg with their ships every now and then.
