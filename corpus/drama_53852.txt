While slouched in a toilet cubicle drunk and half asleep in the bar where he works as a musician a woman gives Marvin a request to write a song. It turns out to be from his wife who has been dead 12 months. The next few days of his life are spent trying to write the song to come to terms with his grief and to re-evaluate and take stock of what he has and needs. Friends and rivals help him to make his decisions. Marvin's song is an existential love story of loss and grief set against a Lancashire landscape.
