Narrated by Robert Powell 'The Forgotten Children of Congo' was filmed over four weeks in the Democratic Republic of Congo. From the remoteness of the Congo Basin to the capital Kinshasa and the volatile Ituri Province in the East this powerful and sometimes harrowing documentary focuses on the plight of the country's street children many of whom were found to be involved in witchcraft cannibalism and as child soldiers. Unlike many other documentaries filmed in volatile regions of Africa 'The Forgotten Children of Congo' managed to shoot extensively throughout the night and also capture an actual exorcism of a child at midnight in a remote region of the country.
