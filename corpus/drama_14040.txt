After superstar NFL quarterback ROMAN CHRISTOPHE says goodbye to a cheating wife he takes an opportunity to re-acquaint himself with his eight year old daughter CHRISTIAN and her mother POLLY. Without hesitation Roman makes his intentions clear. He wants to reconcile. The tranquil yet spunky town of William Moss West Virginia is soon overwhelmed upon the arrival of mega-star athlete Roman Christophe. Business at the town's only coffee and pastry shop has never been better. However not nearly as star struck as her easily impressed community at large; Polly shop owner makes it perfectly clear that even amidst the sudden increase in revenue a reconciliation with the three time Super Bowl MVP is absolutely out of the question. The shit hits the fan when Roman finally accepting Polly's ill affection begins courting ALLISON PARKER his daughter's third grade teacher. In the meantime Polly obviously oblivious to the town's newest romantic item begins to shrug her disdain for Roman. The thought of a life with he and Christian seems more like a happy ending rather than a spiteful ending. Needless to say sparks can be seen clear across the county when Polly runs into Roman and Ms. Parker in the unmentionable section of the William Moss drug store. When the dust finally settles the town that nestles itself 200 miles south of Washington D.C. and a million miles from the rest of the world will never be the same.
