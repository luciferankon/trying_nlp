Joseph falls into winter in New Brunswick Canada. In New Brunswick -- Canada's only official bi-lingual province -- the English and French Acadian thrive in perfect harmony. This episode features a bi-cultural bi-seasonal view of this beautiful Atlantic province. New Brunswick is also a four-season destination and at no time is it more beautiful than in the Fall -- when the hordes of tourists have gone home and you have the great leaf change to yourself. During his fall visit Joseph visits the "living museum" King's Landing and samples the British Loyalist life of the 1800's. He also travels the rivers and streams of the north in search of New Brunswick's brilliant colors. Joseph returns to New Brunswick for a winter adventure that includes dog sledding ice skating ice fishing snowmobiling along snowy trails to small villages and para-sailing -- on a frozen lake. In New Brunswick each season has its own activities and attractions -- but it's the people the visitors remember. In the winter they teach us that no matter what the conditions outside are -- life is for celebrating. Rather than focusing on the limitations you embrace the opportunities.
