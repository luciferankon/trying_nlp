From the land of narco-violence to the land of displaced persons. The documentary Guerras Ajenas ('Wars of Others') explores the consequences of the war on drugs in Colombia and one of its main tools: aerial spraying. Through a historical review together with opinions of participants in the events and experts on the matter we will come to know the origin of the so-called "Plan Colombia" we will hear the denunciations of Colombian peasants and indigenous individuals who have been displaced and affected by the aerial spraying of illegal crops; and the views of government representatives and diplomats who defend its use and explore the complexity of the issue. At present Colombia ranks as second in the world after Syria in the number of displaced persons and although the fumigation has stopped after the World Health Organization declared glyphosate a probable carcinogen the fight for truth and justice goes on.
