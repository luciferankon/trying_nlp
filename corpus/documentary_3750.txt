Transoceanic letters is an epistolary film between two cities Barcelona and Buenos Aires between two friends who want to continue making movies together despite the distance. The film arises from the need both to continue filming and seeing the other city. Through skypes and letters we are creating a discourse about the structure of the film and narrative possibilities of the epistolary format. A coming and going from the past to the present from the city remembered to the vivid city. A reflection on memory distance the House concept and cinema.
