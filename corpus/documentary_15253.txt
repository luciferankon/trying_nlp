In the ward of renal transplantation department of the largest hospital in the world stories beyond anyone's imagination go on and on every day. Uremia patients' kidneys can not function normally unless depending on the dialysis to educe water and toxin out of their bodies otherwise they will be dead. However having a new compatible kidney and living a normal life again after the transplant surgery are fairly luxury wishes for them as it is not purely a issue of money. Protagonists' emotions and inner activities experienced radical changes in this film: the overwhelming emotional impact of finding out the new kidney given by his father hardly working after the surgery the mental breakdown led by numerous failures in tissue-typing the sudden death after a successful transplant surgery......the tearing pain and desperate struggle the optimist and the tough mind all piece together a picture of uremia patients and their families.
