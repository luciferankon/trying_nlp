Dumitru Stanciu is one of the last mountain shepherds of Europe. As his forefathers did for thousands of years in summer as in winter he and his herd of sheep roam the far reaches of the Transylvanian Carpathian Mountains close to the edge of heaven. He lives amidst the myths of his mountains between bears and wolves in the sun wind snow and ice - and in constant concern for his animals... Soon when he hangs his sheepskin coat on the wall for the last time an irretrievable piece of Old Europe shall die. Or will his son Radu take over the herd?
