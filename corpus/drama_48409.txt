Napoleon the Second L'Aiglon was a prisoner.And in a prison you can't escape from cause your jail is your own-Austrian - family.He underwent a brainwashing: he had to forget everything from the French language to his Tuileries memories.His dream was to come back to his native France where he had kept many supporters ready to help him to regain his father Napoleon 's throne.But his poor health never gave him any respite .He went from his cradle to the grave at 21.His political role was to serve as Metternich's scarecrow to keep Europa at bay.
