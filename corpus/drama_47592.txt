Significant Strangers explores the lives of quadruplet brothers separated at birth who reunite for the first time in 25 years. Inspired by true events the series introduces the four brothers through a documentary team who locate the quadruplets living in both Australia and America to document their divergent lives since separation and orchestrate a reunion on their shared birthdays. The four brothers Jamie Tommy Matt and Jeremy all played by Kipan Rothbury are each asked to share their views on love life and everything they know as the date of their first meeting draws near. The documentary style series examines the concept of Nature vs Nurture and questions whether we are defined in our lives primarily by our experiences or our genetics. The series uses verbatim techniques by recording observing and directly transcribing actual interviews with four young men to portray their contrasting experiences growing up in a contemporary world. Significant Strangers offers an insight into the differences and similarities within people's lives. It gives an honest representation of four genetically similar people that have been brought up in vastly different environments.
