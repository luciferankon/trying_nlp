Phil Stanley (William Fairbanks) and Harry Hartley (Edmond Cobb) are traveling toward Alaska when they come to a town controlled by scoundrels. The leaders of the town banish Phil and Harry but they refuse to leave and send Glory (Ena Gregory) to summon the sheriff from a neighboring town to assist them. The sheriff comes to Phil's rescue and arrests the town council of scoundrels.
