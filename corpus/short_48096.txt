The opening scene shows the interior of a home where a man and his wife are at dinner but on this particular occasion they are very much at swords' points with each other and after a general "rough house" in which both equally participate the man makes a bolt from the place. The wife is left alone to air her feelings and picking up a paper she reads of a masked ball that is to be given that night at a fashionable hotel. Disgusted with everything and determined to seek a diversion she makes preparations to go to the ball. Hailing a cab she enters it and soon is in the midst of the gay festivities. The husband in the meantime makes up his mind to attend the same ball so after going to a costumer where he fits himself out in a fancy suit he too makes for the scene of splendor. Hardly has he arrived when he spies this prim little woman who is well disguised and after a short flirtation the pair become very chummy. The man invites his charming partner to partake of some refreshments which she graciously accepts and the happy pair are in high glee mingling with the crowd of revelers and never for a moment suspecting each other's identity. Finally they retire to a private dining-room to have a little supper and when alone they agree to remove their masks; so off they come and there facing each other are man and wife. They each treat the episode as a great joke and after talking matters over they decide to patch up their little misunderstanding and live happy in the future.
