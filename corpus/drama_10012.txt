PSD is a true story based loosely on the experiences in the life of writer director and producer- Sylvia "SylkyDiva" Wilson. Revealing the lack of social acceptance that many Plus Size Women alike face today- this is a story to be told. Brace yourself for an intense yet inspiring journey as we follow the everyday lives of nine musically talented Plus Size Divas and a little Divette who struggles to find self-love in a world where discrimination bullying and size-acceptance are an endless constant battle.

Optimistic and determined to find success these Divas will stop at nothing to let their lights shine even through the midst of the darkest circumstances.
