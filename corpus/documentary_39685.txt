Some people dream big dreams. Only a few bold adventurers live them. Two such adventurers are Denis Belliveau and Francis O'Donnell who took a wild idea - they wanted to retrace Marco Polo's entire 25000 mile land-and-sea route from Venice to China and back - and spent two incredible years of their lives trying to turn it into reality. IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF MARCO POLO chronicles the extraordinary journey of two ordinary guys - Denis at the time a wedding photographer Francis an artist and U.S. Marine veteran -- as they venture on foot on horseback on camel-back in jeeps and trucks and boats and trains through Venice Turkey Iran Afghanistan several former republics of the Soviet Union China Indonesia and India.
