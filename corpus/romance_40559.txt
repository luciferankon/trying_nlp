A happy go lucky protagonist tries to embark on a secret road-trip on his Royal Enfield. He has eyes for his sister's classmate but constrains himself to open up at a later point of time. On a road trip with his girl as days pass and nights are spent in random strangers' place they witness nature's expanse through its length and breadth. However things take a turn for the worse as they encounter something unexpected. The reel opens with the snapshots of Muralidharan(Simbu) in a small brawl with a mob which later reveals that he had been quarreling with the men for molesting his sister Maitreyi. Being a retarded glimpse it's a Gautam Menon movie with a breezy start where Maitreyi's friend Leela(Manjima Mohan) gets adhesively attached to Murali where she later agrees to go on a road trip to Kanyakumari where they later travel to Kolhapur Maharashtra (Leela's hometown) Suddenly they meet an unexpected road accident which doesn't seem fatal but injures Murali and breaks his shoulder. They feel something was wrong and that wasn't an accident. The same day Leela's parents were injured and her father doesn't seem to get alive again. They come to know that it was a plan to kill Leela which ends the first half.. The second half is a well furnished racy plot clearly dispenses the fearless-ness to destroy the corrupt Politician and Police Officer Kamat (Baba Sehgal) Finally Murali is revealed that he is Rajnikanth Muralidharan IPS who attains his posting in the same Kolhapur where Leela's parents were killed. Finally he assassinates Kamat and goes on a trip to Kanyakumari again with Leela with a beautiful proposal.
