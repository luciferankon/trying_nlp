In a pattern that many domestic sitcoms would follow over the next 15 years the plotlines followed the exploits of zany Mary Kay. Her husband Johnny was a sane sensible banker who had to rescue her from herself. (The Stearns were married in real life.) In December 1948 Mary Kay gave birth to son Christopher. Because Mary Kay's pregnancy was hard to hide his birth was incorporated into the show. Shortly after New Year's Day 1949 Christopher was written into the show as a character. During shooting he either lay in his bassinet or was held by one of the Stearns or Mary Kay's mother. Shot live in New York where it was set. Sponsored by Anacin.
