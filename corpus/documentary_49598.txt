In 1972 director Norman Jewison took a group of young actors singers and dancers to war-torn Israel to shoot the film adaptation of the hit rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar. Filming on location and walking in the footsteps of the actual Biblical characters that they were portraying not only made an impact on these performers but on audiences worldwide who 40 years later still watch annually and love this cinematic presentation. This is their story... in their own words!
