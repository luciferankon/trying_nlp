There is a clich√© used to describe the Czech historian Konstantin Jirechek: Friend of Bulgaria. This film tells about a man and a scientist of more complex attitudes towards the Bulgarians. His observations are valid even today. Some of them are quite negative. And yet that is what true friends are for they are the ones we need to encounter more often.
