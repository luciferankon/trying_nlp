Between 1943 and 1954 350000 Italians had to abandon their native land in the provinces - then Italian - of Pula Rijeka and Zara to escape the persecution and the process of streamlining those territories by the Yugoslav regime established by Marshal Tito. It was a true "ethnic cleansing" carried out with a series of massacres of civilians and military personnel (many thrown into the foibe) started in Istria and Dalmatia in 1943 after the armistice of September 8 and completed in May 1945 in then when the troops of the former Yugoslavia invaded all Venice Giulia then to Udine. This story made up of horrors sacrifices and heroisms of simple people torn from the most memorable memories of places inhabited for centuries by Italian populations has for fifty years been totally forgotten and concealed for generations and the public opinion of the country . This is a series of two episodes in which those events are rebuilt with authentic cinematic footage with precious repertoire footage and with the help of over 100 testimonies of high emotion of men and women who have experienced those dramatic events. The documentary also uses the authoritative contribution of Paolo Mieli and Gianni Oliva.
