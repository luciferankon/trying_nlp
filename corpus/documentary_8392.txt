'There is no Profit in a Cure': One out of every seven people is afflicted with the physiological disease of addiction; more than those suffering from heart conditions diabetes or cancer combined. Over 700000 people seek treatment for addiction in the United States every day. There is hardly anyone who has not been affected by the ravages caused by the fallout of this misunderstood disease. It is a silent epidemic which is spreading worldwide and there are those who would profit from this deadly disease. The addiction treatment industry in America had revenues of $34 billion by the end of 2014 which is an increase of 55% over the total from 2005. There are currently 11000 addiction-treatment centers in the United States with some high-end facilities charging clients upwards of $50000 a month. A lot of these facilities never properly treat the underlying conditions causing so many people to face a revolving door where they are encouraged to relapse to stay within the system. So many are also never educated to treatments that could actually help with their addictions such as natural remedies that are on the leading edge of treatment. Many of these treatments are not being used to their fullest potential because there is no profit in a cure. It's time for a change. And RECOVER is that spark for a change.
