Actually "Love Life" begins with a very idyllic picture. Ya'ara (Netta Garti) prepares an outdoor picnic for the birthday of her father Leon (Stephen Singer). But there is a wind that mixes up the whole beautifully arranged ensemble. With this gust of wind Arie (Rade Sherbedgia) has returned to Jerusalem which he had left for 30 years. This surprised Ya'ara as she rushes to her parents full of concern. Previously Ya'ara's life was okay. Happily married to Joni (Ishai Golan) Jara has good prospects for early employment at the university. But already the first encounter with Arie throws Jara off track. In the following meetings a real affair develops out of the initially erotically charged situations.
