When human activity causes bear cubs to be separated from or abandoned by their mothers they have no chance of surviving unless people intervene. Russia's Orphan Bear Rescue Center has been established to save and nurture orphaned bear cubs. The center is a part of a larger organization - the International Fund for Animal Welfare that rescues and protects animals worldwide.
