The devilish residents of the Village of Tigers led by Hu Jiao plan to kill Lo Hong Shun otherwise known as the heroic Sword of the Southern Sky. Their attempts thus far have failed and the most recent mistaken identity sees them looking for another way to achieve this goal. Meanwhile the nearby Ba family are a much more righteous group with the wisdom of Granny Ba the style and sword skills of 9th Miss Ba and the enthusiasm of son Master Ba. While Granny enjoys the good wishes of all on her birthday Miss Ba has her hands full - not only does she discover her honorable brother helping Hu Jiao in his dastardly deeds but she also believes she has been robbed by a traveler that she gave assistance to (not knowing that this man was Lo Hong Shun). Add to all this relative Ying Hua in affection for Lo Hong Shun Hu Jiao sees a way to use the righteousness of the Ba family to help him kill the hero Lo by turning them against him - but will righteousness prevail?
