Valerie tends her garden in suburban Connecticut methodically collecting the snails and then crushing them. Her life is solitary and quiet but on the train to her job in the city she sits across from a glamorous woman about whom she begins to fantasize fantasies that are anything but solitary and quiet. Later that day she sees the woman ordering lunch at a deli and watches her rebuff two louts who hit on her. The fantasy builds and then who walks into the pet shop where Valerie works? It's the glamorous woman and she wants to buy a hamster. What happens next may fulfill Valerie's fantasies.
