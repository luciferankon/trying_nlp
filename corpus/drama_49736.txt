Anne (Juliette Binoche) a well-off Paris-based mother of two and investigative journalist for ELLE is writing an article about student prostitution. Her meetings with two fiercely independent young women Alicja (Joanna Kulig) and Charlotte (Anais Demoustier) are profound and unsettling moving her to question her most intimate convictions about money family and sex. In Paris Elle Magazine's journalist Anne is assigned to write a four-page article about prostitution. Anne is a middle class mother and housewife that lives a routine life in a comfortable apartment with her husband Patrick and her two sons the teenager Florent and the boy St√©phane. Anne contacts the college students and call-girls Charlotte "Lola" and Alicja and she interviews them. They tell details of their sexual experience with their clients most of them married and aged enough to be their fathers who are seeking kinky sex that they do not do with their wives. In the beginning Anne is shocked with the humiliations and perversions that the girls are submitted to keep their lifestyles. But soon she realizes how tedious her life is and she fantasizes sexual encounters with their clients. Further she changes her opinion and attitude towards the girls that have good time in their lives with their independence. But in the end she wears the society mask and returns to her routine life with her family.
