As an abused child Anastasia would close her eyes and picture sitting in the middle of a field. Following a breakdown she rents an abandoned farm as a haven of peace hoping isolation will help her tackle her demons. Anastasia's mother Susan appears at the farm many times during Anna's stay. Their relationship is a struggle as a mysterious decision from the past hangs over them. Anastasia has conversations with her mother even when she's not 'physically' there making her mental state questionable. Matthew the farmer renting the property to Anna happens to be young and attractive. There's chemistry between them but Anastasia doesn't want to give in at first. And Matthew is a polite country boy- or so we think.
