Conspiracy. Power. Sex. Golf? Ah the Pennytree Golf Club. 18 holes at its finest. If you played there in the late-70's. Now run-down and nearly deserted only a few faithful duffers keep club owner Josh Pennytree and his drop-dead-gorgeous granddaughter Liberty in business. All the other customers fled to the Bentwood Country Club nearby; awesome to behold even if it's run by sleazy stuck-up land baron Simon Roosevelt. Stealing the former Pennytree crowd isn't enough for Simon; he's scheming to take over the Pennytree property for a lucrative condo complex. Liberty gets wise to Simon's scam - and gets fightin' mad. Though Liberty can't compete with deep pockets she CAN compete with a new staff of gorgeous babes and bold hunks! Scouting the dance and strip clubs and finding the hottest bodies on the beach Liberty gives Pennytree a new start. New services guaranteed to do absolutely nothing for your handicap but leave you wanting more. Hot uniforms massages and the legendary cart wash even though golf carts don't REALLY get that dirty (wink wink!)...not that there's anything wrong with that! Busloads of new customers suddenly appear and the money's rolling in. Even Simon's spies are giving in to their wildest desires at Pennytree. Trouble's still ahead as misunderstandings arise between Liberty and her boyfriend handsome co-worker Neil Walker. Simon finally raises the ante with a winner-take-all challenge: one round of golf. Bentwood's best vs Pennytree's best. Winner gets the loser's property. It's up to legendary golf pro Dwayne Rider to save the day for Pennytree... if he can still hold a club after a hearty breakfast of bourbon...hold the eggs. Bentwood's star player - Steve Shank inclined to play dirty and a weakness for beautiful women. Who will get the stroke... and who will get the shaft? Golf will never be the same!
