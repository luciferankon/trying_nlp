Jack sneaks out of his house late at night and walks the streets of the city. People and places he encounters on his walk help him to come to terms with the path his life has taken. As Jack works his way further into the heart of the nocturnal metropolis he finds his path leading to the ocean and a chance to recapture the safety he felt as a boy held in his father's arms. Will Jack follow his father into the waters of his past or will the line that tethers him to his adult life prove strong enough to hold him?
