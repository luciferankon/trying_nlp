The Club was an Australian reality television show about an Australian rules football sporting side the Hammerheads which was screened on the Seven Network in 2002 for one series. The show featured a handpicked team of amateur footballers coached by former VFL/AFL legend David Rhys-Jones which played against various Victorian football sides from the Western Region Football League second division following the trials and tribulations of its players. Unlike normal clubs the home audience were able to influence who was selected in the team each week by voting to keep their favorite players in the side. Viewers also got to vote on many of the club's other key aspects including its name coach captain and song.
