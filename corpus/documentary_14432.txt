Every November an interfaith retreat is held at the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps in Poland where more than 1 million people nearly all of them European Jews were exterminated by the Nazis. Why would someone participate in such a retreat? How could anyone attempt to pray or meditate in such a place? In Spite of Darkness tells the story of five retreatants among them a Rabbi an atheist and a Catholic priest-and how they come face to face not only with their own vulnerabilities and complicity but with new strength peace and glimmers of hope.
