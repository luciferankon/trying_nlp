Young Queer New York is a documentary film that showcases the lives and thoughts of eight young queer people in New York City. Through intimate interviews these eight voices reveal both the joys and woes of being out in the "queer capital of the world." From ideal queer beauty and bisexual fetishizing to gay sex apps and the intersectionality of race and sexuality each interview opens up a discussion about queer issues that goes beyond same-sex marriage and pushes for a closer examination of "equality." As these issues become clear and consistent amongst multiple voices the film acts as a critique of the notion that New York City is a queer haven and that everything is "getting better."
