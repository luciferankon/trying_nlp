On the 9th of July 2014 one billion people around the world were preparing to watch the World Cup Brazil semifinal between Holland and Argentina. This semifinals was generating high expectations after the other semifinal between Brazil and Germany ended the day before with the shocking score of 1 to 7. In the Gaza strip several coffee shops located on the beach were preparing for the game. Near Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza strip a group of young friends decided to meet up at the "Fun time beach" coffee shop. At the same time in other parts of the world waiting for the football match breakfasts lunches and dinners were arranged by families friends individuals according to their location and latitude. At 9 pm in Gaza strip the atmosphere was tense because Israeli airplanes and ships had started to bomb Gaza the day before. At 11 pm the match started. "It is just the beginning and the best is yet to come". This was somebody's comment at the "Fun time beach" coffee shop as in many other places around the world. At the 15th minute of the game people on the beach perceived a hiss covering the voice of the match commentator. The thunderous noise of several tons of explosives coming from the sky to the ground created panic and terror. Nine of the twelve people at the "Fun time beach" coffee shop died. The other three were seriously injured. One billion people were watching the football match. One billion people minus twelve. This is the difference.
