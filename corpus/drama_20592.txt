In September 1944 an unusual train travels to the Turkish border. Abroad the train are German fascists and Bulgarian King's officers who carry important papers and archives. A group of partisan chases the fugitives with a track. Soon airplanes with red stars on their wings could be seen in the sky. The planes are reinforcements from the Soviet aviation squadron. With its help the partisans capture the fugitives.
