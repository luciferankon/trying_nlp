'After Auschwitz' is a documentary reiterating the importance of holocaust education within society today. As our contributors maintain the world has not learned from the events of the past and still we see acts of discrimination segregation and violence towards certain communities. Touching upon contemporary issues such as the Rise of the Golden Dawn in Greece the mistreatment of Roma within Europe and anti-Semitism in modern Hungary the documentary highlights the extremities to which humanity can go - a place we must never go again. The documentary attempts to warn of what can happen and reflects upon events today that show that discrimination still happens. It is important for this reason - be us children adults politicians teachers or film-makers - that we learn about the events of the holocaust and continue to pass on these lessons for generations to come.
