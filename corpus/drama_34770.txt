A Soviet journalist receives an order - to go to a provincial town and write an article about a "leader of communist labor". Soon it turns out that this guy is not just a 'leader of communist labor' but an ordinary crook. Hard dilemma for a Soviet reporter - he MUST write about how good and wonderful this guy is. Otherwise he has problems with his editor in chief and local communist administration.
