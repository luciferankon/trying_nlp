Three humanitarian aid workers set across the Balkan Route from Turkey to Brussels in an attempt raise awareness about the plight of migrants that make their way to Western Europe. Along their journey they establish "Routes Festivals" cultural integration festivals bringing together migrant populations and local communities through dance workshops and music programs. Through their journey they highlight the different responses in Europe and offer a unique window into the integration process that migrants go through once resettled.
