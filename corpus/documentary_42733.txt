This documentary looks into the mini world of membracidae insects also known as Treehoppers living in Amazonia. A team of bug scientists take a look at these little creatures many smaller than 6 mm to reveal the complex relationships between these species and their environments. These tiny evolutionary marvels have existed for approximately 40 million years and continue to survive by mimicking the ecosystem around them. Taking on forms well beyond our imagination and looking like something from a science fiction world the treehoppers are captured through the camera's lens and through special audio recording revealing a few unexplained mysteries of nature.
