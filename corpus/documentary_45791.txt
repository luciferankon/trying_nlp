Red TailReborn 2 picks up where its predecessor "Red Tail Reborn" left off with the reconstruction of the partially destroyed P-51 Mustang named "Tuskegee Airmen." It detail the efforts and sacrifices of a small group of aircraft restorers to tell the story of forgotten American veterans the Tuskegee Airmen using this antique plane. A group inspired by the perseverance of those veterans' acts some 60 years ago. Just as the aircraft begins to take shape tragedy strikes when head restorer Gerry Beck is killed in an accident. Now as the restoration team recovers from another lost friend their pilot Brad Lang prepares to be a pilot of the rebuilt Mustang. A journey to be compared to the trailblazers he's hoping to honor.
