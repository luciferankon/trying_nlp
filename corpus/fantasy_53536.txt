Dance with us through the past the present and promises of the future. A tale of reincarnation remembrance and divine love. It's September 2047. Pope Juan Diego is sharing a story with three friends. It is a tale of a young priest from India who in 1957 was sent to Jerusalem on holy pilgrimage. A gentle mystical soul Father Giri kept a diary filled with paintings and writings and prophecies claiming they came directly from the lips of the Holy Mother. He calls them 'words that whisper in the winds.' Shortly after his return to India Father Giri passes away. His diary is immediately sent to the Vatican and handed to Pope John 23. After reading it he secretly declares that only the reigning Pontiff will have the privilege to ponder these divine mysteries. Pope Juan Diego breaks that 90-year-old tradition by telling his three friends Anthony Eduardo and Boo Father Giri's prophecy of twelve individuals who in 1987 lived on the island city of Key West. From different backgrounds and spiritual paths the Twelve in pure devotion knowingly succumb to a dreaded disease with the promise from the Divine Mother that in a future lifetime they will be reunited in Jerusalem the city of her birth. According to the diary this reunion is to take place in less than two weeks - on the October full moon celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles. And if Father Giri's prophecy proves true and the Twelve meet in Jerusalem Pope Juan Diego will be the only witness to this remarkable event.
