In any adult life there are "stories"; experiences we've had that defined who we are set us on a certain path and sometimes caused us to think about who we are and why we do or say the things we do. These revelations are part of a growing process. Everything we go through (especially in relationships) reveals a valuable lesson. We can choose to keep these lessons to ourselves. After all not everything is for everybody. However sharing parts of what we discover can be a comfort and a therapeutic exercise that serves to broaden our outlook and that of others. There is no greater sense of relief and comfort than to realize somewhere there is someone who has not only gone through what we experience but they are willing to openly discuss the "good" that can come from every situation (The main message in the book "Life Is Not Complicated You Are")
