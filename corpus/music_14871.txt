Fairport Convention: Folk Heroes tells the story of how in the late 1960s a group of North London musicians shook traditional English folk music to its roots by fusing it with rock - simultaneously outraging the purists and delighting a new and devoted audience. Through newly filmed interviews with the band including Richard Thompson Fairport Convention: Folk Heroes uncovers how the group survived tragedy when their drummer was killed in a car crash early-on in their career followed by the tragic death of lead vocalist Sandy Denny and how they overcame numerous line-up changes to continually reinvent themselves by discovering and recruiting some of the finest virtuosos in the country.
