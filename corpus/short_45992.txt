Animated film explains the theory that Earth's land areas are fluid and that in the process of a slow rolling boiling motion one part of the Earth might well be engulfed and then rise again some distance away much the same as froth on a kettle of soup. From this theory comes the idea that continents were formed from one super-continent that broke up whose pieces sank and then rose once more but far apart. Introducing the film is Professor J.
