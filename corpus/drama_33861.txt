Panicked pianist and crooner Sam Johnson finds himself in a Chicago hotel with his emotionally hungry crazed fashion model daughter Julie who just learned it was all lie. Trapped between the righteous cops and a malicious Mob family Sam and Julie have become desperate pawns. It begins one day in 1973 when aspiring speakeasy pianist and new father Sam Johnson has a chance encounter with high-school chum Donnie Turcotte: recently released prisoner and mob soldier who makes Sam an offer he can't refuse. In return for the chance to be discovered Sam becomes a conduit willingly passing along information to the Montreal family but when he becomes an accessory to an attempted murder - the cops take notice. Meanwhile Julie now a stunning young woman is recruited into the ridiculously demanding world of NYC fashion and subsequently develops a life-threatening substance abuse problem and inadvertently falls into the clutches of the New York mob with ties to her father.
