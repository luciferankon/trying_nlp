Now come into his full knowledge and power the Anti-Christ in the body of Damien Thorne is about to strike his final blow. The Christ-child has been born again on the Angel Isle Great Britain (Scotland England & Wales). The plan is simple kill the Christ child to prevent him from growing up to bring the return of Christ and death of the Anti-Christ. Damien the anti-Christ is a thirty-something CEO of a huge multinational corporation and the new ambassador for Great Britain (Scotland England & Wales) but he lusts for control of the world. The Dark One's only enemies are seven monks sworn to Damien's destruction with sacred daggers forged for that one purpose. As the monks hunt Damien he orders the systematic elimination of recently born boys one of who he believes is the Second Coming of Christ reborn. Will good or evil triumph?
