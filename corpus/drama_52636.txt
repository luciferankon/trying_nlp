The action takes place in Sofia in a summer during the WW II. Children Kalin and Gundi sneak into a yard where they meet Svetla and Sami a small Jewish boy. The four plays together. Kalin's most cherished dream is to enroll in a high school. The boy is ready to take any job to get the money he needs to buy a school uniform. Kalin's father signs on for a job at the same factory where Svetla's father is canvassing for a strike. Kalin's father shuns the strike fearing that if involved he may do harm to his son. The kids know nothing of their parents' specific activities. When the police arrive to search Svetla's home they manage to hide a suitcase full of leaflets and radio transmitter. Kalin gives up the high-school idea and urges his father to join the strike. The workers go on strike and Svetla's father is arrested. The summer holiday is over. Kalin and Gundi will start work at a furniture factory. Svetla will leave with her mother and Sami will return home lonely once again.
