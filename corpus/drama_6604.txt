A young Englishman Paul after an intensely intimate encounter in London with a beautiful but mysterious Hong Kong business woman decides to chase a whim and follow his heart to the other side of the world to pursue his love further. Armed with nothing more than a lipstick-marked business card and very little money Paul arrives in Hong Kong ready to trek across the former British colony where East meets West in search of the truth- of what really happened between him and his love that night and of what the future will hold for them both. Throughout his ordeals Paul must bear a terrible secret. But the gripping final showdown between Paul and his lover reveals Paul isn't the only one with a deep dark secret.
