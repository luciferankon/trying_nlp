The Berlin Bride is a near-silent dreamlike tale inspired by the silent film era and the darker writings of Edgar Allan Poe and E.T.A Hoffmann. Two oddball Berliners discover individually the abandoned appendages of a department store mannequin. Separately and with grotesque consequence the men come to terms with their disjointed mate. A cautionary tale of unrequited sexuality and blurring gender identity. A vision of sexual evolution and misguided passion.
