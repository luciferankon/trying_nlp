The short film depicts the contemporary human condition in an experimental surreal and exciting way in which machines and humans are treated by companies as mere work tools where an ordinary man lives his everyday life in such an automatic way that he begins to suffer bizarre changes due to this lifestyle without even noticing that. But also sees the possibility of reconstruction of this man through personal interrelation.
