FOOTBALL REVOLUTION is a documentary about 5 teenagers coming from different cultural backgrounds joining forces to win a prestigious indoor competition and change youth football in England. In the background of this simple story we witness through real action and interviews the incredible transformation of UK grassroots football from the early 90's to the Facebook age and the upraising of Futsal.
