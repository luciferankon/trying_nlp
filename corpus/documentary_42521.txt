Following the break up of the Soviet union a gang of children from broken homes made a new life together inside the derelict buildings of a once secret weapons manufacturing city. In their childhood innocence they thought they were living a fairy tale dream of freedom but with starvation and sub zero temperatures crippling their health reality soon hit home. Despite their efforts to care for one another three members of their group died. For the survivors: they must try against hopeless odds to turn their lives around.
