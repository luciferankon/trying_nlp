The third in a series of clamorous comedies about the everyday tribulations of the inhabitants of the Southern Bohemian town of Kamenákov. A Romany family moves into police chief Pepa's ('Václav Vydra (III)' (qv)) neighborhood. Leo Khon ('Josef Laufer (I)' (qv)) the richest man in Kamenákov owns a soccer team made up of friends and acquaintances. They play miserably however managing to lose to the worst of all teams the Boulders of Little Rock. Khon's mother-in-law refuses to ignore such a waste of family funds and bets her son-in-law that she who knows absolutely nothing about soccer can put together a team which will pulverize his freeloaders. And why not since Romany boys are virtually born with soccer shoes on? The stakes are high and each team is promised a special reward for winning.
