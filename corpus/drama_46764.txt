After more than two decades working for Tunisia national public radio Youssef is on his way to retirement. Somewhere in the town of Sidi Bouzid a young man sets himself on fire. Youssef is viciously cut off broadcasting during the last issue of "Tunis by night". As he leaves the radio station he gets picked up by a police patrol car waiting for him and he spends a few hours in police custody. Amal (his wife) finds refuge again in prayer and the elder brother Amin tries to put his family's pieces back together as well as he can. Their youngest daughter Aziza lives completely disconnected from the pace and values of her family. She cuts her veins after a cascade of problems. Revolted but silent Youssef takes refuge at the "Saint George" the adjacent bar he has been a patron forever. He empties his mind after emptying a few bottles of wine. Youssef then runs away from his family to be engulfed by a city he does not recognize anymore.
