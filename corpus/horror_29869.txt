In Fly Creek a storm knocks down the power lines transforming worms in mutant creatures. Mick travels from New York to meet his girlfriend Geri Sanders and stays at her home with her mother Naomi Sanders and her sister Alma Sanders. On the arrival Mick has a friction with Sheriff Jim Reston and with Geri's neighbor Roger Grimes that woos her. Soon they find that Fly Creek is infested of carnivorous worms that are devouring the inhabitants but Sheriff Reston believes it is a prank of Mick. At the beginning of the film we learn from one of the characters that earthworms can be called to the surface with electricity but somehow it turns them into vicious flesh-eaters. Sure enough a storm that night causes some power lines to break and touch the ground drawing millions of man-eating worms out of the earth and into town where they quickly start munching on the locals. Slightly tongue-in-cheek horror film about carnivorous worms brought to the surface by a fallen electrical wire that sends millions of volts of electricity into the ground near the vicinity of a sleepy fishing village in the US state of Georgia.
