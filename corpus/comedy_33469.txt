A calamity at Dante and Randall's shops sends them looking for new horizons - but they ultimately settle at Mooby's a fictional fast-food restaurant. Free from his dead-end job (and lodged in a new one) Dante begins to break free of his rut planning to move away with his clingy fiancé. Dante is ready to leave the horrors of minimum-wage New Jersey behind but Randal - always the more hostile of the two - starts to become overwhelmed by his own rancor. Ten years later Dante Hicks heads to work at the Quick Stop only to discover it is burnt down. The calamity forces him and his friend Randal Graves to seek employment at the fast-food joint Mooby's. A year later Dante is on the verge of leaving New Jersey and moving to Florida with his fiancée Emma and leave his dead-end minimum wage lifestyle. This leaves Randal feeling rejected and betrayed. However as the day progresses Dante starts questioning whether it is worth moving down to Florida after all. In New Jersey when Dante arrives to open the convenience store "Quick Stop Groceries" for another labor day he finds the place on fire. Dante and his friend Randal find another job at the fast food restaurant Mooby's managed by Becky and work with the Christian employee Elias. Drug dealers Jay and Silent Bob also move their traffic spot to this new location. Dante is planning a new life in Florida getting married with his fiancée Emma while his friend Becky is a woman that does not believe in romantic love. On the eve of Dante's departure to Florida Randal decides to throw a farewell/bachelor party for his best friend. However things go wrong and Dante rethinks his future.
