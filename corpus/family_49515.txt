Normally Cancerians are very innocent and humble yet they unknowingly create lot of humor. Once upon a time Shashikant had got married and his stipulated 8 days of leave was over. He requests for an extension of 4 days. His boss asks in frustration "What now?". His reply to his boss was "My wife is planning to go to Mahabaleshwar for honeymoon and wants me to accompany her". It is full of funny situations and quirk.
