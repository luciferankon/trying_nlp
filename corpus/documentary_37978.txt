Boxed in sets of five and staring out with sugar-blackened eyes Marshmallow Peeps have been emerging like clockwork from a factory in Bethlehem Pennsylvania since the 1950s.

It's the story of how a sweet candy product got to the shelves of your convenience store--and what happened after it left them behind.
