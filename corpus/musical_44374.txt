Direct from London's glittering West End our favorite multi-award winning international cabaret sensation Meow Meow (Vamp) returns to Sydney Festival with a perfectly wild take on Hans Christian Andersen's bittersweet fable. With Malthouse Theatre director Marion Potts composer Iain Grandage (Optimism) the Wild Dog Orchestra and the ever-dexterous Mitchell Butel (Woyzeck) Meow and her cohorts ignite a fantastical flight of musical fancy with dark cut throat comedy and a whiplash score.
