Neely tries to make sense of the situation only to find he is the only one in town who doesn't know. Neely's Wife Nora however has a worldly warm charm that gently steers him through the trials and tribulations of raising their two sons. Neely connects more with Cain being a footballer athlete and sports fan while he struggles to find common ground with Able. Nora the anchor of the family insists Neely gives Able a chance. Able has a visit from four beautiful girls and Neely's curiosity gets the better of him even against Nora's explicit instructions. As usual Neely ends up the worse for wear.
