Robberies don't always have to be planned. In this case they dont even have to make sense. Follow Micky as he attempts to hold up the wrong shop at the wrong time and in the wrong neighbourhood. 'Nuts and Robbers' is a black-comedy short film from the creative minds of Marty Stalker and Aidan Gault.
