The reticence of Martha Sellers and her employment of Jim Ransom a drunkard excites the curiosity of the villagers. She receives mail postmarked "Ossining" and this further stirs the people. The gossipers spread the report that her lover is in Sing Sing but the heart of the matter is that her husband has been unjustly convicted on a charge of embezzlement. Fate takes a hand and Ranson asserts that he is responsible for the robbery thereby reuniting Martha and her husband.
