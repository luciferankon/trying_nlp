See East End Icons the Cockney Rejects cannon into the West End and deliver a blistering "Oi Oi Oi" to capacity crowd for one glorious night in the long hot summer of 2007. Watch as the Street Punk legends Ozzy Osborne called "men after my own heart" raise the roof and blow the crowd away. Head down and hold tight. The boys are back in town. "The sound of the Rejects is the ringing hum of human energy" - Morrissey.
