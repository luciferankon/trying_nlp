Llar the home a space where the fireplace lights up to warm the house. But also Llar in its most metaphorical and spiritual sense. We talk about home when we lose it when we observe it from far when we feel the necessity of returning to it almost always frustrated by space or time. Two opposed directors different experiences generations and formal propositions and yet somehow the images to both suggested by the Asturian term Llar embrace and complement each other bringing us a tale of uprooting and solitude a requiem for the end of a society a way of understanding life the passage of time and the relationship with nature.
