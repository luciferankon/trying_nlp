A 60-minute salute to American International Pictures. Entertainment lawyer Samuel Z. Arkoff founded AIP (then called American Releasing Corporation) on a $3000 loan in 1954 with his partner James H. Nicholson a former West Coast exhibitor and distributor.

From monsters to beach parties to cycle gangs to the psychedelic youth many film clips are shown highlighting the company's successful twenty-five year run in Hollywood.
