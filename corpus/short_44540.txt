The concept of 'Monthly Dosage' (Created by Demitri Vassiliadis) was based on the idea of conceptualising producing and shooting film with little to no budget planning or resource. Using dark absurd and socio-political driven satirical ideas from our team and close friends we embarked on creating 10 unique and guerrilla inspired projects. This series of shorts was filmed over 2 months in the Summer of 2014 and on a wide but limited budget ranging from Ł0-Ł50. Using whatever resources we had whether it be people equipment or location we would take the ideas generated and simply go out and film it. Why? I hear you ask....Because we love it...do we need any other explanation?
