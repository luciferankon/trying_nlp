He forgets entirely about school and goes forth to the drawing. The scene of the contest is now in view the horde of competitors old and young clamoring for admittance. They are finally allowed in and each takes a ballot bearing a number from a table. They pass into another room and when they are seated the director of the lottery begins to turn the charge wheel upon which are numbers. The roulette stops at a number and to everybody's surprise the winner proves to be the little boy. The prize promptly comes toward him and carries him off under her arm into a carriage 'mid the cheers of the crowd.
