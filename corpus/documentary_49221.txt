Paradoxically enough there is probably no way to have a deep understanding of a culture that is not ours when immersed in it on a daily basis. Every single year of the six I have now spent in Thailand makes the process of acculturation even more confusing. The footage of Buffalos Fire & TV has not been made with the idea of this film in mind there was just a magnetic thing going on at the time of the shooting. It is only later that these three shots started to entangle with the political events of this country the way Thai people see life and my understanding of things.
