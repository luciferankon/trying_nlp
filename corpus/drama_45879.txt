Peering in the window famous country singer Trey Cole is finally returning home after cruelly abandoning the town many years ago and never looking back even when his brother died serving in the military. Now realizing he's lost himself along the way Trey remembers getting his first haircut in the cracked brown leather chair in Charlie's shop and hopes to find guidance from the man who was a father to him when his own dad General Wes Cameron was coldly absent during his childhood. However as Trey enters the shop and sees Charlie's old friends playing a trio of instruments in the back room he is surprised when Charlie isn't there and is saddened to hear of his death just a few months prior.
