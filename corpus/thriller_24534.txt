After the tragic death of Dr. Henry Jekyll his illegitimate half brother Dr. Edgar Brodie inherits the family fortune . . . and misfortune as well. Masque is a classic Victorian morality tale that draws from the writings of Robert Louis Stevenson to craft a new and powerful parallel story. It is built from the same historical influences that Stevenson used to create his original "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. It also returns us to Stevenson's home town of Edinburgh Scotland which was a character with a split personality in itself. This story takes an unflinching look at the complexities of the human soul and what drives us to choose good or to succumb to our inner darkness. It is indeed as Shakespeare said - "a player that struts and frets its appointed hour" but it can hardly be said to "signify nothing."
