IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE... Tom and Sheila Stanford purchase a locker intending to donate the clothes to charity. What they don't know is there is Cartel cash hidden among the boxes...and they want it back. But the Cartel may have bitten off more than it can chew. You see the Stanfords are Marines and Marines aren't trained to give up. When Tom and Sheila Stanford buy Storage Locker #38 they think they're getting a few dozen boxes of misprinted T-shirts. Not worth much money but perfect for the orphan kids down in Mexico. The Stanfords have no idea that their newly-purchased storage unit is a clandestine staging area for a Mexican drug family. They know nothing about the 640 million dollars of drug money hidden under all those T-shirts. Now Tom and Sheila are running for their lives fighting to stay ahead of the murderous Canton Cartel. The assassins on their trail are utterly ruthless. For them kidnapping torture and murder are all part of the job. But this time they're not up against ordinary cops or civilians. Tom and Sheila Stanford are both retired from the United States Marine Corps and Marines are hard to kill.
