Sign Posts of Dr. Roy Walford chronicles the life of an eccentric artist-philosopher and award-winning research scientist in the field of gerontology with a specialty in calorie restriction. Walford was a Renaissance man in the truest sense of the word. This documentary features his obsession with life death poetry politics theater women and radicalism. His research at the University of California in Los Angeles spanned forty years and won him the highest respect from 'his peers. But it was his thirst for life adventure and freedom that sent him to live in India for a year to travel alongside the Living Theater to create music videos and to embark on the maiden two-year voyage inside the hermetically sealed Biosphere 2 in 1991. Cut short on his quest for immortality by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis otherwise known as Lou Gehrig's disease Walford died in 2004. "Every life is an emergency" his journals remind us. This story is about a man with a vision a man who broke social boundaries a man who dared to live it all.
