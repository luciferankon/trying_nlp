Opal Whiteley transformed from a child of rural Oregon who sang to her earthworm friends to a dazzling enchantress of French royalty. She gained worldwide fame for her whimsical childhood diary and then disappeared to India where she lived as the guest of a maharajah. Years later the world again found Opal this time living in the gutters of London. She was committed to a mental institution where she stayed for the remainder of her life. Along this tumultuous journey Opal won the hearts of millions of people because of her refreshingly innocent diaries that captured a child-like sense of wonder gone from society after World War I.
