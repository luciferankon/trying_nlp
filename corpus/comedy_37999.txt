Johnny Star's fans have always adored him and know full well why he's the undisputed "King of White Soul." Johnny was adopted by an African-American family and raised with love by Mamma Starr a non-nonsense black woman with the iron fist and a heart of gold. Johnny had a gigantic recording career a stack of gold records and a touring bus that was infamous for.. .well everything. Johnny's career has slowed down somewhat and he has the time to travel to Las Vegas with Mamma and his wisecracking sister Brenda to hear the reading of his birth father's will. It turns out Johnny's father has left him his church. The church was a front for gambling and tax breaks and Johnny has no intention of trading in his guitar and snakeskin pants for a robe and pulpit. But Mamma convinces Johnny that his tour bus has been on the road long enough. Maybe this is a place he needs to stay a while. Johnny's going to give preaching the word of God a try. If anyone knows about evil and temptation it would be a veteran rock star like Johnny. It might do Johnny some good. It ought to do Tiny Johnny's stepbrother fresh out of prison a lot of good. And it might be nice to give up the road for a while and stay with his family in a new place - a place where everyone knows Johnny as "The Rev."
