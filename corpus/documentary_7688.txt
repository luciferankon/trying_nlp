In this program Adrian Gilbert delves deeper than ever in order to penetrate the mystery of medieval alchemy. Going beyond psychology he explores how the alchemists used diagrams and traditional nomenclatures to discuss ideas that had they been expressed openly at the time would have invited persecution and maybe even burning at the stake. These ideas of self-transformation throw light on the work of such influential modern teachers as G.I. Gurdjieff and P.D. Ouspensky. Alchemy it turns out is the missing fragment of their "unknown teaching." Featuring renowned author and researcher Adrian Gilbert in this ongoing series of Occult and Esoteric Knowledge.
