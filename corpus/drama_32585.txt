In 1982 Aston Villa won the European Cup beating the mighty Bayern Munich 1-0 (against all the odds). The Trophy was taken around various pubs by the players to show the fans. At one pub - The Fox at Tamworth it got stolen "Nicked!" and this film is the scarcely believable events of the next 24 hours trying to recover the trophy before the Aston Villa Directors and the fans  knew it had gone walkies. The Cup found its way to Sheffield where after various hilarious - mainly true events - it was played for by a group of football mad coppers in the Police Station garage. Of course that is only part of the story. How it got to Sheffield in the first placehow it got damaged who took it and why are at the center of this comedy drama.
