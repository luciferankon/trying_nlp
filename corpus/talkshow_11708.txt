We first spotted Parker AKA Dumbfoundead when we saw him kick-butt Tae Kwon Do-style and freestyle in a viral YouTube video from 2009. We were scared of him but when we found out he and Awkwafina were friends we saw the green lights and went for it. We invited him onto her show and boy were these two cut from the same camo. All hail Dumbfoundead he's the real thing.
