The Muse features a mask prominently in the sequence. Masks have been used for thousands of years both as ritual objects and important tools for artists and actors since the earliest Greek chorus plays. There's an innate magic to the mask: an object that is lifeless and inert yet when worn on a human body it acquires a sudden animation that can be compelling even eerie. So the symbolism of Jasmine ('The Muse') handing the mask to Dawn at a critical moment is a metaphor for both the artist's license to create and her tool for doing so.
