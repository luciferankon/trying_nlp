An engaging film portrait of artist Antonio Frasconi which captures the wide range of his work -from impressionistic landscapes to compelling images of war. *** Pablo Frasconi in this intimate film of Antonio Frasconi the master of graphics matches his father's well-known sensitivity and boldness. It is an almost magical delight to watch their two media collaborating on the emergence of a woodcut print from its raw materials to its finished achievement. --Jay Leyda Professor of Cinema Studies NYU
