Last travel around the world with poet Tomaz Pengov .The road - the shelter of restless mendisappearing and sliding through footsteps as it leaves us behindand gives birth to deafening horizons.The timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness. And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.
