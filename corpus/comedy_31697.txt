An experienced Harlem con man with his wife as his partner have engaged in numerous confidence games throughout their criminal careers but this time he thinks he has come across a game that can't miss..."Preaching". Blessed with oratory skills he disguises himself as a Preacher and embarks on a mission to create a television show and build a church that will "serve the lord and his disciples" (ie. fill his pockets). But the plot thickens as women flock to help build this church; it seems that lust and greed are two sins he can't avoid! Soon this "Fake Preacher" has gotten himself into a life and death situation. Lord save his soul!
