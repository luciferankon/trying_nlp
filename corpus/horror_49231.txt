In 1877 a fierce creature known as Bovinus Spiritualis (the Black Hodag) was discovered in the northern woods of Oneida County Wisconsin. To this day locals whisper of the Black Forest and the curse of the creature that dwells within. "Backwoods Bloodbath" is an old school horror-gore flick about six friends who take a road trip to a back country town where a local legend has been feeding off the population for decades only to find themselves becoming the latest items on the creature's menu.
