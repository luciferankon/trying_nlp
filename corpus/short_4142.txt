Potluck is a collection of three short films which examine the tragic comedic and haphazard situations and decisions that we all must face from day to day. These glimpses into 'ordinary' circumstances serve as a heart-felt illustration about the nature of life which is inevitably a mixture of the bitter sour salty and sweet. 'Bad Day' ~~ Toby (Cameron Cox) is having a bad day; a very very bad day! In this modern rehashing of the story of Job one man must come to terms with the horrible conditions of his life. Sometimes funny and sometimes somber this film addresses existential issues of meaning and purpose that every person must grapple with eventually. 'Success Story Part I' ~~ Kevin (Jason Matthew Smith "Sons of Anarchy" "Star Trek") is an actor whose agent Laura (Osa Winter) has landed him a break-through role. But Kevin will not accept the role because of an issue in the script which would cause him to violate his personal faith and code of ethics. Laura attempts to persuade him that he is blowing the matter out of proportion and that he should not pass up such an incredible opportunity. This film raises serious questions about the value of morality and the cost of accomplishment. 'He-Man Woman Hater's Club' ~~ A young man (Ryan Christopher Keys) and woman (Jaimie Hunter) discover an instant romantic connection with each other right before they step into adjacent conference rooms. There they find themselves in the midst of an angry mob of same-sex attendees who have gathered together to verbally bash the opposite sex. This short deals humorously with the misunderstandings quirks and innate differences that plague male-female relationships while ultimately highlighting our need for one another.
