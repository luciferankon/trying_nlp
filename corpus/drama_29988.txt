A newlywed couple would love a child. At least the man wants one. When his wife Xia is still not pregnant after a year Dong blames her. After medical tests it becomes apparent that there's nothing wrong with Xia. Dong has his doubts about his own fertility and starts using stimuli so he can do it more often and in this way improve the chances of getting a child. Xia thinks of a solution: she'll get pregnant by someone else. When Dong then finds out that he is infertile there's hell to pay.
