This extraordinary war film will be a major event as the stories of the courageous nurses stationed in Bataan Corregidor arenas were willing to sacrifice their own lives for their "boys"/soldiers. Even fighting to survive and care for them and each other in underground tunnels. A beautiful opportunity for top women in film.
