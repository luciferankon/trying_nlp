It is a lovely autumn day and Leslie has taken her daughter Brooke out for a driving lesson on a quiet country road. Unfortunately Leslie is a psychologist unable to pry herself away from her cell phone and the needy patients on the other end and Brooke is a teenager unable to pry herself away from her own adolescent exasperation. Typical mother daughter friction until Brooke hits a small animal Leslie's patient begins talking suicide and silence is broken on the quiet country road when an elderly couple come barreling along in their Station Wagon.
