A Season to Remember follows Billy through a season as the title reflects but it is much more than this. The "Season" we refer to pertains to our seasons of life and the changes we go through and the gains and losses we endure. As Billy returns to the woods and places where he shared these sacred times with his father we are brought closer to him and his remembrance of his Dad and we are given the rare opportunity to see a glimpse into the life of a wonderful father and teacher.
