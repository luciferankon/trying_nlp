It is 2002. The lead singer of the Gereformeerde Blues Band Johannes Kerkorrel just committed suicide. A group of friends gather to celebrate his life and the passing of an era. Through flashbacks and voice overs we re-live the rise of the VoÃ«lvry movement and the rebellion of young Afrikaans students in the build-up to the fall of the National Party. We share in the friends' confusion of being young and finding their place in the world.
