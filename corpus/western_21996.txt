Grant hides stolen money in the luggage of Bonnie Shea who is moving west. Later when he and his men arrive to retrieve the money they also kidnap Bonnie. This sends Reasonin' Bates and his cowhands on their horses after the gangsters in their cars. Bonnie Shea ('Mary Doran (I)' (qv)) arrives to take ownership of the Sunset Ranch in Arizona unaware that one of her trunks contains the ransom money from a kidnapping pulled off by a gang headed by Grant (Walter McGrail'). Eddie (James Eagles') her brother who purchased the ranch for her is involved with the gang. She arrives in Arizona only to find that the ranch hands at first resent her presence as the new owner especially Reasonin' Bates ('Hoot Gibson' (qv)) and foreman Dan Caswell ('John Elliott (I)' (qv)) who had hoped to purchase the ranch for themselves. Bates' resentment of the girl eventually fades especially after the arrival of the Grant gang in search of the ransom money which Bonnie still doesn't know she has.
