Come as You Are is a stylised and colourful exploration of three individuals who have created an alter ego which offers an outlet from their normal daily lives. Each is a separate journey into the terrain of sexuality identity and fantasy within the urban landscape. A drag queen a sexual outlaw and an urban cowboy reveal what lies behind the 'mask'.
