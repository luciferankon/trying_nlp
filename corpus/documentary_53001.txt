The Bavarian Al Capone is the autobiographical portrait of Theo Berger. a man who spent most of his lifetime behind bars. His records of criminal exploits as house- and jail-breaker register more than 150 criminal offenses committed since turning eighteen. Theo Berger was sentenced to some 30 years in prison terms twice superseded by by stints of preventive detention. Footage was shot during the half year parole Theo Berger received once prison doctors arrived at his medical verdict: leukemia. Soon after the participation in this film Theo Berger - not yet prepared for freedom - robbed a bank got arrested and was sentenced to another 12 years. A telling tale on guilt and expiation describing the justice system in Germany at the end of the 20th century.
