RIVER ROAD is the story of two Yugur ethnic minority brothers Bartel and Adikeer. They set out on a journey across the prairies of northwestern China in search of their parents skillfully maneuvering their camels over the vast expanse of dry ground. The allure of the film's core components - the great outdoors children and animals - instantly catch our attention. Though realistic the boys' journey powered by dreams and anxiety is depicted with a touch of fantasy. And to firmly establish his characters director Li Ruijun imbues this impressive effort - a coming-of-age drama couched in the guise of an adventure - with a winning sense of humor rooted in careful attention to detail. At the heart of the film however is a mournful air bemoaning the disappearance of ethnic minorities and the destruction of nature. As suggested by its epic scale the work has the classic qualities of a film that allows us to enjoy being emotionally affected emotional by what we see.
