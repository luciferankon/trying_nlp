This is partly because he is unlucky in love and partly because he sometimes acts in a clumsy or thick-headed manner that gets him into trouble.

Then one day his world turns upside down with the appearance of Nagisa Shiozaki a pretty brunette kindergarten teacher who agrees to go on a date with him. It's love at first sight for Masuo but whenever he tries to make serious progress his bad luck kicks in and leaves him in situations that Nagisa easily misconstrues. That's not the only problem: Nagisa while she likes Masuo constantly pushes him away due to a previous affair which ended badly and she can't risk another affair and heartbreak. And though Masuo doesn't believe it his friend and co-worker a stunning blonde named Miho Hamaoka has fallen in love with him and constantly makes advances toward him. Between perpetual bad luck and a choice between two girls what will become of Masuo?
