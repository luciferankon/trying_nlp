A woman facing a bleak future recounts her life in sketchy seemingly random episodes. One by one the scars and despair left by a life full of burden and sacrifice but with little joy inevitably emerge. Diario del Fin (Diary of the End) is a visceral and moving account filled with brutally honest yet liberating confessions. It is permeated by a profound introspection and clarity of perception which seem to surface only in extreme point-of-no-return situations.
