Luise is kind of a chaotic woman who lives alone with her son Arthur. She's always on the edge but that's nothing compared to what happens when her sister Jeanette asks her to do her shifts as a nurse because she has severe problems with her lover she needs to take care of. Suddenly the juvenile welfare office is interested in Luise's competence as a mother and as if that were not enough Arthur runs away to find out about who his real father is. Arthur tries to hire Lucky a private-detective but gets rejected and now tries to investigate on his own. Meanwhile Luise tries to find out where Arthur has gone and the juvenile welfare office sends the police after Luise.
