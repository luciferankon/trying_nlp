On the second floor of the one hundred year old Deane House in the community of Inglewood Calgary Alberta Canada lives an energy force that defies explanation. The existence of the energy force or more accurately the "vortex" in the Deane House has been confirmed by paranormal organizations and psychics. It is responsible for at least three murders one suicide and several mysterious deaths. It also keeps the dead from crossing over and as a result the quaint neighborhood is teeming with ghosts. The vortex is connected to incredible historic incidences such as the sinking of the Titanic and the World War Two prison break known as the "Great Escape". Murderers have complained of being possessed by an evil force they had no control over. Most intriguingly the ghosts the Vortex keeps chained to Inglewood have been seen heard and photographed.
