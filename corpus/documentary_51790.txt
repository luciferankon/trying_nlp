The two main characters are both music lovers. One man quit his job in a state-owned factory to study composing and now writes more than 100 songs. The other learned piano and MIDI all by himself. His students include famous idols but he keeps charging them for free. They live a poor life but stay calm inside themselves. It's a true story in a corner of eastern China. In fact their life has nothing to do with dreams or perseverance. They are just living with love and for life itself. What's more it's 100% true.
