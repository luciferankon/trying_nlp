Almost from the day of his birth people tell Ludwig Emil Grimm he was less able than his brothers Jakob and Wilhelm. It seems like Ludwigs way of live is already predefined: He is meant to be good in school and study just like his brothers. But Ludwig is not like his brothers at all. Vocabulary exams and math-tasks only annoy him. There is only one thing he wants to do: He wants to Draw. Although his family has his back it is really hard for him to earn enough money to live on his own. Torn between dependency of his backers and the wish to earn enough money on his own Ludwig gets more and more distracted from his creative process. It allmost seemed like it was his destiny to meet the young Countess of WÃ¤chtersbach Auguste as he visits the small town his grandmother used to live in. Only through her love and the magic of the fairy tales his brothers collected he finds his way back to his art and creativity skills which were to make him one of the most influential artists of his generation.
