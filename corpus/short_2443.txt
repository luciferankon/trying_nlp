Since the Haiti disaster on the 12th of January 2010 it has not only been humanitarian organizations working in the country. Animal welfare organizations formed a coalition of veterinarians and vet technicians (ARCH) to address the needs of both the animal and human populations. The full list of contributing organizations can be seen in the end titles. This film illustrates the phenomenal work achieved so far to vaccinate and treat the surviving animal population thereby preventing deadly animal borne diseases in humans. ARCH was formed just days after the devastating quake of January 12th 2010 to provide health services to the many orphaned and surviving domestic animals. This translates to the saving of untold thousands of human lives by preventing animal borne diseases like anthrax and rabies from being transmitted to humans by their animal counterparts. A single cow infected with anthrax could kill hundreds of people. A single dog or cat infected with rabies could kill dozens. ARCH is the only charitable organization in Haiti addressing this desperate need. Their veterinarians and vet technicians are the unsung heroes of Haiti.
