Through scores of accounts collected with the help of artist/traveler Titouan Lamazou Claire Duguet tells of the violence that has been a daily part of the lives of the women in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo for nearly 20 years. Located in the heart of Africa's Great Lakes region the DRC has been the scene of a number of episodes of conflict. Millions of refugees in the country continue to live in fear for their lives. These accounts of women paint an accurate and moving picture of this sensitive part of the world. Some work for the UN transport ore and fight for peace and women's rights while others have been displaced by armed conflicts or are victims of mass sexual violence perpetrated since the Rwandan Genocide. This documentary/road movie follows the artist and painter Titouan Lamazou as he meets the Women of the African Great Lakes.
