Nothing in the world is simply black and white. Three men sit in the Dog & Duck a pub in London's Soho. It's last call. One offers to get a round and each wants a Guinness. He summarizes "So that's three Guinnesses" and that precipitates a disagreement about the stout's plural: Guinnesses Guinni (accent on the second syllable) or simply Guinness (as in one fish two fish). Each form has its proponent. Will the lads take a break from their disagreement long enough for one to get to the bar and place the order? Will fisticuffs erupt?
