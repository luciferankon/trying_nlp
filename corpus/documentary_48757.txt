Filmmaker Jack Bond and Salvador Dali got together at Christmas 1965 to make Dali in New York a highly entertaining film. Dali devoted two weeks of his life to creating extraordinary scenes for the film performing "manifestations" with a plaster cast. A thousand ants and one million dollars in cash. When he confronts the feminist writer Jane Arden sparks fly. "You are my Slave! I am not your slave. Everybody is my slave." Dali recalls his meeting with Freud "The last human relationship ever" About his wife 'But for Gala I would be lying in a gutter somewhere covered with lice" Jim Desmond's dazzling cinematography captures the great artist painting as Flamenco virtuoso Manitas de Plata performs. Dali in New York is a rare treat for anyone who loves film and the living theatre of Dali's surreal universe.
