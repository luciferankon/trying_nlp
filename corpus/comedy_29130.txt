Among the sunny valley of Los Angeles in a small cozy building complex live six friends. Friends not by choice but rather by circumstance. Friends drawn together by the ever changing flow of the California breeze. Caught up in a chaotic world of temporary trifles temporary relationships and temporary routines. Dan- the nerdy animal lover (played by Tony Evangelista) Robin- the quirky heart breaker (played by Desi Ivanova) and Sasha-the all innocent primary-school teacher (played by Svetlana Islamova). Marjory-the nosybossy building manager played by Valorie Hubbard('Resident Evil' 'How I Met Your Mother') Argo- the middle aged sleazy artist played by Anthony Montes and Jessica- the young obsessive perfectionist played by Kika Cicmanec.
