Jason is a rebellious young teenager who wants nothing to do with his family's Christian faith and doesn't care about the Bible. He is clueless as to the danger his soul is in. But upon falling asleep one night he wakes to find himself in a strange forest: a forest where the spiritual becomes physical. He finds himself being hunted by a black figure and sees himself in various forms: one named Prisoner of Fear one named Ha-tred and one named Mischief all different aspects of his character. He is then forced to make a fateful decision: serve the dark figure that hunts him or take the only escape: accept Jesus as His Savior.
