Video Village was a popular afternoon game show played on a set that was a replica of a town complete with shops a bridge a jail and three streets made up of squares bearing instructions such as 'Lose a turn'. The two contestants took turns to move around the board. The Town Crier operated an electronic console which acted as a die selecting a number between one and six. Prizes were collected along the way. The first to reach the Village Bus was the winner. The show was made in Melbourne by Crawford Productions and HSV-7 and ran from 1962 to 1966. Hosts included Danny Webb and Liz Harris.
