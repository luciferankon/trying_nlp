We wanted to know what it looks feels and sounds like at at Trump event. So we flew to Chicago from LA and then drove to Janesville Wisconsin to attend Donald Trump's speech. We also spoke to his supporters who were gathered outside the venue about what drew them to the event. This is the ultimate Trump rally experience.
