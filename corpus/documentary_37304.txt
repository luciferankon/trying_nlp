Guitar Holiday is a colorful vibrant documentary portrait of the guitar makers of Paracho Michoacan and the beautiful town that relies upon the guitar for its livelihood. Dozens of guitar shops line the main plaza and side streets of Paracho where you can buy a guitar from the person who made it. Every August Paracho comes alive as it hosts the Mexican National Guitar Festival. The festival features classical guitar concerts parades mariachi and Purepecha folk performances and competitions for guitarists and guitar makers. But ultimately it is the town that emerges as the main character in a spirited display of tradition and community pride.
