On August 23 1992 a black-ops research program led by General Roberts perfected a device to control the weather. It was launched from a specially outfitted plane and tested for the first time. But control of the machine was lost and within hours a deadly hurricane had formed. It became the greatest natural disaster since the San Francisco Earthquake - Hurricane Andrew. In the wake of this catastrophe all evidence of the program was buried. Seven years later General Roberts has revived the top-secret project. He recruits ambitious meteorologist Ron Young who has developed software that directs weather systems. The STORM device now equipped with this software has been launched into a weather front 300 miles off the California coast. Moments after the device has whipped the storm into a full-blown hurricane Roberts orders it targeted at Mexico. The storm has grown in power to a super-hurricane with wind speeds exceeding 400 miles per hour. A struggle on board the plane ensues causing the deadly hurricane to head straight for Los Angeles. Young who goes up in another C-123 has less than 3 hours to fly directly into the eye of this super hurricane and regain control of the STORM device. However there are saboteurs on board. A battle at 20000 feet above the Pacific Ocean is taking place while the city of Los Angeles awaits the coming siege.
