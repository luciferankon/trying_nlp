Malayalam-speaking Mata Amritanandamayi was born near Kochi Kerala India and is one of the most well-known saintly persons of this millennium. She makes it a point to greet and hug everyone who comes for her Darshan sometimes hugging as many as 45000 people in a 21 hour period. She also heads a Ashram that feeds the hungry and looks after the homeless apart from being involved in several housing projects in India and has displayed a special empathy for both humans and animals alike. She has also traveled to France and North America and has preached about peace and goodwill especially in these troubled times. She has also traveled extensively in India especially to Kolkata and Varanasi where she was greeted with millions of devotees. She cautions everyone that during Ramrajya Lord Ram had to travel across the seas to fight evil; then during the time of Lord Kishan evil was fought not only on the homeland but also with friends and relatives; and now in the current age evil resides within people themselves - and it is not going to be just enough to take a daily - but also cleanse oneself of evil.
