Ellen has the contract for the South West Stage Line through the panhandle. Her father had the run for years and Haney who runs the office worked for him. But Ellen does not know that Haney is in league with Elkins and they want the stage line so they can rob the gold shipments. All they need do is stop the stage and end her contract but that is not easy with Dave driving for Ellen.
