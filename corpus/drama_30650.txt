Bilal a Muslim high school senior works at his family's long-owned taxi stand. "The Stand" as they call it has been the source of all activity and money for the family for the last sixty years. It seems like BÃ­lal is about to carry the torch. He secretly submits a college application and takes up the art of ice carving in order to win a scholarship. However he is forced to decide whether he will continue working at the Stand - the only life he's ever known - or take a chance at social mobility.
