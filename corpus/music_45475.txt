LITTLE-BIG is a music film which blends glittery pop-folk and heavy metal the gypsy wedding orchestra and the underground scene. This jolly and colorful mixture is spiced up by the conversation between the members of a defunct 1990's thrash metal band. The former band mates talk about their unfulfilled dreams their unfinished battles and unresolved inner complexes. What is the life of a musician what is the price we all have to pay for the choices we make? Is it hard to believe in oneself and pursue one's dreams? Albeit a music film LITTLE-BIG is concerned with art in general an abstract and seemingly easily accessible space in which the unprepared ones may lose everything while those who have made sufficient efforts may be able to transform it into a very personal sacred territory. A group of young and enthusiastic musicians does not have the strength to continue and falls apart. Is it because of the chalga which has progressed from cheap entertainment to a cultural value or because of young generation artists' laziness and lack of initiative?
