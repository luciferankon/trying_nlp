Wide Sargasso Sea is an attempt to catch the Brazilian poet Ana Cristina Cesar who killed herself at the age of 31 in 1983. Icon of the marginal literature generation of Rio de Janeiro in the 1970s Ana Cristina leaves footprints wherever she goes leaving her feminine and oblique perspective for generations of yesterday and today. Starting from the appropriation of her literature by other artists Wide Sargasso Sea seeks to capture the beauty and originality of her writing whether through a drama play a ballet dance or through the poetry of young writers. The documentary brings Ana Cristina to the screen for the first time by showing historical images of her never seen before while builds a visual narrative from her poems.
