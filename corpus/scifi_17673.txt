As part of a civilization of survivors trapped deep beneath the ground Numa is entrusted a deadly mission. He must ascend to the Earth's surface and confirm whether it is once again inhabitable. But above ground he finds that the sun is not extinct as they were told nor are they the only survivors. Everything that they believed was a lie. At the Gorge of the desert Rela reveals Numa the truth: the Citadel that rules this part of the world has kept his people enslaved for centuries to provide them with clean energy from the planet's core. Numa is determined to gain access to the Citadel and head down to the Underland to change the fate of his people. But he will carry princess Desal back with him unaware of the fact that she truly is his people's worst enemy.
