This film is about social critic cartoonist and artist Lars Hillersberg. It was made in the last years of Hillersberg's life just before he passed away in the autumn of 2004 at 67 years of age. The film shows an eternally young eternally angry and - by his opponents within the establishment - eternally hated person. The film is filled with his images and develops into a great belly laugh about all things perverse stupid bigoted and narrow-minded.
