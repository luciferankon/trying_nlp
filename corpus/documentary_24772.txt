For over three decades Porfirio DÃ­az attempted to improve the overall conditions of an impoverished unstable and violent Mexico since he began his term in 1876. In this way he made sure he kept the peace that Mexico lacked in order to make development viable either by conciliation with his enemies of by straightforward repression. The 'Porfirian' governments helped reestablish the image of Mexico's damaged international reputation. This opened the doors to important foreign capital that allowed the construction of railroads the re-emergence of some industries and the birth of the incipient national market. However towards the closure of his regime the ancient dictatorship hadn't paid off a few important debts. On one hand the visible economical development was not beneficial to the vast majority of the Mexican population; and on the other the urban middle class that developed thanks to this progress aspired to have a political freedom and democratic rights stated by the constitution but that were non-existent in the praxis.
