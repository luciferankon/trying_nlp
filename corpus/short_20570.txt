This film charts the installation of Julian H. Scaff's landscape artworks called "Piles of Dirt" while simultaneously interviews with prominent artists and intellectuals interpret and comment on the work. The result is a journey both geographical as Scaff travels from Beirut to Amsterdam as well as intellectual as artists and critics attempt to peel back the layers of meaning in these deceptively simple public artworks.
