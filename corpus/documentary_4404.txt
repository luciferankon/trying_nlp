Surf music came out of Orange County California in the late fifties and early sixties. It exploded the radio waves along the coast line to become one of the most iconic genres of musical history. From the West to the East Surf Bands were popping up everywhere. One such band to emerge was a group of 12 to 14 year olds out of LA. These kids loved surfing the beach girls and most importantly... Surf Music. They were The New Dimensions and this is their story!
