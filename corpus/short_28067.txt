Once a year on the sacred day of Ashura (a shi'it holy day) the entire male population of 4 small villages at the edge of the Great Desert in Iran carry enormous wooden structures- some as 7 stories high- called The Cypress. This dying tradition has been captured on film for the first time in The Sacred Cypress.
