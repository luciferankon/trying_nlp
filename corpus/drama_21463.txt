Left to his own devices in an empty home the young Osgood Aimes goes to live in the forest camping out by the local freight line tracks. And that's where he's found his body and mind battered and bruised to an extent and yet unknown. The caretaker of the Aimes residence hires a physician to tend to the boy's body and a cobbler to repair the child's shoes. And it's through the boy's footwear that this craftsman learns his story and of his encounter.
