Welcome to The Revenge of the Great Camera Shootout 2012 (RGCSO) a Zacuto/Kessler production in association with Filmworkers Club & Tribeca Flashpoint Academy. This year is different from past Zacuto/Kessler Great Camera Shootouts. The test administered by Bruce Logan ASC shows two ways of looking at cameras-empirical and subjective with a strong emphasis on subjective. The test was conducted in February 2012 at the Tribeca Flashpoint Academy in Chicago and the color grading was completed using the Baselight color grading system at Filmworkers Club also in Chicago. Some camera manufacturers opted to color grade at other facilities but used the Baselight system as well. Zacuto acted as the central organizing body for the project and documented the production and post-production processes.
