We see multi award filmmaker Stephen Lloyd Jackson filmed over a two-year period as he embarks on a journey to produce his second installment SABLE FABLE in SAR Productions' 'sex and race' trilogy. 'SABLE FABLE - Behaind The Making Of An Indie Film' covers pre production principle photography post production winning two top awards in Miami at the American Black Film Festival (ABFF) and finally closing with the film's London premiere screening in Soho London 2014. During the film SLJ talks about sex race and the UK film industry. There are also comments from crew and cast working on SABLE FABLE. This is a raw in your face documentary film. Very strong language and contains scenes of a sexual nature.
