Henri Rousseau was a true amateur. His professional life was spent working as a customs official. But in his spare time he painted and was utterly convinced of the greatness of his art despite his complete lack of formal training. Although he was heavily criticized by many for his use of brightly colored images and child-like techniques he did bring a sense of vitality charm and innocence to his painting.
