Mimmo is a poet who learned to write while in exile. His father was a "boss" and as a child Mimmo repeatedly witnessed violence and murder in Palermo. But he didn't want to remain silent. The only "accomplice" he had to his conscience was a blank sheet of paper to which he held firmly. When his family discovered his writings hhis only choice was to either be killed as a witness or sent away in exile. His father guaranted his son's silence to the "organization" - but Mimmo was not to return until his father's death twenty years later.
