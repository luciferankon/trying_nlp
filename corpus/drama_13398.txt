Two young boys get in trouble with the law and wind up in prison. One who was raised in poverty in the slums goes to a reformatory and picks up tips on how to become a master criminal. When he gets out he refines his criminal skills but a stool-pigeon rats him out and he winds up in an adult prison and there he is subjected to severely regimented behavior inhuman conditions and brutal guards. The second boy comes from a wealthy family and is sent to prison for forging his father's signature--coincidentally the same prison where the poor boy who had been released but is back in for assaulting the stoolie and he become friends. When a member of the poor boy's gang is unjustly sentenced to death for the stoolie's murder the two boys escape to try to clear his name and find the real killer.
