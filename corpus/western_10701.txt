The Bar None Ranch has been run by Bess Allison ('Olive Hasbrouck' (qv)) ever since the death of her father left her in charge. But trouble breaks out with cattle been rustled and cowhands being killed. It is being done by a rustler know as Two White Pebbles because he puts two white pebbles under the head of a man he has killed. But Zip Wallace ('Hal Taliaferro' (qv) as Wally Wales) the son of an old friend of Bess Allison's father comes to the rescue...pretending to be a tenderfoot.
