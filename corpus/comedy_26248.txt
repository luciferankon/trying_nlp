This fresh cutting-edge comedy presents the truish adventures of Trump's confidants and bon vivants - family top associates heads of government golf pros and anyone else straying into his orbit - intrepidly exploring their histories and their psyches revealing insights into what makes them so definitively Trumpian. It's a workplace comedy where the office happens to be oval; it's a character study in search of character as seen through the eyes of an imaginary documentary crew.
