Art meets horror in End of Term where history is repeating itself at the Ford Barrington Art School. A group of students are tormented by the lingering menace of Garth Stroman an artist who had a disturbing vision fifty years prior. The pupils discover that true art can only be achieved through suffering and pain. With graduation fast approaching their celebrations turn into a twisted confrontation with medieval torture - all in the name of art.
