Privilege is an intelligently conceived boldly anarchic and wickedly insightful exposition on the culturally ingrained and socially divisive malaise of isms that artificially define and characterize empowerment in contemporary society: ageism sexism economic elitism and racism. Yvonne Rainer conveys texture through the inter-cutting of archival footage video and film - as well as compositional layering through the film-within-a-film structure elliptical (and self-referential) fusion of past and present and the filmmaker's idiosyncratic penchant for superimposed typed text.
