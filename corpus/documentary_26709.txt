INSPIRED is a documentary film chronicling several people's lives in the wake of the passage of Prop 8. Arresting live footage follows average people from all walks of life inspired to action in ways they never dreamed. Experience the passionate rallies and defiant marches of the new gay rights movement as it swept through Southern California. Intimate interviews reveal all the ways the movement comes together and the subtle and not-so-subtle ways it can be pulled apart from within. Shot in early 2009 our cast is anxiously awaiting for the California Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of Prop 8 and preparing for "Day of Decision." INSPIRED: THE VOICES AGAINST PROP 8 goes behind the headlines and propaganda to explore the real people who make up a movement. Footage from cast members and fans of INSPIRED: THE VOICES AGAINST PROP 8 giving us their reaction to the February 2012 ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals which upheld Judge Walker's overturning of Prop 8 is mixed with rallies that night in West Hollywood and inside Los Angeles City Hall.
