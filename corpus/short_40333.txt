Tondra and Doug believe they need pre-marital counseling but when they meet Relationships Expert Wayne Brown they get more than they bargained for. Wayne Brown does not believe in the traditional concept of marriage and instead has his own plan called "The Marriage Contract" where couples negotiate the terms of their marriage just like a union contract. Controversial yet thought provoking.
