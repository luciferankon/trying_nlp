Naked People Wearing Clothes (NPWC) is an experimental comedy. MacGuffin: a term used to describe an inanimate object that motivates a story and characters but of whose specific details contents and back-story is irrelevant. NPWC experiments with making the MacGuffin human and the results are as comical as they are poetic. You are a MacGuffin. We're all MacGuffins; haphazard threads in a web of jokes and a world of reticulated plots. We're all just naked people wearing clothes.
