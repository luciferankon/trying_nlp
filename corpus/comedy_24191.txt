Czech version of _"Everybody Loves Raymond" (1996)_ (qv). A young couple ('Sasa Rasilov (III)' (qv) and 'Jitka Schneiderov√°' (qv)) has three young children and loving parents who help them with love. The problem is that they do it all the time. Indeed they live across the street. And so the heroes are not responsible only for their children but also for the intrusive parents.
