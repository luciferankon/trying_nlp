An aleatory film: each reel begins and ends with a fade from or to a different color and contains two scenes. The film reels are supplied to the projectionist with a die with each of the colors on a side. The projectionist rolls the die to determine the running order of the reels. The story is designed so that each ordering creates different implications to the film as a whole.
