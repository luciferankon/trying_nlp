On Brian's last mission in Iraq a roadside bomb explodes. Brian wakes up in what he thinks is the hospital but really he is at the gates of Valhalla. As he comes to Freya tells him Odin will only welcome him to the "Hall of The Fallen" where only those who have died in battle may rest for eternity. If he can prevent the roadside bomb from killing everyone in the convoy Freya sends him back to Earth three days prior to the blast to set him on the journey of earning his way into Valhalla and saving his team members from certain death.
