MÃ©moire de missionnaires takes us back to the Belgian colonization of the Congo through the prism of evangelization. The last witnesses of this period tell us about the astonishing and little known fate of those men of the Church exiled on the edge of the world to preach the gospel. Their testimony give us a different perspective on this period. Those witnesses show a part of the colonial history which is often commented and yet remains unknown. They give us a lucid and critical view on the Christianization of Africa.
