In the developing world water-gathering is primarily a woman's job and rural Tibet is no exception. Three to four times a day she carries a heavy bucket to a potable source of water - sometimes as far as a mile away - and brings it back home 80-pounds full. Though necessary for her own survival and her family's this task is not only physically debilitating but the hours she spends doing it every day keep her from having time for an education a wage-earning job or even much-needed rest from her other exhausting responsibilities. WATER offers us a rare opportunity to witness this ritual as a Tibetan woman patiently and painstakingly collects water on her family's yak farm. Shot on location in remote Nangchen Tibet.
