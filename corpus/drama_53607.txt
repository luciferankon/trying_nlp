Alfonso VIII enters Toledo triumphantly and is immediately besotted by a young and beautiful Jewish woman who beckons him from her balcony. The Jewish woman is called Rachel and she is the niece of the Almojarife Aben Xuxem. The King resumes his governing duties but does not forget the Jewish woman and eventually makes her his mistress. But the relationship between them becomes so passionate and intense far from just another affair that the King forgets his duties and neglects his administrative obligations for some years and spends the whole time in the Galiana Palace his and Rachel's love nest.
