THE UNDOCUMENTED investigates the deaths of undocumented migrants in the Arizona desert and the efforts to return their remains to families in Mexico. Woven from multiple narrative threads the film depicts the efforts of Tucson's medical examiner and Mexican Consulate to name unidentified dead migrants. It follows Border Patrol agents who are challenged to balance law enforcement with lifesaving. In Mexico the film captures the reunification of the dead with their families and documents families whose loved ones left home to cross never to be heard from again. These characters provide an intimate view of the border and migrant deaths expressing a wide range of opinions on border policy and illegal immigration. The one thing they agree on is that migrant deaths must end.
