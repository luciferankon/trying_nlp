Erika wakes up terribly confused and without knowing where she is. She's tied up to a chair in a dark room with only a pale light of a lamp and the sound of a underground train in the background. She's terribly scared. As time passes her pain increases and also her uncertainty. She falls in a delirium that extends with her reflections about her life of prostitution and the bad life that she was given to her daughter. After an intense internal drama she finally finds a way to free herself but she doesn't know what lies on the other side of the door.
