This short promotes the movies. It shows that the "magic seat" of a movie theater can transport the movie-goer to all types of adventures such as the Oklahoma land rush; being rescued by a sheik in the Sahara Desert; watching a huge ape climb the Empire State Building; or experiencing a hurricane in the south Pacific. No matter what type of thrill your looking for you'll find it on the big screen.
