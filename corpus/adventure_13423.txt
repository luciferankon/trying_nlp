It's 1945 in the midst of WWII. The arch-villain known as "the villain" after causing havoc on the east coast now turns attentions to the west coast....specifically domestic wartime operations in Tustin California. After wrecking a local ship and tank-making plant now-unemployed welder Kaitlyn Kristin "Kittykat" Kay wishing she could do something to stop the Villain's machinations finds herself in receipt of an odd-looking box sent to her by her "colored" boyfriend from oversees. Inside said box is a tiger-patterned "catsuit" that once she puts it on gives her catlike speed strength and other feline attributes....including a cat's nine lives. And she'll need every one of them as she takes on the Villain and the villain's hatted henchmen in a series of daring and life-ending cliffhangers reminiscent of the 1930's-50's movie serials that this project is a loving if slightly snaky tribute to/take on.
