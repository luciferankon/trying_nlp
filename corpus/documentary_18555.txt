Elephant Refugees addresses the plight of wild elephants as seen through the eyes of a couple that established a bush lodge in a remote location in Botswana in 2005. Business was good until several key events changed the dynamics: (1) Botswana was declared a poacher-free zone. (2) Hunting was banned causing hunting camps to close and 17 boreholes (wells) to be capped; elephants had relied on this water source for 50 - 70 years. (3) The elephant population has increased dramatically due to poaching in neighboring countries. The elephants are desperate and those unable to access the small amount of water available in the camp's watering hole dig up pipes break into chalets and tear down water tanks searching for water. As the damage continues and the financial toll escalates the family's ability to keep the bush lodge open to tourists - who provide the money to pay for the water - is in jeopardy.
