Cattlemen use Alamo Pass in order to get their cattle to market. A gang has taken it over and charges a toll to go through it. When one rancher doesn't have enough money to pay the toll he winds up dead. A local rancher Bill Bowers investigates the killing but his neighbor and rival Molly Spellman decides to take her cattle around the pass instead of through it to avoid the toll. The gangsters kidnap her and Bill gathers the other ranchers in the area for a final showdown with the gang.
