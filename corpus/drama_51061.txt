In a town where there are high rollers fast cars beautiful people and at any given moment someone famous could and will walk right by you there are two groups of high school kids living on the opposite sides of the Vegas Strip. The rich kids on the Aliante side have everything that money can buy. It is not as easy for the kids on the Eastside. They work for their cars food to eat and a place to stay. Things get harder when both sides are forced together by an unexpected relationship between two kids from opposite sides of the Strip. Imagine what happens when all their worlds collide... sounds like Vegas.
