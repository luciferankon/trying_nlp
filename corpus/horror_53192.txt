Twenty-five years ago an experimental drug called doxital saved Eric Shepherds life. Doxital could grow back severed limbs and bring life back to the newly dead. Doxital was legalized and made available for public use. The doxital that was sold to the public spoiled and turned those who took it into the walking dead. The dead are harmless and walk among the living. Now the time has come for the dead and the living to part ways.
