A family drama of powerful intensity Kevin Nash's debut feature takes its cue from the Mike Leigh playbook. A young American woman arrives in England seeking to reconnect with her father's family only to find them peculiarly reticent about her arrival. Delving deeper she slowly uncovers a web of trauma deceit and repressed memory attached to her father's legacy. Brimming with excellent performances and powerful scenes of dramatic revelation Nash's control of a drama predominantly set in one house is impressive especially given that the performances here are largely improvised. During a lecture tour of England Scarlett an American psychologist decides to look up Amy her half-sister and find out about her father who died 10 years earlier. She is surprised to encounter a family that won't communicate with her or each other about the past. Just when Amy starts to open about their father the family creates a wall of secrecy and lies surrounding his death. Scarlett delves further into the truth but when the truth is finally revealed it shatters the stability of the family causing all of the family and Scarlett to reassess their relationship to one another. The film explores the dangers both of keeping secrets and digging them up.
