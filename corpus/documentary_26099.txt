All postmen are marathon runners. Every day kilometers and kilometers pass under their feet while they deliver letters. But the main character of this story Trajche Mighov is probably the only postman in the world who has run 220 kilometers for 24 hours. He is not just a marathon runner he is a marathon runner with a "degree". The story of Trajche slowly moves to a kind of a "saga" about the letter as a mean of communication among people. Whether the profession postman is dying? What if all communication amongst people is exchanged electronically? Will there be people who will never receive a love letter or a Christmas card from a postman? Trajche doesn't want to believe in this scenario.
