When Kevin O'Donnell was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig's disease his wife Jodi did all she could for her husband. Along with no cure for her dying husband Jodi realized that there were no resources for her daughter Alina who was a young child trying to understand why her once healthy daddy could no longer talk or walk and was wheelchair bound. After Kevin passed away Jodi decided to do something about this. She formed Hopes Love Company which is the only non-profit organization specifically created to support the children and young adult family members of ALS patients. Hope Loves Company is a resource that families can turn to for support. At their premier program Camp HLC children and young adults gather to share their experiences and to cry laugh and find friendship with others in their same situation. From one small woman has come an organization that continues to help so many children and families deal with this most tragic of diseases. Since it's inception in 2012 Camp HLC has provided camping retreats throughout the United States and this past summer Hope Loves Company took their teens on their first international excursion to Iceland where they shared what they learned at Camp HLC with the ALS families of Iceland. This heart-wrenching and heart-warming documentary tells the story of Jodi O'Donnell Ames and Hope Loves Company.
