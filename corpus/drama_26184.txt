With the Vietnam War raging in 1969 two young fathers report for duty. A man of great faith and a doubtful cynic. A quarter-century later their sons Wayne and John Paul (David A.R. White and Kevin Downes) meet as strangers. Guided by handwritten letters from their fathers from the battlefield they embark on an unforgettable journey to The Wall-the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C. Along the way they discover the devastation of war cannot break the love of a father for his son.
