Basically an early-day infomercial made for theatrical release by the Stewart-Warner Company. Garage owner Emmett Sheldon's business is losing money but after vising a restaurant and theatre that have been modernized by installing his is convinced by a salesman (Leon Ames) a Stewart-Warner representative that he should install an "Alemite" lubricating system and make his garage-station attractive to customers. Needles to add he does and his business and profits grow...mostly because the ad agency wrote the script.
