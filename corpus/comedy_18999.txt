Nerds of Steele is a family friendly feature length buddy road trip comedy starring up and coming country music star Ansel Brown and retired NFL great Sean Gilbert. Ansel Brown plays hit country music sensation Zack Steele who becomes the object of a hero's quest by four just graduated nerd fans Mary Beth Hera Susan and Vern. The four nerds follow Ansel Brown across the state of North Carolina in the hopes of recovering special back stage concert passes that have been stolen by two frat boys who tormented our heroes all through college. This struggle for Mary Beth Hera Susan and Vern to overcome their bullies and their own social awkwardness to make their dreams come true is a light hearted fun and hilarious comedic journey.
