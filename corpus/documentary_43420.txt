This is the story of 'eastern lights'. The first ever Chinese camp at the legendary burning man festival. The camp is built by a group of young and passionate creative types and entrepreneurs from China. This is the first time most of them will be going to Burning Man. It is a group of 60 people. They come from very diverse backgrounds: engineers programmers bankers designers architects filmmakers. What unites them is creativity and devoted spirit. In China they would be regarded as an assembly of well-known creative entrepreneurs. They are seeking community and want to build friendships and hope to equally share with those treasures from our own culture and traditions. They also go to burning man with a strong sense of giving a window into the creative and startup culture of China to their western counterparts a window into the way of thinking and doing things as Asians and as Chinese. Into a community that normally is not so easily accessible for Westerns because of its language and culture barriers. In China normally people follow certain rules that sometimes make it difficult to connect with others. At Burning Man they want to build a camp with those who seek a new perspective and who welcome growth through connections with others. Thus they are working hard to build a camp called "Eastern Lights".
