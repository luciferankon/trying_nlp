Seventy-five years of life in Northern Ireland recorded by the people who live there is chronicled in a new landmark television series. Never before broadcast footage of life in Northern Ireland shot through the eyes of local people and the lens of a home movie camera. The series has condensed hundreds of hours of home movie footage shot by local people to form the "people's archive" of life in Northern Ireland through the decades. Super 8 Stories produced by Double-Band Films will feature people at work sporting moments and historical events coupled with the musical classics from each era. Footage spanning much of the 20th century has been donated by people from Craigavon to Coleraine from Beleek to Ballymena and is certain to provoke nostalgic memories of bygone times. The home movies will show personal and intimate footage capturing people relaxing on holiday in Fermanagh enjoying the show band heydays of the Sixties electric trams ruling the streets of Belfast and the start of the Troubles.
