Through a variety of film styles that provide a surrealistic sensory overload Slovak director Juraj Jakubisko provides three war stories that treat the fragility of the humankind through different approaches with Death as a common denominator appearing in all stories. In the first chapter (WWI) a gypsy deserts the army to return to his town for a wedding. To protect himself he dresses up as a woman. However the Hussars spot him unleashing violent confrontations in the village. In the second chapter (WWII) Russian partisans kill an old man suspected of being a German spy. The news that the war is over scatters. Celebrations begin. But a German unit is unaware of this and stumbles upon the celebration. In the third chapter (Post-Apocalyptic Nuclear Holocaust) two survivors begin an extensive search for other remaining people but Death seeks them out too.
