Sannya is a street urchin who commands respect in his area. He earns a living by selling stuff at signals and has a gang of followers ready to do anything for him. Sannya is principled though. He believes in earning a living rather than taking to stealing and doesn't tolerate anyone exploiting him or his friends. One fine day he comes across millionaire Shreyas Kale (Khapre) an arrogant and narcissistic businessman. While Sannya is just trying to sell garlands to him Kale gets agitated and slaps Sannya. That slap and a drunk-driving incident seals Kale's fate. Sannya blackmails his way into Kale's house and life. Surprisingly for him he's accepted in the family by Kale's wife (Chitra) and he ends up uniting the family.
