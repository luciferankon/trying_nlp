Set in the northern Algerian port city of Mostaganem. The title refers to the hordes of refugees the 'Harragas' who smuggle themselves out of the country via any means possible. Here we meet one such group Rachid Nasser and Imene who pay a smuggler Hassan to take them to Spain in his rickety boat. Along with a group of African and Arab migrants they are risking all they have to cross the stormy Straits.
