In early-twentieth-century middle-Europe villagers are literally becoming petrified. Although the authorities try to hush the matter up it is apparent that at the full moon Megaera a Gorgon leaves her castle lair and anyone looking on her face is turned to stone. When this fate befalls a visitor experts from the University of Leipzig arrive to try and get to the bottom of it all. When his father Professor Jules Heitz and brother Bruno die under mysterious circumstances Paul Heitz travels to a small town to determine what is going on. It's the early 1900s and he finds villagers who are wary of strangers and apparently live in fear particularly when there is a full moon. He hears of the legend of Megaera a Gorgon so hideous that to look at her will turn you to stone. Of particular interest to him are Dr. Namaroff and his attractive assistant Carla Hoffman. Namaroff is obviously hiding something and is very possessive of Carla who suffers from blackouts and memory loss. With the help of his mentor Professor Karl Meister Paul tries to unlock the secrets around them.
