A day passed in Paris in the company of the Spanish writer Enrique Vila-Matas. On the way to the studio of Spanish painter Miquel Barceló who hopes to portray him Vila-Matas is telling delivered confessions about his youth and the eccentric image he projected to the world as a way to attract attention to his literary work. The encounter with the painter creates an intense dialogue with numerous generational references while his portrait emerges on the canvas. A second visit to the painter's workshop highlights the complicity between the two artists and favors the birth of a collaboration a literary text to accompany an exhibition of Barceló called "Sipiesca".
