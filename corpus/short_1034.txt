A film to obliterate the illusions that distract from a real life. The Pigtail Shadow is a false idol a false prophet promising a jeweled path out of reality. Teeming with music words and imagery this film induces a meditative and blissful state. The sweet and nimble reading by Kristin Hersh places an ethereal tone over a lush and swirling soundtrack. Cerio gently dismantles the collective subconscious and thoroughly mocks the human drama. Moments shift between the candied ecstasy of childhood and a teasing cynicism. Spotlights shine on our shifting superstitions in this cautionary tale.
