Sid Gibson is a soap powder salesman who decides what he really needs is TV advertising. The problem is he's absolutely broke. He calls upon his friend Arthur Ashton who arranges to sneak a plug for Sid's suds into a live TV spectacular. The public goes bananas for the product but to maintain sales Sid and Arthur must arrange for ever more outrageous plugs on TV shows. The Ascots races the Edinburgh Military Tattoo - no show is safe.
