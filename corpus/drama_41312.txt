Homer Garcon is an unpublished and frustrated science fiction writer living off the success of his wife Trude Garcon-Moore a busy Hollywood producer. As a result he finds himself "trapped" in lavish surroundings - his luxury jail - and with publisher rejection letters piling high Homer has convinced himself of his wife's infidelity. Phillips' darkly-comic script follows Homer as he dives into the prickly territories of self-awareness and self pity in his quest to find the truth about his possibly cheating wife--and himself--all at a Valentine's Day dinner decidedly set for three. A largely dialogue-driven film A Swingin' Trio is about four things: love music betrayal and one really good dinner.
