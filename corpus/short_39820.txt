Four lost souls glide through monotonous motions candy bar munching and murder. There's the man in the car with binoculars eating a rocky road bar. There's the woman and the man wearing glasses walking up to a motel with infinite rooms. There's a man in a yellow poncho dragging a body across an empty field.
