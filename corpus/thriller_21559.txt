Nightmare U is a genre-bending narrative show that brings equal parts chilling horror and campy comedy together as we follow the adventure of a monster hunting class in the University. This rag tag group of classmates is the only thing standing between the school and a host of monsters zombies and demons straight from your worst nightmares.
