Darius Weems a 15-year-old with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy had never left his hometown of Athens Georgia. In the summer of 2005 he and a group of young college students traveled across the country in a wheelchair-accessible RV to test accessibility in the United States. Their ultimate goal was to reach Los Angeles and convince MTV's hit show "Pimp My Ride" to customize Darius's wheelchair. Along the way they found joy brotherhood and the knowledge that life even when imperfect is always worth the ride.
