Aymas the 55-year-old protagonist of the film has seen a lot in his life. He comes from steppes to a remote provincial town in southern Kazakhstan only to suffer another blow of fate. A lawyer from Germany brings along bitter news that Aymas's only daughter has passed away and left her fortune to his father. Butas it seems neither the death of her daughter nor the sudden wealth has any impression on him. Perhaps it'because the image of her daughter has almost been erased from Aymas's memory - he hasn't seen her for more than 25 years and the only reminder of her existence is an amateur film footage depicting her face... Aimlessly Aymas wanders along the streets of the town which is constantly filled with fog.Fog lies both in the streets and in Aymas's brains. The fog can only be dispelled by wind or a girl named Samal whom Aymas accidentally meets in the fog. If fact the word samal means 'wind' in Central Asia. The girl is really like the wind - she's wayward impulsive and unpredictable. She behaves exactly like she pleases. She scatters foundations. She's in love with another girl and she's very unhappy. To Aymas Samal reminds of his daughter. And he really wishes Samal to become his daughter. For her sake Aymas delves into a series of adventures with unpredictable consequences. It seems to him that they're getting closer to each other. But how can you can get closer to the wind and lock it into a cage? In Central Asia 'samal' means 'wind'. Who knows what she is looking for. What does she prefer. Difference. Lost. Suffering. Pain. Silence. Fear. Screaming. Impersonality. Insensibility. Living with lie. Just love or... 'Home for Samal' is a story about young woman with very special character. She is very energetic she brake rules. She is bisexual and ... very unhappy.
