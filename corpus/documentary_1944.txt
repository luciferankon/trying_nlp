What happened once the waters receded the beaches were cleaned up and the aid organizations left? Silent Waters provides an intimate glimpse into the lives of fishing communities on an undeveloped Thai island in the Andaman Sea. The immense power from the waves destroyed the main village of 200 households. Many survivors moved to the mainland too afraid to return. Those that chose to re-build their lives on the island recap their memories of that fateful day and how they coped after losing their families homes and livelihood. They talk about their concerns for the future and how their unique lifestyle will likely change with the arrival of electricity.
