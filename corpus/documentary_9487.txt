The history of the northern german town called Kiel is quite old. And it was already old when witches were burning there. In 1676 April 25th the protocolls of Kiel mention "ein Metjen nahmens Preetzen" (a maiden named Preetzen). She's accusing her stepmother doing "godless things" and flying to the "dark hill". Two months later two witches are burning - the last witches of Kiel. Was the little german coast town a city of crazy inquisitors and witchhunters? Absolutely not! But still: it happened. Furthermore: it had to happen. The maiden tells the whole story. Her name is Anje Preetzen. She's 350 years old. The memory of the maiden is filled up with pictures of the 17th century: full of barock paintings woodprints copperprints and documents of the Kieler court. "Ein Metjen nahmens Preetzen" is her history her story an illustrated hearplay an experiment to listen to the past talking about itself.
