An unnamed character impulsively decides to take a trip to Italy. As we follow him through his day we encounter a number of tangential ranting and strange characters amongst the suburban landscape of Richmond Hill on one hot summer's day. The characters express themselves to one another whether they are friends or not completely unfiltered.
