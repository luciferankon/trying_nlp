After Jungle Jim finds an American army captain's dog tags among the remains of a dead pygmy he joins a U.S. military investigation not only to find the missing soldier Captain Ann Kingsley but also to look into a recently discovered kind of rope that will not burn or break. The pygmy had been killed by the Bush Devil cult but little is known of them. In fact others are after the plant used to make this indestructible rope fiber and it's up to Jungle Jim to stop them. He will face crocodiles stampeding elephants and a gorilla along the way.
