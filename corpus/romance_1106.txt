Lolette ( Theda Bara ) an exotic and spirited peasant girl lives In the small Spanish village of Juanguera . Although ardently courted by the native swains and particularly a bandit called The Tiger Lolette prefers Maurice Tabor a French artist who has come to Juanguera to paint. Because he refuses to take her to Paris Lolette accepts a gift of stolen jewels from The Tiger and follows Maurice to France. With Lolette as his model Maurice paints brilliantly and soon she becomes a Paris sensation. One evening Lolette performs a Spanish dance on stage and the next day she signs contracts with a number of impresarios accepting advance payment from all of them. Fearing her arrest Maurice urges her to accompany him back to Spain but The Tiger attacks their coach and imprisons them. At a feast held in her honor however Lolette urges The Tiger to drink and when he is unconscious she and Maurice escape.
