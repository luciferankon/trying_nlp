Possibly the final trip for a cove fisherman steaming out from a village in the teeth of aggressive re-branding. Hand-processed Super 8 reversal film & compact audio cassette. An audio-visual stream of consciousness. Entirely unedited in terms of writing performance and visuals. A homage to the spontaneous prose of The Beats from the mythical Cornish west.
