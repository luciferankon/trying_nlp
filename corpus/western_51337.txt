The Cisco Kid and Pancho hold up a stagecoach and kidnap Ellen Roth. They take the girl who is wanted on a murder charge to the mission where Padre Angelo will look after her. She tells Cisco of a mysterious Doctor Willis who called on an aged woman she had been nursing and gave her an overdose of sleeping pills. Convinced that Ellen is innocent Cisco sets out to prove it. He goes to Bill Hastings where he makes a deal to turn Ellen in if Cisco gets part of the money Hastings will inherit when she is convicted. With Ellen safely in jail Cisco and Pancho force the local newspaper to run a story saying that Doc Willis has been apprehended. Hastings makes another deal with Cisco to kill Ellen before she testifies against Doc.
