The film portrays the life of a family separated from the mainstream of modern society yet containing within its microcosm the complex layers and dramas of human relationship: conjugal life sexual trauma and the failures and bonds of fatherhood brother and sisterhood. The film is about a unique social stratum in a remote place in Vietnam with unspoken traditions customs and lifestyles. But most of all it is the universal story of a family that like all other families have to find the strength and direction in each other to navigate their way through the choices and consequences that make up human existence.
