The atmosphere and morals of the 70s and 80s is clearly felt in my film as this is what informed much of Malga Kubiak's life and work as well as the in-depth expression of Kubiak's complex psychological and sexual lifestyle and belief system which constantly challenges the viewer to follow understand and empathize even when it seems impossible! No film about such a wildly underground and consequent artist would be complete without a healthy dose of anarchy!
