This interestingly presented "making-of" for the Crusades film _Kingdom of Heaven (2005)_ (qv) is organized so that the viewer can view the documentary however they like. Plenty of interviews are present as well as an abundance of exclusive behind-the-scenes footage only available in this documentary.
