He's a thirty-year-old man-child whose dreams of becoming an artistic success have been thwarted in the biggest way possible- he's the lowest of the low in the creative industry... a wedding videographer! Haunted by visions of his 5-year-old self crying at what he's become Brandon is ready to give up all hope until one day he gets a mysterious phone call from his childhood mentor "Commander" Mark Kistler. Brandon's world rapidly unravels and a wacky plot involving killer mechazoid robots and time travel ensues.
