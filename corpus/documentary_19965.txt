Everyone has heard the story of President Kennedy's murder and most have been left feeling very confused. Conspiracy Theorists Lie is the story you haven't heard; an in depth look at the half-century of lies created and perpetuated by conspiracy theorists to sell merchandise gain attention and advance nutty agendas. The film also features some of the funny and disturbing interactions that Director James K. Lambert had with conspiracists in Dealey Plaza during the 50th Anniversary. These conversations were sparked by Mr. Lambert who handed out anti-conspiracy booklets throughout the day. Professional journalists and well educated people still treat the question of who killed JFK as if it were debatable but it is not. The kind of paranoid thinking that allows people to believes it is possible to murder a president and cover it up for five decades is no better than believing that the Moon Landing and the Holocaust were faked and it needs to be exposed as such. Conspiracy Theorists Lie is the first film to speak truth to nonsense and confront the poisonous nature of conspiracy theories head on.
