'On The War On Drugs' is a documentary film that aims to highlight progressive ideas arguments and practice that critique current prohibitionist drug policies. Through an examination of its historical origins and adverse human impact we hope to promote a broader and more critical understanding of prohibition. Through this film we are endeavouring to both encourge and contribute to much needed discussion about how best to regulate the consumption of different psychoactive substances.
