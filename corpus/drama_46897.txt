The old man Carl-Henrik de Gr√©vy left his family many years ago when the stock market collapsed. His sister Louise believes that he is dead and wants to get control of her brother's property being the sole inheritor. The Sneijder's live on one of the old man's manors. They have also lost their money but as a sign of friendship he promised them before he left that they will stay there for as long as they live. Louise and her 'creative' lawyer is trying to find a way to get rid of the Sneijder's. It seems as if the only hope they have is that the old man returns.
