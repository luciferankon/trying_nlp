A new feature film about two people engaging in a desperate act of togetherness. It is the story of a woman who enters into a contract authored by a man who asks her to both be his wife and to slowly poison him over the course of his remaining years. They never speak of the contract after it is signed but nevertheless develop a deepening connection in their time together. It is a story of the lengths to which we will go to simply find a moment of togetherness in a vast and indifferent world.
