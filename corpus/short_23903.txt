Beauty turns into revulsion as a woman chokes inside of her own packaging. The ideal woman is not only supposed to maintain an immaculate home but a sanitized body as well. Her beauty has been removed from her control and sold back to her at a marked-up price. Packaged Goods explores this process of commodification and questions our desire for packaged beauty. The female body is quarantined to the point of repulsion and beauty rituals are pushed to the extreme.
