For winemaker Timothy Milos wine is the "voice of the vineyard". Wine is the living quintessence of all that went into creating it - the land the weather the people and ultimately the fruit - each bottle a liquid time capsule. In 2013 the viticultural conditions in Napa and Sonoma were nearly perfect - with Mother Nature leaving the critical decision of when to pick entirely up to the winemaker. And for Milos this resulted in one of his finest Vintages ever - including his first 100 score from America's most acclaimed wine critic.
