Beyond a sprinkling of people from his locality Evered Wigg is someone nobody is likely to have heard of. In the early 1920s the village of Kessingland in Suffolk had its own cinema the Kinnodrome. It was built and run by this unsung pioneer of radio inventor and visionary. Against the backdrop of Kessingland this documentary by Nick Murray Brown looks at the life of a remarkable character. With more than a hint of nostalgia it is also a human story hopefully relevant in today's world.
