When he came to Dion's office his fianc√©e Silvi a beautiful but unreligious girl was caught in an elevator with Raka a religious innocent and strange young man who worked for Dion. Fearing that this would be the end of his life Silvi vowed if survived he would change his life become a Muslim woman who is obedient to God's command. It turned out that for a second after he said that the elevator door suddenly opened. Since then Silvi always overshadowed Raka who always reminds Silvi promise in the elevator. And after a few unfortunate attacks on Silvi it was Raka who finally helped him until Silvi found his resolve. But not necessarily Dion agrees with Silvi's vow.
