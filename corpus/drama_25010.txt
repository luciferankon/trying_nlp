The story of a son who is afraid of everything. Overwhelmed by his dull life one day he decides to flee. He starts a journey to nowhere living other lives. And he finds out that if one day you no longer want to grow it's not all that bad. You just have to learn to fly to fly far away. It's a story about taking important decisions; and about how each time we make a choice somewhere within us we make exactly the opposite one.
