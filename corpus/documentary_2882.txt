Gorillas A Journey for Survival In late 2001 from the rain forests of Cameroon four helpless baby western lowlands gorillas were taken away after their mothers had been killed by poachers. The infant gorillas were later taken to Nigeria and kept in the Ibadan zoo. Documents were forged certifying that the four gorillas were born in the Ibadan zoo thus making it possible for the four gorillas to be smuggled through South Africa to Malaysia. After several years they mysteriously ended up in South Africa at the National Zoological Gardens. However this was not meant to be their final destination. This film chronicles the excitement of returning the Taiping Four home. It features the Gorillas' emotional and intensive journey from South Africa into the Limbe Wildlife Centre in Cameroon. Footage of hunters and ex-hunters reveal the truths and myths about the bush meat trade and explain the world of poachers and gorilla hunters in the Cameroon.
