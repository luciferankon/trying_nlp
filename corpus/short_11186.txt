NYC poet Paolo Javier invited filmmaker Lynne Sachs to create a film that would speak to one of his poems from his newly published book Court of the Dragon (Nightboat Books). Sachs chose Stanza 10 from Javier's poem 'Starfish Aorta Colussus'. She then decided to collaborate with film artist Sean Hanley in the editing of the film. Together they traveled through 25 years of unsplit Regular 8 mm film that Sachs had shot -- including footage of the A.I.D.S. Quilt from the late 1980s a drive from Florida to San Francisco and a journey into a very untouristic part of Puerto Rico. Throughout the process Sachs and Hanley explore the syntactical ruptures the celebration of nouns and the haunting resonances of Javier's poetry.
