In June 2010 leaders from the twenty largest economies met in Toronto with representatives of corporate interests to discuss the policies that would shape the world for everyone else. Exclusion zones overlapping layers of security fencing and an estimated 25000 police and military personnel transformed the downtown area into an armed camp. Over 1.3 billion dollars were spent on security measures more than all previous G8/G20 meetings combined. This documentary traces the overt breakdown in civil liberties that occurred during the Summit from unmarked vans with snatch squads of plainclothes police to the pre-emptive arrest of activists now facing years in prison for organizing demonstrations.
