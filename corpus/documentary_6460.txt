MARLUKU WIRLINYI is a tale of kangaroo hunting that weaves its way through Dreamtime to the present and back again. A group of old Warlpiri men transport us back to a time of rarely heard history and we follow their journey into the present. Songs stories and dance relate the importances of the past to the present. Old meets new youth meets the elderly traditional hunting meets the modern world. MARLUKU WIRLINYI reflects a very personalised insight into how a small section of Indigenous Australia is measuring their rapidly changing world. MARLUKU WIRLINYI is an assertion of survival and an expression of cultural resilience.
