A young couple reluctantly answers their door during a rainstorm and in rushes a soaked bloodied and estranged friend who insists that someone is trying to kill him. This triggers a non-stop night that forces all three of them to confront their own darkest secrets as well as an even larger threat that comes knocking. We are all prisoners of our own subjective views and experiences. The majority of Sympathy Said the Shark is told from the explicit point-of-view of its three main characters. Every time the POV switches there is an overlap of time where we see or hear something that the previous character missed thus continuously changing the opinion of who's good who's bad and what is really going on... When a young couple opens their door to a soaked bloodied and estranged friend they quickly discover that their night is going to get even stranger... Each person's perspective uncovers a darker secret until an even larger threat is right outside.
