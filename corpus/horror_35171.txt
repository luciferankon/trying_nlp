Sarah is a 17 year old girl struggling to come to terms with the death of her best friend Abigail. Offered the chance to get away from the rumours and recriminations that surround the death Sarah attends a school trip to a remote farm house with a group of similarly disaffected students and their apparently caring teachers. It is on the trip that Sarah attempts to piece together the horrific events of the previous weeks that plague her and it is there that she uncovers a truth so terrifying that it threatens to plunge them all into madness.
