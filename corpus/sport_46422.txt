There are three modes of play all of which can be played by one or two players. These include Bowling Challenge and Practice. In Bowling players play a standard game of bowling. In Challenge players must knock down all of the pins that appear with only once chance to do so as the pin set-ups become increasingly difficult. Players are given more points for knocking all of the pins down depending on the difficulty of the shot. In Practice players may choose from 28 different pin variations. When playing with another player players pass the Virtual Boy back and forth in between turns.
