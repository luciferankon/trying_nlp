This homage to the childhood days of the motion pictures starts in 1910 when the young attorney Leo Harrigan by chance meets a motion picture producer. Immediately he's invited to become a writer for him - the start of a sensational career. Soon he's promoted to a director and shoots one silent movie after the other in the tiny desert village Cacamonga with a small crew of actors. But the competition is hard: the patent agency sends out Buck Greenway to sabotage them. When they visit L.A. his crew is surprised by a new species: fans! Going from a lawyer to a writer and then to a film director is the career path on which we find the bashful Leo Harrigan. But Leo has problems as well such as being hopelessly smitten with his leading lady who chooses to reward his attentions by getting herself hitched to Harrigan's vulgar leading man Buck Greenaway! This movie is based extremely loosely on the early career of Cecil B. De Mille.
