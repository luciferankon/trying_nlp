A moving story about family growing up and breaking free from the restraints of family constellations. A beautiful summers day perfect for a family garden party. Not for Thomas whose mother convinced him to celebrate his 25th birthday in a closed circle with his family. Thomas is in a difficult life phase; his long-term girlfriend left him and his degree appears useless. The last thing he was missing was his father looking down on him and his mother patronizing him. The celebration takes place in familiar ways but Thomas fumes more and more with every conversation. Not even his little sister who he has a good relationship with can save the situation. Today might just be the day to clear the air.
