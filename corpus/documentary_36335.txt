Media mogul and Democratic US Congressman William Randolph Hearst once owned and operated the world's most powerful media empire. The real-life inspiration behind Orson Welles' classic film "Citizen Kane" Hearst built an extravagant retreat in the hills of San Simeon CA to entertain the wealthy elite of his time. US Presidents business tycoons and Hollywood movie stars frequented his mansion in its heyday. The estate was donated to the state of California by Hearst Corporation in 1957. It is currently maintained by the state as a museum and historic park.
