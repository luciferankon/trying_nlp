Yaki just wanted to make a porn film. As a child growing up in an ultra-orthodox family (very religious) he never even heard about this "dubious" genre. Actually he never even encountered the world of television and film. After shooting his little film he starts developing his interest in video-art with the help of his good friend Ricardo. Through this medium he explores the connection between sex and religion myth and anxiety body and soul. This is his self portrait.
