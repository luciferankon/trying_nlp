Jim Hanvey is a genial but top-notch detective who has retired to his country home. An insurance company hires him to find a missing emerald so they won't have to pay out the $100000 for which the jewel is insured. It doesn't take him long to find the emerald but he discovers that finding it was the easy part; the difficult part is getting it back to its rightful owner and he winds up involved in a murder in which an innocent man is framed.
