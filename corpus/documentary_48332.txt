Under Lew Grade Associated Television - an ITV franchise for the midlands - relocates from its crumbling studios at Aston in Birmingham over to the city centre having invested millions of pounds in a purpose-built studio complex for colour television - the first of its kind in Europe. Legendary soap opera Crossroads moves over to these studios and as ATV establishes itself there in the 1970s new programmes include cult children's show Tiswas and darts game show Bullseye. In the early eighties the IBA force ATV to restructure as Central ordering the new company to cover more of the east midlands. Money is spent on new studios in Nottingham which seems to spell the demise of ATV Centre.
