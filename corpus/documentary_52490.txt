Mark Twain said that "Travel is fatal to prejudice bigotry and narrow-mindedness and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad wholesome charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime." The Art of Being Métis is one part of a four-part project that also includes The Art of Being Haida The Art of Being Inca and The Art of Being Inuit. People have a natural affinity with traditionally built water craft. We have learned in our travels in much the same way that Twain must have experienced new people and cultures that when you have a chance to commence a conversation with a common interest that what you may have thought of as culturally different was just another way to look at life the earth and the community that all people can share together if we have open minds. The Art of Being Métis follows the making of a traditional birch bark canoe and how through the teachings of the canoe we can learn about the Métis and Indigenous cultures. The making of the canoe melts away and the teachings and perspectives of a culture come alive in this full feature documentary. The theme of the documentary is that we can all live in concert with Mother Nature and each other and greet each other as we really are: one tribe one community one people.
