Georgie Godwin housebound for 23 yearsis the fattest man in Britain a tourist attraction thanks to greedy 'agent' cabbie Morris who brings visitors to Rochdale to hear Georgie sing and - rather to his annoyance - touch him. Devoted neighbour Janice is Georgie's only other regular outside contact until he meets Amy a pregnant teenager fleeing a violent boyfriend whom he takes in as a lodger. Touched by his kindness she feels he demeans himself and wants him to lose weight for his own safety. Morris however encourages Georgie to pile on the pounds as a money-spinner for them both arranging for him to take part in a local television weigh-in to see if he is fatter than rival claimant Big Brian. Amy is horrified but Georgie sees it as almost a calling. Will he beat Brian or will tragedy strike the fattest man in Britain?
