F. Lee Baily hosted this short-lived (four months) interview program on ABC- TV. Similar in format to "Person to Person" on CBS in the 1950s this series was executive-produced by David Susskind. John Aaron who had created "Person to Person" started as producer of this series but was fired by Susskind after preparing just one episode. Susskind said he wanted harder- hitting interviews than Aaron was producing.
