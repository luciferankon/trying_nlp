The Gawad Kalinga (GK) movement is sweeping across the Philippines and overseas and the Philippine film industry will not be left behind in being a part of it. Three inspiring stories of ordinary people touched by Gawad Kalinga are highlighted in the movie "Paraiso: Tatllong Kwento in Pag-Asa." (Paradise: Three Stories of Hope). The title of the movie Paraiso meaning Paradise is simply what GK has been to the masses as the grassroots movement is radically rebuilding the country one family at a time. The GK Trilogy: Umiyak Man Ang Langit (Even If Heaven Cries) is based on Jocelyn's life experiences who lost loved ones in the mudslides of St. Bernard S. Leyte. The story captures the pain the internal struggles and the healing that takes place in all of us once faced with life-changing events. Ang Kapatid Kong Si Elvis (My Brother Elvis) is a story on a lighter note centered on a boy who ate pebbles to satisfy his hunger and a GK volunteer's family who adopted him as their own. The story captures the challenges and rewards of being involved with GK. Marie is a story based on how a tragic loss can be turned into a living legacy and a new beginning. Marie Rose Abad perished in the twin tower tragedy of 9/11. Rudy Abad honors his wife with a living legacy.
