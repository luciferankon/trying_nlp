Gene joins in the fight against Morgan and his men who are trying to run infected cattle to the railroad. When Morgan's man shoots the Sheriff Gene runs in the election to replace him. Morgan accuses Gene of the murder but Gene wins anyway and it's not long before he gets the chance to nab Morgan and his gang. Colima County Texas has barred the entry of cattle from fever-ridden Sage County where two unscrupulous schemers Morhan and Conners have bought up thousands of head of the cattle suffering from hoof-and-mouth disease (before the USDA decided to call it foot-and-mouth even though cattle don't have feet) for a song. Driving the cattle to a rail shipping point by crossing a corner of Colima Country they are spotted and fired upon by Marjorie Miller daughter of Sheriff Ed Miller. The outlaws overcome and are about to kidnap the girl when Gene Autry traveling with the medicine show owned by "Professor" Parker arrives and rescues the girl. Later Morgan calls a cattleman's meeting to get the quarantine lifted and has a fake veterinarian falsely testify that the fever is not contagious.But Gene and his musicians distracts the crowd and gives Gene a chance to show up the fake. Morgan tells Gene to get out of town by five o'clock but Gene tosses a bottle of medicine to Conners and shoots it out of his hand. The deadline is mentioned no more. Sheriff Miller and a deputy are shot from ambush. Gene takes the wounded Miller to a ranch and orders all to keep it a secret that Miller is alive. Morgan figuring the sheriff is dead orders a new election hoping to put one of his own men in office and lift the quarantine but Gene is pressed to run by the locals and wins. The desperate Morgan and Conners decide to run the cattle through anyway. Gene Frog and Gene's hands including the non-actress Audrey Davis/Art Davis ain't having none of that.
