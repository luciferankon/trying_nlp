The official video for Green Day's "Stray Heart" from the album Ä„Dos! (2012). The video tells the tale of a guy who buys some records for his girlfriend only for her to realize that his heart has strayed elsewhere literally. The guy's heart has its own tiny body and it goes around town trying to evade its owner leaving a trail of blood splatters and jilted lovers.
