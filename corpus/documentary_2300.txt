A reconstruction of the operating conditions and methods of Charing Cross Hospital in 1922. These are compared with modern (1972) practice in the new Charing Cross Hospital. Has an interesting take on the benefits and disbenefits of medical advances in the latter half of the 20th Century. Essentially the beginning of Brian Gibson's subsequent career in Drama.
