KAFFIR BOY is the true coming of age story of Johannes Mathabane who endured a childhood of squalor and destitution in the Alexandra Township for 18 years (1960-78) only to free himself in the most improbable way -- by being the first Black South African to receive an American tennis scholarship with the help of tennis legend Stan Smith. The story chronicles Johannes' journey from accepting his lot in life to steadfastly rejecting it through the gift of education and athletics.
