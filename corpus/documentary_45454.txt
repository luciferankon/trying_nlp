The untold story of how Sweden lost a world class art collection. Private art collector Theodor "Teto" Ahrenberg obtained art directly by artists like Picasso Chagall and Matisse. He became friends with the international artists elite. And therefore developed a conflict with the Swedish art establishment. The Director of the Modern museum Pontus Hult√©n became his nemesis. Revenge to Theodor Ahrenberg would be creating his own art museum of Stockholm. Designed by world-famous architect Le Corbusier. That dream was shattered when Ahrenbergs Secretary was stopped at Bromma airport with a little too much money in her purse. Fifty years later Theodor Ahrenbergs children and his widow can not forget or forgive that the Teto was humiliated and forced to kneel before the Swedish authorities.
