An improvised late '60's short-subject student film and debut movie of Director Charles Burnett; done in the neo-realist documentary film style. A day-in-the-life South Central L.A. tale about a rag-tag group of unemployed black male pals. The realistic dialogue and attitudes of the principal players will remind the viewer of latter day Spike Lee/ Ice Cube movies. The moving of the washing machine scene will remind one of the 'engine carrying' sequence' of Burnett's '77 "Killer of Sheep" Feature. Inspiring.
