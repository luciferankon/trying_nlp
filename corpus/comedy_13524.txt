Maja has a dream. She wants to be an actress. Unfortunately at the moment she's a waitress at the slightly old fashioned 'Cafe Central'. The show alternates between the world of the cafe where Maja works with the sexy (though intellectually challenged) bartender Odi; the practical punk waitress Paula; and the love-sick grumpy Boss; and the apartment Maja shares with her ex-babysitter the over-sexed Ariana. Along the way Maja finds the occasional acting role while falling in love with Mr. Cappuccino the mysterious Marc.
