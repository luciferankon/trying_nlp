ZULU meets JAZZ provides an opportunity to learn the history of Jazz music in the townships of Durban a link between the music and the social movement "a long walk toward freedom" which brought an end to Apartheid. The film also intends to recount the musical journey and the challenge faced by a few South African musicians who were forced into exile or fled their homeland where their human rights were denied. Thanks to the musician Paolo Fresu and the film-maker Ferdinando Vicentini Orgnani we live a very special trip into the South African music with the guide of KZN Vintage Legends Orchestra a group of over 20 Zulu musicians which includes Theo Bophela and Ndikho Xaba two very important figures in the South Africa scene both in their late seventies.
