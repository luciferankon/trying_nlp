Space Available is a character-driven web series set in one of NYC's shadier rehearsal studios. The world of Space Available is a microcosm of the city itself where struggling artists co-exist with studio employees and management as well as other patrons of questionable intentions. Conceived and written by Pasquale (Patrick) Avella and drawing on his personal experiences working in a rehearsal studio the series presents a realistic poignant and often humorous portrayal of the urban artistic struggle.
