A series of screen tests of young actors shot in their beds early in the morning. Aks asked each one of them to learn a monologue from a famous film/play that meant something to them and resonated with them personally so they could recite it from their beds as naturally as possible. The juxtaposition of a fragile morning human with no makeup on or anything else to hide behind and often a rather intense monologue creates a unique atmosphere in each short film. Selected pillow talks were compiled in one film and screened at the end of July in one of London's cinemas.
