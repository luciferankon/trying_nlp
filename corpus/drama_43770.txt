Petros is an archaeologist who experiences the naked Greek paranoia in the center of Athens. Either by choice or coincidence he comes into contact with people who are "different": An Arab immigrant who comes to Greece a land of "infidels" determined to conquer it by any means; A Greek-French cello player who is burdened by the agony of her alcoholic mother; A young Albanian pianist who carries the curse of his own personal genius and divinity; A Greek immigrant who was repatriated but now has nowhere to call home; A bank director who believes everything can be bought even love; A patrolman who creates his own version of socio-political reality. Petros' contact with these people is in fact a traumatic experience. For each encounter he has to pay a price. Sometimes the price is material while other times it's emotional. At times it is both. Will the experience gained make up for the loss?
