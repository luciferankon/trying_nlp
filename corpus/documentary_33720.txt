Lian Gogali and her 500 female students are a force to be reckoned with the conflict torn area of Poso Indonesia. They are part of a powerful and successful movement for peace and justice in an area that has been racked by inter-religious violence for over a decade. But five years ago Lian was just a single mother living in rural Poso with a broken leg and a big dream to educate marginalized women. The Peace Agency follows her remarkable journey from her village to New York City to create The Women's School an institution that transforms its all-female class into agents of peace and non-violence grassroots activism that has altered the course of the conflict in Poso and possibly the future of Indonesia.
