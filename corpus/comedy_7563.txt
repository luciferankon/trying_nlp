Three Keys girls quarrel over a hotel left by their uncle each claiming the property. Rose and May are very prim and put on all the airs of country belles while Teddy is a harem-scarem tomboy full of mischief and fun. Snaggs a designing old lawyer has the will of the uncle and he has just jilted Matilda Jenkins a wealthy widow because she lost her fortune and now plots to win the hand of one of the Keys girls and get the hotel. He tells the girls their uncle has left all his property to the one who shall be declared the homeliest by the first drummer who stops at the hotel. They all refuse to enter the contest Snaggs therefore makes love to Teddy trying to get her to consent to pose as the ugliest of the daughters. Grimes Teddy's suitor suspects Snaggs and urges the girls to get hold of the will. Rose and May disguise themselves as foreign women and go to the hotel in the hopes of discovering it. The widow is already there in man's attire hoping to get a chance to get revenge on Snaggs. Teddy dresses as a drummer and also takes a room at the hotel in order to put one over on Snaggs. Snaggs falls into her trap and bribes her to pick out the homeliest. In the meantime the two suitors of Rose and May have hired anarchists to blow up the safe and get the will. They put a bomb under the safe just when all the principals are arguing in the lobby. They get the will but Teddy grabs it and reads a clause which says the sisters can divide the property if they wish. Then ensues a battle in which all are more or less damaged disguises are torn off and the identities of all revealed.
