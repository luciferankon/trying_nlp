The matter of religion in politics was constitutionally settled with the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..." and more explicitly in regard to holding public office in Article VI paragraph 3: "...No religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States." Despite this 22% of Americans as of 2011 said they would not support a Mormon for president. This is the story of the uphill battle to overcome misconceptions about what a Mormon in the White House would mean for America.
