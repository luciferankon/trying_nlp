Award winning director Lindsay Anderson (If... O Lucky Man!) subverts the mockumentary genre and presents to the audience a detailed and humored account of what truly means to be Lindsay Anderson in his daily routine meeting with artists actors and regular people discussing what's going on in the world at the time. And of course there's plenty of time for him to discuss some of his passions: movies and theatre remembering of his time as a former film critic and stage director.
