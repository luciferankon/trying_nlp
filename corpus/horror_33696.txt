The show presented a double feature of horror movies. The show would commence at 8:00 pm. The opening sequence to the show had a dusty book with the title "Saturday Night at the Movies" which was on a table top. A candle cast a light onto the book. The stations logo which was a cube with "WVTV Milwaukee" on one face and "18" on another face was behind it. There was also a rope coiled to the left of the book. There was flashes of lightning which could be seen through a window and thunder claps could be heard. A tarantula crawled over the book while the voice announcer Bob Beringer introduced the film title. The spider was named Shirley named after the zoo keeper's wife Ken Schoenrock who it was on loan.
