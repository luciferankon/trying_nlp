This multi-platform documentary shows how gentrification is deeply rooted in a history of discriminatory laws and practices in the United States. City Rising follows the journey of California communities that are fighting gentrification and features a growing movement of advocates seeking responsible development across the state. People of color who cherish their neighborhood's culture and sense of community are mobilizing against unsustainable rents and other forces that they see are pushing neighbors into homelessness.
