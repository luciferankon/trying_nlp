In "Wait 'Til You Have Kids!!" three teams of married couples were asked questions about raising children and what they think the outcome of certain situations will be. After the couples chose what they thought was the correct answer a resident parenting expert explained the answers and eventually revealed the correct one. The couple who chose the answer that matched the expert's advice won and went on to the next round (there was a total of three rounds). The couple with the most points at the end of the third round went on to play a fourth bonus game.
