A cruise ship is an escape into unimaginable luxury a cocktail of high fashion hard bodies exotic locations - and more money jewelry and liquor per square foot than anywhere else on earth. It's a fantasy come true... until someone gets murdered at which time jurisdiction issues arise and crime scenes get contaminated; forensic analyses are practically nonexistent and cases turn cold when a ship reaches port and the passengers disembark for parts unknown. The clock ticks at the speed of the ship's propellers. It's a detective's nightmare. Meet Henry Grave a private investigator with a keen understanding of human nature an unremitting love of the cruising life and a suitcase full of idiosyncrasies. Is he an obnoxious old man romantic charmer kindly grandpa or unrepentant glutton? Nobody seems to know for sure. It's hard to tell if he's over the hill or standing on top of it. However we can count on this: Henry will eat and drink like a sailor woo every attractive woman who crosses his path and go toe to toe with anyone he suspects of harboring clues to the crime. He makes some people laugh and others squirm and when the time comes he won't hesitate to put a bullet where it belongs. A cruise ship is a floating paradise - unless you start trouble and Henry Grave is called aboard.
