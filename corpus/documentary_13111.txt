The events of May-June 1968 in France are almost 50 years behind us but the shadow of that historic period continues to loom large. The Odd Spring of May '68 tells the story of those days through the eyes of some of its most imperiled participants: the police CEOs politicians and Communists shaken awake from their revolutionary dream. Their testimonies are often funny sometimes frightening-and always riveting. We explore the complexities of memory as we follow the director his crew and close relations brought together for a day in the country. As the participants and witnesses review old photo archives political posters and film archives the film shifts points of view ultimately reshaping the opinions of the characters - and the audience.
