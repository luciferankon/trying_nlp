Guy doesn't like the post-modern world. He doesn't care much for post-modern love neither. He likes to read noir novels and practice trumpet. Maybe one day he can play Baker songs like only he did. He moves constantly from a city to another as an undercover agent taking part on an international conspiracy of little means that fights affective disenchantment with loving counterattacks. He doesn't like flying. He'd rather take the train.
