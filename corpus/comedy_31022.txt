It begins. The City. What was once a paradise has become a hell. The streets are now overrun by a most loathsome drug kingpin. Children are dying. A crime wave has infected the city like a virus. But for this virus there is no simple remedy. No quick fix. Only a vaccine. A vaccine in the form of a rogue detective. A detective that plays by his own rules. A detective named Mustang Ironheart. Those sworn to uphold the law respect him. Those who break the law fear him. They should. The first adaptation of Ekim Htiek's rare cult underground graphic novel series Preludes takes place during the Valiant City years of the saga as Mustang returns to town to find crime running rampant. Armed with an arsenal of martial arts moves and puns Ironheart uses his fists to knock crime out of Valiant City for good.
