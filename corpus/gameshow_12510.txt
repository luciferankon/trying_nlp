This was a game based on word knowledge. A word would be presented to a contestant and a panel of three celebrities. One panelist would have the actual definition written out on a card while the other two merely had cards with the word "Bluff" printed on them. Each panelist would give their version of the definition of the word and the contestant would have to determine who was correct and who was bluffing.
