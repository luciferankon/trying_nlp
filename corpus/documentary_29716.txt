Among the challenges the Calhouns were forced to chose between their congregation and their son. The third segment records the powerful reunion between two women who had parted under tragic circumstances years earlier. Now both mature women at the time of their first encounter Joanna Adams was a young minister and Kathryn Cartledge was a parishioner filled with self-loathing about her core identity. Decades later they explore together what went wrong in the first encounter telling a story that is both heart wrenching and healing. The final segment "Open Door" examines the wellbeing of a welcoming Presbyterian congregation and their members in Minneapolis Minnesota. In interviews and in worship members and leaders of the congregation express their insights and attitudes toward being a welcoming place for gay and lesbian Christians. In-between each segment deeply respected theologians Homer Ashby (McCormick) Walter Brueggemann (Columbia) Beverly Roberts Gaventa (Princeton) and Shirley Guthrie Jr. (Columbia) connect the stories to scripture and faith.
