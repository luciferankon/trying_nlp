Liebesfilm is an ironic attack on one of the durables of the Hollywood clich√©s - the film kiss. A short take of mouths approaching each other is shown 522 times. But the kiss never takes place merely the speed of the movement is continually increased. This excessive repetition of the theme destroys the "happy clarity" that inhabits "the film kiss" myth.
