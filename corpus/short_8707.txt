A marriage of intimate character drama and epic oceanic scenery 'Mermaid Homesick' is the haunting tale of a girl that washes ashore and the broken family that takes her in. We meet weary single father David his fantastical younger daughter Billie and her cynical older sister Sam. Their dysfunction is amplified by the nameless Girl who Billie declares simply must be a mermaid. Whilst Sam is distrustful of her David seems captivated and the dissonance between father and daughter intensifies. A morose pondering of love loneliness and trust 'Mermaid Homesick' premieres Sunday October 16 at The Howler in Brunswick.
