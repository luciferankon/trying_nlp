With ten films to his credit life for Patrick should be wonderful. A provocative question from a reporter at a wrap party causes Patrick to reflect on how far he has moved from what he originally aspired to be when he first wanted to direct films. The next morning Patrick wakes from a dream of how his 11th film would start. Freshly inspired he gets the development team together to explain the idea Both THE PRODUCER and THE SCREEN WRITER react badly to the idea. "When Life is as good as this  why change it?" is the only question THE PRODUCER has. Patrick decides to proceed regardless. Relationships are strained to the very point of breaking. There are those who will stop at nothing to get their own way. There are those who will do whatever they are asked to no matter who it hurts. There are those who try to stop the events unfolding before them Will Patrick withstand the forces mounting against him or will the 11th Cut be his last?
