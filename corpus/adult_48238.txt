Stripped down to dry his clothes by the fire talk veers from muscle-building at the gym to the well-endowed illustrator's sexual frustrations at not finding willing women who are his type. The wet friend helps him out. Story #2: Two cowboys play poker for matchsticks before horsing around with each other. Story #3: Two Foreign Legionnaires visit "the favorite" of an enemy king to ask him the favor of using his influence to end the fighting and bring piece to both sides but the king's favorite asks for "a favor" in return and then for the studly lieutenant to "give favor" to his startled captain. Story #4: A fireman discovers a young man asleep in his bedroom who's totally unaware he left the stove on that started a kitchen fire downstairs. Mutually overcome with desire the two whip out their hoses to alternately put out the spontaneous flames of passion now arising in the bedroom. Story #5: A lone Indian warrior finding a partially stripped cavalry man staked out for death carries him back to his cave to recover. When the unconscious soldier later wakens his curiosity towards his benefactor leads him to peak under his loincloth. The warrior awakens to appreciate his gratitude. Conclusion: Still at his desk the illustrator looks into the camera for the viewer to provide his next inspiration.
