Ali is a struggling Indian actor who can only get stereotypical roles but he thinks if he changes himself to what he perceives to be Hollywood "norms" he has a better chance of getting a role. When he finds out there are a lot of Jews in Hollywood he converts to Judaism. When he finds out there are a lot of gays in Hollywood he comes out to his parents and they try to arrange a gay marriage for him. Ultimately he learns that he should not have to change who he is but Hollywood should change its perceptions of people and he should change his perceptions of Hollywood.
