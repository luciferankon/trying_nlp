We follow Barbara through her morning preparations but she has bad habits; she doesn't wash her sweaters or her hair her room is a mess she doesn't have time for breakfast and she's late for school! Then she falls apart at a party; maybe she should take some tips from the more well-kempt Helen. All this time she is lambasted by a condescending narrator who makes you want to hit her.
