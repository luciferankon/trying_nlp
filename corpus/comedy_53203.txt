The lives of an on unorthodox film crew are detailed in this "30 Rock" style parody. Among the colorful characters are Jay Davis a foul mouth asshole who is the writer producer and star of the show; Black Jack Johnson an insubordinate unpredictable stuntman; Donte Diesel the stressed out under appreciated volatile director and cinematographer. Jennifer Lenius the manic depressive hot-head headed violent actress; Jato the semi-competent socially awkward actor. See what happens when Jay tries to bring his hilarious ideas to life with a non-existent budget and a dysfunctional cast and crew.
