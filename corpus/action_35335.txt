A diplomatic meeting between Western and Arab diplomats goes wrong and a black gold dossier is firmly pushed across a desk. Against a background of hostages taken in an embassy a covert operations agent Benson is given a mission in Paris. He is going into an Arab Emirate with a chosen group of operatives and blow up an oil refinery. Getting in is easy but getting out - well that's another thing. In the end among crossfire and grenades and double-crossing only Benson comes back to report mission accomplished. he will be gunned down by the Eiffel Tower by his own people. The mission was so secret that someone made sure "Dead can not speak."
