When Dream Worlds Collide is a fascinating funny and shocking tour through the many facets of the burgeoning cult of Disney escapism currently pervading the mainstream white-bread baby-boomer faction of our nation's society. From the "Furrie" phenomenon to rabid pin collecting to Disney theme park "annual pass holders" spending every day of their life at Disneyland we see not only the driving force of fear behind the irrationality but also how a disillusioned generation brought up with the "nuclear family" ideals of the fifties is beginning to turn its back on a frightening hostile world resembling nothing like the one promised in their youth choosing instead to purchase a more kinder and magical facsimile from Disney at a much steeper price than they realize.
