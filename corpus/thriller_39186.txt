While reporter Jon Edens is researching for a book about "shut-ins" he stumbles upon a curious woman named Adelaide. Her stern morally over-zealous upbringing within a cult-like communal group known only as "The Family" shaped her early years and has caused her to be emotionally undeveloped in relating to the outside world. Since that time she has been holed-up as a long-term renter at a distant off-road motel. It is there that obsession is sparked and dark secrets are illuminated. Secrets that she would die for - or kill to protect.
