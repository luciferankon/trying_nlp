Based around the stand-up routines of comedian Margaret Cho this series looked at the culture clashes that occured between a traditional Korean mother and her fully Americanized daughter. Mom just wants Margaret to marry 'respectable' men: doctors lawyers scientists (always Korean) while her daughter is more interested in white bikers musicians and any other type that her mother is bound to hate. Through all of this Dad knows better than to interfere and just keeps out of the fray.
