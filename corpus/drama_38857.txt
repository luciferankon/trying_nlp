Shiva (Hanieh Tavassoli) is the family head and looks after her little son Amir Ali; a witty and playful boy in the absence of her husband Behzad (Reza Attaran) who has committed a murder in a fight on a parking space with another man. Now he is in prison and waiting for his verdict. Amir Ali is a first grader and thinks his father is dead but after visiting him in the prison he gets depressed. Shiva visits the murdered man's brother-in-law everyday and asks him to talk to his family in order to get their approval to be paid the Blood money. The victim's twin sister is very persistent on doing the Equal retaliation and they can't get her satisfaction. Mr. Izadi (Shahrokh Foroutanian) the warden and his wife (Afsaneh Chehreh Azad) who is a social worker also try to help Behzad. Meanwhile the visits between Amir Ali and Behzad becomes more and more intimate after Behzad gives his son a wooden horse which he has made in prison. Behzad is a former English teacher and teaches one of the guards privately to make him ready for the entrance exams. Because of his good behavior Behzad gets a three day permission to go home. This out-of-prison visits improves Amir Ali's self-confidence and he becomes calmer and even his grades are better now. Finally Mr. Izadi takes Amir Ali to the victim's house where his mother is speechless for five years because of her son's death. Amir Ali apologizes for his father's action in a childish way and makes the mother cry. But we don't know whether her response is to forgive or to execute Behzad.
