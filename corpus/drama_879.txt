October 15 2010 - Following a 911 call a police car is dispatched at an isolated house near Franklin Pensylvania. Two battered young men are found in the house one of them half-dead. A third man is seen roaming about on the front lawn shell-shocked. Upon seeing the police officers he blurts out: "... we were just playing... we didn't know things would get out of hand... she... she just couldn't take it..." "She" is in fact a young lady invited over for dinner by one of the three young men. Unbeknownst to her their romantic evening was filmed by eleven cameras six of which were streaming live to the internet from 7:56 to 8:49 pm - that is until viewers' complaints led to the interruption of the live stream by the police. The Ultimate Pranx Case is an edited version in real time of an elaborate prank a carefully planned vicious case of bullying which went awfully awry. The film is made of footage retrieved from security cameras hidden handy-cams and a web-cam. By way of respect for the victims it is being presented without music and without sound or picture enhancement. The families of the young people involved have agreed to the release of the film to bring awareness to the dangers and often dire consequences of bullying.
