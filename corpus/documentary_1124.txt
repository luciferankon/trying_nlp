The Corrupt and the Dead is a feature-length documentary (approx. 90-minutes) by Tigre Hill about the Philadelphia Italian Black and Irish organized crime groups. Covering select events from 1903 to 2000 the film uses historical footage interviews and narration to tell the story of these groups' origins within Philadelphia differing methods of conducting business and reasons for decline. Distinguishing the documentary from other film depictions of the mafia The Corrupt and the Dead also interweaves Mr. Hill's assessment of the financial cost that the mafia has imposed on society including increased prices that consumers unknowingly bear as a result of organized crime. Noteworthy stories told during The Corrupt and the Dead include the beginnings in Sicily of the first Philadelphia mafia boss Salvatore Sabella how Sabella came to America to start the first Mafia family in South Philadelphia and the ways in which the Philadelphia mob was connected with the Five Families of New York City.
