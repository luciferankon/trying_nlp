Mick Jagger has teamed up with Eurythmics founder Dave Stewart soul singer Joss Stone Academy Award winning composer and global superstar A.R.Rahman and reggae star Damian "Jr Gong" Marley to form a cooperative project called SuperHeavy. This diverse and eclectic line up who share eleven Grammy Awards between them have been recording together in various studios around the world with the majority of the tracks on the project laid down over three weeks in Los Angeles earlier this year. Their self-titled debut album will be unveiled in September and tracks include the first single 'Miracle Worker' plus 'One Day One Night' 'Energy' 'Unbelievable' 'SuperHeavy' I Can't Take It No More' 'You're Never Gonna Change' and 'I Don't Mind.' It's little wonder that Stewart refers to SuperHeavy as "A mad alchemist type experiment". Fusing the talents of one of the greatest front-men of all time a two time Academy award winning Indian composer a soul vocal prodigy a three time Grammy winning reggae star and one of the most sought after producers in the world you would expect the explosive results to defy categorization.
