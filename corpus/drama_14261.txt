Aleksa Cloete (Sandra Prinsloo) a well-known Cape Town psychologist has authored a bestseller Love Doesn't Hurt but despite her long and happy marriage to husband Ben (Marius Weyers) she has an entirely intellectual view of love. Their only child Christiaan (Roelof Storm) was forced while growing up to find much needed nurturing from his 'second mother' loyal housekeeper Fy Abrahams (Shaleen Surtie-Richards). When Aleksa agrees to take part in a reality-style documentary about her breakthrough therapeutic work with women who confuse pain with love one of her patients Tanya Basson (Hilda Cronje) agrees to be the case study. Ben suffers a debilitating heart attack and Tanya arrives at Aleksa's home with the news that she has killed her boyfriend during a heated row. Aleksa realises that she has misjudged the severity of Tanya's emotional state and at the same time Ben tells her that he has reached a life-changing decision about the destiny of his own life. As the story unfolds Aleksa is forced to question her integrity and confront her ability to make sacrifices for the people she cares about. Ultimately she has to confront the question: "What would love do now?"
