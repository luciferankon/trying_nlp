Swaziland 2001. About 35 women and five children are found dead in the Malkerns forest. Their decomposing bodies can only be identified by the clothes lying near their remains. David Simelane confesses to the slayings and leads the police on a gruesome discovery of all the bodies. A trial follows but is dogged by controversy ill witnesses and even a suicide attempt by Simelane himself. It is by far the longest trial in Swazi history. It is rumoured Simelane is part of a syndicate that harvests body parts for money. Could that be the case or is Simelane just a sadistic cold blooded killer?
