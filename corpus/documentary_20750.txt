A South African news room braces itself to cover the biggest story of its existence - the death of the father of the nation. For many of the 35 young journalists working for eNCA this is the most memorable story of their careers involving heads of states royalty rock stars and celebrities. It is a week in which South Africa regains international currency but also a time of embarrassment for the bungles such as the posting of a schizophrenic criminal to interpret speeches in sign language at a significant memorial service. The story is shot as a behind-the-scenes account of the telling of the big story that gripped the world for more than a week.
