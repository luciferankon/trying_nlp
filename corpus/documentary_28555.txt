Most of us struggle with things that we cannot change such as the inevitability of death. We also struggle with things that we can change like finding a more meaningful job a happier relationship or dealing with ethical issues such as buying fair-trade clothes. To try and discover why we are this way author Claus Mikosch went on a journey. He travelled to four different countries and talked to eight very different people: A mother a school teacher a rapper a Buddhist a yoga teacher a clown an ex-banker turned sailor and a funeral celebrant. Anicca is a very personal honest and inspirational documentary about key issues regarding our struggle with change: fear courage trust and the big challenge of accepting reality as it is. The film takes a critical look at our tendency to cling to the familiar and shows that everything is impermanent that nothing ever stays the same.
