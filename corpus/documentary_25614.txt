A Glimpse of Heaven and A Taste of Hell has just won a Silver Remi Award at the WorldFest Houston International Film Festival! On July 21 2007 400 men and women from around the world participated in an ultra distance endurance run on the world famous Tahoe Rim Trail. Some opted for the 50K or 50 mile distance while others elected to run in the exhausting 100-Mile National Championship Event. This dramatic 56 minute television special chronicles both the story of ultra running and the colorful history of this event told by the participants and volunteers.
