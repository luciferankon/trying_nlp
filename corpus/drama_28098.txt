Longtime buddies Mitch and Danny are working-class guys in their 30s that life has slapped around ever since their glory days as high school jocks. But losing doesn't mean they see themselves as losers and while they lick their wounds every afternoon at a rundown neighborhood bar they still believe they're just one clutch hit away from getting back in the ballgame. The problem is that their lives become a cycle of idle talk half-baked plans and fear about the future. Mitch especially wants to act and is never at a loss for ideas about illegal shortcuts. Despite his bravado he is paralyzed by his lack of confidence. Danny has chosen the moral high road and a newfound faith in his own attempt to get on track. But his is the weaker personality and it's impossible for him not to get caught up in Mitch's schemes. Lucy is a naive idealistic young woman who is as broke as Mitch and Danny but who's spirit has not yet been broken by life's disappointments and failures. She has just arrived in town and doesn't intend to stay long. She has big vague plans for her future which she'll embark on as soon as she saves enough money to get to New York. Right now though her main concern is staying one step ahead of her unbalanced ex-boyfriend Tino. Mitch and Danny talk and plan and drink and simmer and grow increasingly desperate to make a change in their lives until finally Lucy becomes the catalyst they need to risk making a run for it. The odds of course are heavily against any good coming of it but the fact that they believe they're finally taking their destiny into their own hands is reason enough for them to feel victorious about whatever will follow.
