In between harvests to supplement their income Judith is sent by her father to catch birds which they would peddle come Sunday outside the church. On their trip to the city Judith requests that they watch a movie after selling off all the birds. What Judith gets in return is a hornpipe made out of rolled-up film negatives. The story is set in Bikol where it is a practice among rural folks to surround the perimeter of their farmlands with film negatives to ward off birds eating the newly sown rice seeds.
