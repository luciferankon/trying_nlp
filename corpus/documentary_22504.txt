For men it's something they get: 'I got some tail I got some action.' -- for women the first time is explained in terms of loss: 'I lost my virginity I lost my innocence;' documentary filmmakers Heather Maclean and Heidi Sackerson investigate the losers the women. Documentary filmmakers Heather Maclean and Heidi Sackerson set out to investigate the one event so memorable that no woman can ever erase it from her mind - their first time. It is said that every woman remembers her first time what is not said is how much it defines their view of sex and the opposite sex. After shooting over thirty women in the studio the filmmakers invited the women back to tell their stories in the location of the virginity loss. The stories didn't change but the emotions clearly did. What we found striking about the stories is how similar they are independent of race age and culture; it never ceased to amaze us how women of very differing backgrounds seem to live out the same tale. It's just the surroundings that change: the closet the motel 6 the Econoline van and yes even the bedroom. These stories do more than educate and entertain they make us relive the moment that none of us are truly prepared for.
