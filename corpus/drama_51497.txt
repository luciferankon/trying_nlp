A newlywed couple finds themselves in a predicament when on the first morning of their honeymoon Jaime new wife to Claude Dunphy is covered in bite marks and bruises. How did they get there? And how did the used condom in the toilet get there? They lounge in their French Quarter (of New Orleans) hotel room as they discuss the night before and how this may have happened and how it definitely did not happen...by way of Claude Dunphy. The war-torn groom a Vietnam soldier on leave can only negotiate with violence and booze and the bride's story of pure lust ignites their uneasy truce into flames.
