DORIS takes a spiritually subversive look at channeling prophesy and our current obsession with apocalyptic events warning the dangers of predicting the future. In this story about an unknown housewife living on the edge of the desert Doris Stiles involuntarily channels predictions of the end of the world and becomes an overnight media sensation. She opens her door to true believers and nut cases alike turning her dysfunctional family inside out for the whole world to see including an unscrupulous reporter who infiltrates her group and has the tragic secret of his life exposed by this gifted woman. Understanding channeling and other involuntary psychic experiences is what Doris struggles hard to integrate into her life as she walks a virtual tightrope of paranormal experiences in a difficult family situation surrounded by an environment of national and political chaos. This narrative shares her experiences with viewers by celebrating the awakening and evolving human consciousness we now seem to be experiencing worldwide. This metaphysical drama might ask us to sort through the Neptunian ambiguousness of the New Age world to seek the actual authentic higher nature of ourselves and to discriminate between that which is our true identity and that which is the comfortable clothing of a familiar delusion.
