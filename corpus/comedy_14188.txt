Crass satire and cutting commentary on topical New Zealand and International issues. You can probably count on one hand the number of viewers who have not been offended by at least one item on this programme. Believe nothing. The truth is not usually out here... With made up stories about native Maori porn movies being made using public money there seems to be no boundary of good taste over which the EML crew will not step. Eating Media Lunch is one of New Zealand longest running comedies - which is now preparing to enter its' sixth season. A highly acclaimed media satire in the vein of the Daily Show Eating Media Lunch bravely takes alternative views to mainstream media attitudes. As a result the material is invariably very funny and very controversial. The show is written by New Zealand's top comedy writers in Paul Casserly Jeremy Wells Steve Braunias Lee Baker and Claire Logan. This team has spawned the off shoot series the Unauthorised History of New Zealand which has also won plaudits and has completed two high rating series.
