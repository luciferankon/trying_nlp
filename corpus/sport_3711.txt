In PES 2017 the 1st touch is calculated by player attributes as well as the further inclusion of real ball physics directly controlled by the input ball touch. See how different players control the ball in unique and different ways based on where and how you control them dictating the flow of the game based on how they react to the unpredictable movement of the ball. In addition there is more control in how you receive passes and depending on the pass players can visually execute the exact play intended from receiving a pass to sending the ball out again.
