Four executives from top companies are lured into a virtual online game where the master creator (the founder of the game) entices them with challenges. He has a personal axe to grind with all of them as they have wronged him in the past. When their real lives start to mirror the game they realize not all as it what it seems. He can access every part of their lives and has access to pieces of technology he uses to snare and sabotage them. In the game he tempts them with the possibility of millions but his goal is really to destroy them and their companies and take them over as they are pitted against each other in a game of survival. His aim is to kill them all.
