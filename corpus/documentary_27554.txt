The first part is called "A Promise Fulfilled" and concerns war crimes committed during the Italian invasions of Ethiopia and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The second part is called "A Pledge Betrayed" and concerns the period after the Italian capitulation in 1943.

The section examining the Italian pro-Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia focuses on witnesses at the Rab concentration camp and atrocities in the Croatian village of Podhum near Rijeka. In the second part the emphasis is placed on American and especially British hypocrisy during this period.
