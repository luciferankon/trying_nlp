There is a myth of a bus that traveled every day from Skopje Macedonia to Belgrade Yugoslavia during the NATO bombing in 1999. A similar bus is depicted in Veta. There are no specifics to the story. It is the creator's response to the horrors that have haunted the Balkans for the past ten years. The film does not offer an answer or take sides it concentrates on the psychology of war and feeling of no exit.
