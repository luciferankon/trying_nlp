Standard story of the Phantom does have one major variation - The phantom is not a disfigured individual but rather is an unwashed orphan abandoned in the sewers under the Paris Opera & raised by rats. The Phantom invokes death upon anyone who dares harm his beloved rats. In fact The Phantom's nemesis is the chief exterminator who develops a rat-catching machine. In Paris 1877 rats save a baby from death and raise him in the underground of the Opera de Paris. This child becomes The Phantom of the Opera a half-human half-animal breed who falls in love with Christine Daa√© an opera singer just beginning her career. He fights for her love against the aristocratic Baron Raoul De Chagny though Christine loves them both equally.
