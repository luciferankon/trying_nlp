The Patricia J Show".was created as a place where the conversations are back to being real. A place where we will connect with ALL PEOPLE who have made a difference in Canadian society and in Canada's history. From heroes role models entrepreneurs and CEO's to celebrities musicians athletes inventors creators and even the girl-next-door. A place where we can share. An outlet of expression. A place where you as our viewer can chime in by leaving your comments below in the comments section. This is the beginning of a positive movement; one that I hope you will support and truly enjoy.
