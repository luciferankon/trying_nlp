Young Like Us is a web series about three ex-roommates who form a fake band in order to stay real friends. When Mia Ava and Charlie realize that post-college life is pulling them in very different directions they are forced to give up their shared Brooklyn apartment and maybe more. Charlie convinces her reluctant friends that the best way for them to hang out more is to become a girl band - because bands never break up right? Through the songs the girls (try to) write each week they are able to explore crises of sexuality identity and loneliness - combining a nostalgia for the past and an anxiety about the future.
