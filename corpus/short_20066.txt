In a fine and rather aesthetic example of early film colourisation on monochromatic black-and-white moving-picture images the Lumičre Brothers remake their original short movie "_Partie d'écarté (1896)_ (qv)" by placing their Cinématographe in front of a cheery group of four elegantly-dressed friends accompanied by an attractive and vibrant woman. During a gorgeously bright afternoon three of the gentlemen in their fashionable suits and hats enjoy themselves sitting around a small rickety table playing a game of cards al fresco while wine that is served by a maid is poured into the glasses by the female companion in the background. But who's winning the game?
