As kids in rural America Zachary and his older brother Gator loved making home versions of their favorite films most notably Jean-Claude Van Damme's karate opus Kickboxer and the notorious cult film Faces of Death. Then twenty years passed. Estranged from his family Zack returned to his childhood home to re-create these films shot for shot as precisely as possible--but now seen through a twenty-year lens of emotional and physical wear and tear. One brother became an actor and one self-destructed. Which is which? How different are these lives? Could this story have turned out the other way around? Maybe. And what are these peculiar parallels in Mr. Van Damme's life as it unfolded over the same twenty years? Born in Belgium or America the simple childhood desire for love gets confused with fame drugs & ambition. The liars believe their own lies and "real-life" clashes with the "art of manipulation." But with Mr. Van Damme and renowned pathologist Dr. Francis Gross in their corner Zack & Gator step into the ring one last time for a title shot at redemption. Initially begun as a film experiment the project morphed into a multimedia piece with live theatrical aspects and toured extensively through Europe Asia and NYC. These live aspects have now been recorded and incorporated into the film.
