The painting "Bubbles" shows a young child blowing bubbles. Painted by Sir John Millais and first exhibited in 1886 the painting subsequently became better known for its association with Pears Soap which made use of the painting in its advertising. Although the painting appears to show a happy scene the contents of the painting actually symbolises the fragility of human life. The soap bubbles themselves represent both the beauty and fragility of human life and the broken plant pot next to the girl is a symbol of death.
