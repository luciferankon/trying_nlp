The Cambridge icon Hugh Morgan Hill know as Brother Blue past away on November 3 2009 at the age of 88. Brother Blue dresses in blue from his socks to his beret to the butterflies painted on his palms. Brother Blue spends a lot of his time in prisons and on street corners. Why would you want to listen to Brother Blue? "I think I was anointed to be a storyteller-I mean touched by the fire" says Brother Blue. "I can tell stories in my sleep and blow the world away!"
