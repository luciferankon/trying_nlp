'Carey Wilson (I)' (qv) attends a party where he knows no one. Among those at the party is the young and gay Mary Dosier. But he learns from another guest that a year earlier Mary was in the deepest despair. This phase of her life started three years earlier. She had just gotten married to her husband the gifted but shy concert violinist and composer John Dosier. No one was happier for them than John's mother who gave them a year long vacation as a wedding gift. On their first anniversary in Venice John played for her "A Sonata to a Kiss" a composition he wrote dedicated to her and which has since become a worldwide sensation. The sound waves from that private performance shattered a champagne glass in their room which Mary felt to be an ominous sign. Indeed John was shortly thereafter stricken with an illness and died. Mary could not overcome her grief but an incident while she listened to a recording of "A Sonata to a Kiss" played by John may have saved her life and given her new perspective on it.
