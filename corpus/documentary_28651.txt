In a town in Texas called Williamson County an unusually high amount of families are watching their life's savings disappear into the vortex of family court. Meanwhile the reasons they entered the court system to begin with have not been resolved rather they have gotten significantly worse. In these cases children are involved. The children suffer often dramatically and are damaged through the prolonged court situations draining families of the very resources needed to support and care for them. Are the courts dragging out these situations on purpose for their own gain or are the family situations themselves so dramatically filled with deviant parents and dysfunctional families that they are what keeps these cases impossible to settle? This documentary examines these issues and puts a much needed spotlight on the issues of family court in Williamson County (Wilco for short) as well as in family court systems throughout the country.
