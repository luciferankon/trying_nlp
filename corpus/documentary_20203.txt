The idea of making a documentary about The World's Greatest Sinner appealed to me because I can almost wrap my hands around it. This film alone supplies a completed vision and enduring proof that honest cinematic self-expression is a rare event that needs to be celebrated. With this special focus it is my hope that the work-in-progress documentary Making Sinner sheds light on the visionary behind the film and portrays the crew around him - why they came the difficulties they faced and how they responded to the man behind it all. Abounding in remembered detail in anecdote and description it sets to expose the stubborn legends and partial truths about my father his work and his thoughts.
