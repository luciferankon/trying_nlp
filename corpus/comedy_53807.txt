Theatre kids are some of the most unique people you'll ever meet. It's basically an athletic team for the kids that don't do sports and love attention. Especially in the deep south these flamboyant or otherwise outcast set of young people need somewhere that will accept them. And that's what this theatre is. A set of outcast homeschool or otherwise exiled set of young adults looking for a place to go. These kids all have some sort of creative aspirations. The city they are in though has limited opportunity for that. This series follows this set of young adults as they pursue their passions or interests through the theatre. We watch them put on improv shows weekly to try to bring enough money into the theatre to pay rent. We watch them rehearse daily for both scripted and improvised shows. And finally we watch as their attention spans dwindle and really nothing ever gets done.
