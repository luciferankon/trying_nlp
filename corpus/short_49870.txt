'All Is Found' follows a quiet circuit-bending musician (Mickey) as he explores a demolished school in search of abandoned objects that he transforms into instruments. Among his reservoir of upcycled treasures and discarded children's toys Mickey experiments with electronica and performs an ethereal collection of music in his basement studio. This film belongs to a body of work produced under the umbrella of a project called 'Alchemy of Waste' (AOW). AOW is an immersive transmedia project that integrates upcycled materials into a collaborative storytelling experience. Human beings are the only creatures on this planet who produce useless output. Social mores of commercialism and materialism have maneuvered populations into a cycle of purchase dispose and forget. The AOW team is inspired by dumpster divers and tinkerers - eccentric characters who seem like hoarders but are in fact the underground pioneers of the upcycling movement. We personify these characters through an interactive multidisciplinary approach to an unveiling and deconstruction of collective perceptions of waste; thus redefining our relationship to trash and reshaping the audience's relationship to it.
