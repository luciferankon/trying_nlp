Moments after a monumental court victory two men make history outside of a Vancouver courthouse. They're the first same-sex couple to marry in British Columbia. Since then many others have said 'I do' with pride. Gay and lesbian marriages are out of the closet! In 2003 British Columbia became the second Canadian province to recognize same-sex marriage. Filmmaker Cal Garingan looks beyond the headlines and introduces the eight couples who challenged the law in court. Why did they plunge into a scorching debate that meant their lives would be publicly judged? What does it mean to them to exchange marriage vows? Against the backdrop of playful weddings and heated protests the couples ponder questions of love family faith and politics. Joy and Jane who come from previous marriages reflect on the significance of introducing each other as 'wife'. Bob and Lloyd ask if religious opposition means they must choose between God and their sexuality. Murray and Peter discuss why some people fear same-sex marriage while Dave and Shane fought simply to have the choice. Garingan deftly intercuts colourful footage with commentary from the couples their families and lawyer. The film also features acclaimed lesbian writer and activist Jane Rule - who disagrees with the focus on same-sex marriage rights - in a provocative conversation with some of the BC litigants. As controversy swirls around this issue worldwide Why Thee Wed? offers surprising and diverse perspectives on what it means for gay and lesbian couples to walk down the aisle.
