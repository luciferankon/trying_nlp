A team of dedicated scientists take on the historic conservation project of rebuilding the great American plains. More than 200 years ago the Great Plains were an American Serengeti. Since then human encroachment has slowly deteriorated the land and its wildlife. To rebuild an ecosystem on more than 3 million acres conservationists must track and reintroduce populations of iconic American species some on the brink of extinction. These include the bison the pallid sturgeon and prairie dog.
