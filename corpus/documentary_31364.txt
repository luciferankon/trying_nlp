Through the first person narration of costume designer Francine Lecoultre cultural promoter Claudia Durgnat musician Patrick Greppi and sculptor Andre' Kohler the documentary depicts a generation who had it all back at home but who nevertheless took the risk to leave Switzerland - a country usually considered an immigrant's dream destination but also a country too small for these artists' dreams. It is also an exciting visual exploration of the city of Los Angeles and of what makes it so appealing to artists and creators around the world.
