Current History gives us one day in the life of the Chiline family and others in the village of Beshencevo on the outskirts of Nizhny Novgorod in central Russia. Here we see the contrast between the fabric of the pre-Soviet village and the exhausted post-Soviet city. The present situation in Russia is neither stable nor predictable. We learn that each member of the family is adapting to the changes in different ways.
