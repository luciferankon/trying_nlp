A group of Spanish fans of the best British pop music from the late sixties owned an odd record store which only sold what they like. They decide to boycott the song "Lie lie" that will represent Spain in a contest called 'Mundocanal' (parody of the music festivals of the time as Eurovision). In order to accomplish the aforesaid they will put in practice several stratagems to avoid that the selected bands would participate in the festival whose performances will be happening throughout the film.
