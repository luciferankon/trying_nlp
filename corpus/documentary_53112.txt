In Wall Street Greed: Financial Crises Since 3500 BCE we discover the economic history of financial crises events that continue to occur and reoccur. Throughout history both rich and poor countries have muddled their way through a vast range of crises. These crises have included sovereign-government defaults on both domestic and foreign national debts banking and financial market panics and collapses due to piracy on the high seas and subprime mortgage meltdowns.
