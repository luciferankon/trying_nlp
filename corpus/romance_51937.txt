Prasanna (Kamal Haasan) is nursed back to health after a bloody fight by singer Bhairavi (Srividya). The two are slowly drawn to each other and they decide to marry inspite of their age gap and a past relationship she is still unextricably tied to. In the meantime Prasanna's father (Sundarrajan) embarks on a relationship with a younger girl Ranjini (Jayasudha). Both relationships are given a new twist by the addition of an unexpected new variable. A couple of daring concepts thrown in but too much of the standard tamil film melodrama and reliance on fabulous coincidences.
