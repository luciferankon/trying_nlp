Certain Women drops us into a handful of intersecting lives across Montana. A lawyer ('Laura Dern' (qv)) tries to defuse a hostage situation and calm her disgruntled client ('Jared Harris (I)' (qv)) who feels slighted by a workers' compensation settlement. A married couple ('Michelle Williams (I)' (qv) and 'James Le Gros' (qv)) breaks ground on a new home but exposes marital fissures when they try to persuade an elderly man to sell his stockpile of sandstone. A ranch hand ('Lily Gladstone' (qv)) forms an attachment to a young lawyer ('Kristen Stewart (I)' (qv)) who inadvertently finds herself teaching a twice-weekly adult education class four hours from her home.
