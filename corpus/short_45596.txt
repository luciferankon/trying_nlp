On a busy New York City street with an elevated line in view push-cart vendors are selling their wares in the street by the curb as horse-drawn carriages are having a difficult time getting through. A policeman shakes his fist at one selling fruits and vegetables and the vendor moves away. In certain sections of New York City large numbers of Jewish and Italian push-cart vendors congregate so closely along the sidewalks that they interfere with traffic. Policemen keep them moving. The picture shows how the frightened peddlers hurry away when a bluecoat appears. Some of the carts are piled high with fruits of all kinds and it is interesting and amusing to see the expressions of combined fear and anxiety on the faces of the men as they hurry away; the fear of being arrested if they stand and of losing some of their wares if the carts strike an obstruction in the street. Very fine photographically.
