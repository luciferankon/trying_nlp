An impressionistic short film largely inspired by Andrew Wyeth's paintings "Christina's World" and "Helga" LEFT centers around the heartbreaking separation between a woman and the man she loves. Devoid of dialogue this haunting and operatic film poetically reveals the grief of a woman trapped by the memory of her husband's departure in the midst of windswept grasslands.
