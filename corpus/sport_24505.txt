CAWL TO ARMS is a brand new unique action-packed adrenaline-inducing Co-Ed sport in which teams of students from rival schools around the country face one another in exciting and grueling matches to find the most powerful male and female collegiate arm wrestlers in America! The winning team will be named the inaugural 2014 CAWL TO ARMS GRAND CHAMPIONS...and split $10000 in cash! Throughout the competition team members' classmates will be on the sidelines screaming for their favorite students as they pump up intensity levels to extreme proportions. Long-held rivalries will reignite and school spirit will be abundant...getting each student's competitive juices flowing to the max during all of the explosive action! This one-of-a-kind hard-hitting College Arm Wrestling show will feature four teams with four members on each team (2 males and 2 females) as they go head-to-head (and arm-to-arm) with team members from rival schools. Each of the teams will be a part of the new College Arm Wrestling League (also known as the new CAWL). The CAWL will crown a new winning team on an annual basis. The inaugural season will consist of 3 episodes...the first two episodes will be the preliminary rounds and Episode 3 will be the FINALS!
