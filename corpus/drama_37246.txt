Reunited is an ensemble drama that shows the turbulent truth behind the idyllic facade of life in a small Midwestern college town. We follow several characters whose lives are ruled by their pasts-a girl struggling to support herself as she tries to break the cycle of abuse; a star football player whose bad behavior is the result of a lifelong grudge; a professor growing less content with her marriage; among others-until one violent night when they all collide and the consequences can be put off no longer.
