Five cops work and get on each other's nerves during a hot summer. Tak is a gambler too much so for his girlfriend to risk marriage. Daddy a single father is harsh with his son who reminds him of the woman who abandoned them. Monk is mercurial talkative a show-off. Kong a steady family man keeps the peace. Sam is new hoping to fit in and make it as a cop. Three brutal and murderous robbers are on the loose and so is a former soldier embittered over the loss of his pension using very real bombs to extort what's due him. It's a dangerous job and the cops must watch each other's back regardless of their personal problems.
