It's an idea inspired by Pope John Paul II. "Be the saints of the new millennium" he told us. But before we can be saints we need to know the saints. And so it began: a pilgrimage through Germany and Italy with almost 100 Canadian university students with visits in the towns homes and places of prayer of some of the saints of the Catholic Church. And the more we travelled the more clear the picture became - there is a resemblance between holy lives lived and lives living for the holy. Share in the lives of the young people who meet Saints and Blesseds in a new and very personal way in new Salt and Light Television film documentary. Filmed on location in Cologne Munich (Germany) and Pollone Mesero Assisi (Italy)and Vatican City in August 2005. Discover the stories of Sts. Peter Francis and Clare of Assisi Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (Edith Stein) Gianna Beretta Molla and Blesseds Rupert Mayer Pier Giorgio Frassati and John XXIII and let your heart be opened to the possibility of becoming a saint of the new millennium. This documentary was made possible by a special grant to Salt and Light Catholic Television Network from the Knights of Columbus.
