On March 18 1978 an estimated crowd of 250000 gathered at Ontario Motor Speedway to witness an all day festival bringing together nine of the most popular hard rock acts at the time. They ranged from established hard rockers such as Aerosmith and Ted Nugent the Latin sounds of Santana and up and coming acts in the form of Heart Foreigner and Rubicon. This special is a condensed sampling of the events that occurred that day and not only shows many of the performers at their peak but how the crowds were entertained between acts with skydivers as well as skateboarders performing on a very primitive half-pipe. Huge Rock Concert with an estimated 250000 people in attendance and featuring rock performers such as: Aerosmith Ted Nugent Foreigner Rubicon Heart Santana Dave Mason & Bob Welch. Was shot live at the event and later broadcast as two ABC-TV specials.
