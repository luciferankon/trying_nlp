In the year 1990 Brad a video game/comic book nerd and aspiring filmmaker moves in with his best friend Conor. Together they bond over their mutual love of video games movies and comic book characters and share important events in each other's lives as well as support each other during the tough times. Conor has somehow managed to hook a great girl in Kaity (an aspiring chef) who not only appreciates her boyfriend's nerdy obsession but encourages them. The trio is frequently visited by Brad's "platonic life partner" Veronica. Veronica is a lesbian with no mouth filter and doesn't care who she offends and tells it like it is which is refreshing to most. The one thing they all agree on is their mutual love for all the things that made the 90s such a decade of nostalgia and that slacker Jared is super annoying and won't go away.
