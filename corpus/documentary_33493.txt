If you could see everything for the first time again what would you see? Would it be different from how you look at the world right now? What do you think you see? You know what the color red looks like or a house or a bird. But do you really see it? Are you capable to wonder or doubt about what you see? After documentary film director Tamara Miranda gave birth to her first son Djamilo she looked with his 'new eyes' at the world and realized she lost this wonder a long time ago. It's not the great perspectives but the small and intimate worlds that we tend to neglect that are revealed and celebrated in this film.
