Prospectors Bill Carter (Bill Cody) and his young partner Ted Simms (Bill Cody Jr.) come upon the wounded Sheriff Madden (Edward Cassidy). left for dead by smuggling outlaws. They take him to the cabin of Desert Lew (Milburn Morante) where Madden appoints Bill a deputy to run down the smugglers. The leader of the smugglers is Hal Bost (Roger Williams) a Madden deputy who leads Diane (Betty Mack) to believe that Bill has killed her missing father. Bill and young partner Ted find the Sheriff on the desert. With the outlaws thinking him dead he deputizes Bill to take over his search for smugglers. A broken horseshoe leads them to Bost and when Bill follows him he finds a message he left for his men. Bill thinks this will let them round up the gang.
