A comedy about a modern family. When Inge's father died leaving them with nothing her mother Sophie moved in with her. And her son-in-law Paul and her grandchild Gwen. But then Inge moved out to live with Roel her new lover. So Paul finds himself living with his ex-mother in law. Adding to his misery his daughter Gwen took her first boyfriend Thomas to live with her after another row with his parents. Paul being the worlds kindest father (on a good day) naturally had no objections. Or rather he has them but nobody intends on hearing them because they are "verkeerd verbonden" meaning: wrongly connected.
