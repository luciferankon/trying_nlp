Directed by French author Geroges Perec "Les Lieux d'une fugue" is an autobiographical account of the writer's experience of running away from his aunt's house at age 12. As much a meditation on the streets of Paris as it is personal narrative. "Les Lieux d'une fugue" examines how Perec's verbal games play out alongside a film camera.
