The story revolves around the lives of a group of international fashion models focusing on the main character Fabrice. The film examines the hollowness of his glamorous lifestyle leading to self discovery and ultimately a personal catharsis (and his own death). The film is based on (really inspired by) the French Book L'Education Sentimentale by Gustave Flaubert.
