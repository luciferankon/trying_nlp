In this dark and dangerous Film Noir-metts-German Expressionism directorial debut from veteran visual effects man Les bernstien paunchy ex-con Joe Butcher (John Voldstad of THE NEWHART SHOW) heads south of the border tumbling head first into the boiling vat of corruption that supports Tijuana's thriving snuff film industry. Through a booze-induced haze Butcher encounters a Mexican spitfire a grizzled drunk a villainous dwarf and an obese sexpot as he frantically retraces his brother's final steps through seed and grime to unravel his mysterious death. Lavishly shot in black and white with great visual stylization NIGHT TRAIN is "... the most boldly evoked vision imaginable of Tijuana as hell-on-earth... unique and compelling." (The Los Angeles Times) NIGHT TRAIN is a must-see for fans of gritty motion pictures like MURDER IS MY BEAT KISS ME DEADLY and BLOOD FEAST."
