Mental a film by Slamdance award winning screenwriter Tom Russell served as the genesis for the 2006 feature film "Mr. Dungbeetle". It tells the story of Doctor Jay Stackhouse - a board-appointed psychiatrist striving to reclaim five mental patients led by a charismatic schizophrenic named Phillip. Doctor Stackhouse's task is complicated by the patients' shared delusion that they have been chosen to protect the sovereign shores of the United States from drug smugglers. Doctor Stackhouse soon realizes that the enemy is none other than his own colleague - the institution's senior psychiatrist who fundamentally disagrees with Doctor Stackhouse's approach. Training along side his fellow soldiers while shielding them from the deceptive efforts of the senior psychiatrist Doctor Stackhouse must ultimately confront his own concepts of allegiance freedom and reality.
