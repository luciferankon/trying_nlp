'Inspire Me! Africa' takes audiences on a journey with 28 American teachers as they travel through the heart of Africa's Serengeti with its dramatic biological diversity to Maasai villages Tanzanian schools and AIDS orphanages and as they trek to the giant volcano Mount Kilimanjaro fighting altitude sickness on their way to the summit. The film focuses on four educators and follows them back into their classrooms to explore how their life-changing experiences in Africa translate into inspiration for their students. Rookie teacher Sarah finds inspiration through experiential learning and serving as a true role model to her female students. Cody moves her students to engage in making a difference in the world through service learning projects inspired by her personal experiences in Africa. And music teacher John powerfully communicates his experience with an original musical created with his student choir and featuring the characters and melodies he encounters in Africa. Finally Leslie's hopes for the future are tragically cut short in a deadly car accident four months after her return from Africa - -reminding us all how precious life is and how our experiences and relationships are all we truly own. The film includes Dr. Jane Goodall and is set within the context of the enormous challenges and blame currently befalling American schools. It is both a much needed shot in the arm for teachers desperately seeking renewed hope and optimism and a powerful call to action to change traditional education as we know it towards more meaningful learning experiences.
