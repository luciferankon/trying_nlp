An updated version of the classic game show from the 60's and 70s'. Host Bob Hilton would choose contestants from the audience based on how outlandishly they dressed and how insane they acted. These contestants were then given cash or prizes which they could then choose to keep or trade away for hidden mystery gifts. Sometimes the prize would be something valuable but other times it would even less than worthless.
