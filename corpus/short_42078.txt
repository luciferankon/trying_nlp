When Alda's husband dies on a long distance fishing sloop she is in a great sorrow. An empty coffin is buried while Bogi is resting on the bottom of the sea. Her love for the sea becomes more apprehensive though her desire to leave the country grows stronger. ALDA is a short film with inspirations from paintings by SÃ¡mal Joensen-Mikines. With the combination of high contrast dark colour tones and a high grain 35mm film stock the intention is to create a cinematography style close to the look of paintings.
