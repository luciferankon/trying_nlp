Scotland Yard Commander Clare Blake is called back from holiday to investigate the apparent murder of Father Thomas Martin who was stabbed 29 times in his church. He was well respected in the community and had been instrumental in calming the local community after serious rioting some 5 years before. Thugs - reformed or otherwise -constantly surrounded him as he also ran a drop in center and a boxing club. There are rumors of child abuse as Father Thomas seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time with children. The police initially focus on Denny Wade an ex-con who had stabbed his wife over 50 times but the solution is found in events that occurred before the riots even took place.
