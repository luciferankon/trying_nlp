Coming from an upper-middle class background with a good education close friends and family members (she has one adolescent daughter) 37 year old Canadian Lisa seemed to be the least likely person to get caught up in the dangerous and self-destructive world of crack addiction and prostitution (which is how she funds her habit). She discusses in a very honest open and articulate manner here in the film's intimate setting (her Toronto hotel room to be precise) just what led her down this tragic path that she currently finds herself in and how she ultimately wants nothing more than to reach full sobriety someday so as to not only return to some semblance of a normal life as a mother daughter and friend but to hopefully educate and help others specifically women who have found themselves in a similar situation as hers.
