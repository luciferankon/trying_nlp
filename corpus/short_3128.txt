A man working as a street performing clown tries to attract the attention of passersby. As no one seems interested in his performance the clown for the first time notices his own shadow. He interacts with the shadow but its darkness scares him. He tries to get away from the shadow but everywhere he goes the shadow is not far behind. It isn't until he learns to deal with the shadow that he can again be in peace.
