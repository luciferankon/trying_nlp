This is the story of the famous dublin born 19th Century sculptor John Henry Foley. His most famous work is the Daniel O'Connell Monument in Dublin. He went against the grain with his fellow Irish men and undertook projects with like the Albert Memorial Hall in London and a host of Imperialist works in India. Foley's art suffered because of his association with the empire in particular after Ireland and India gained their independence. His equestrian statue of Lord Gough in the Phoenix Park was attacked several times by republican activists and was eventually restored and smuggled out to Britain. This is a story that examines the question of what do we do with art that no longer reflects the political attitudes of our day.
