An inner view of the 2002 presidential campaign of 'Lionel Jospin' (qv) filmed at "L'Atelier" his campaign headquarters in central Paris with some excerpts of his electoral meetings. Here we can see how 'Lionel Jospin' (qv) has prepared his electoral campaign with French Socialist Party leaders and how it has evolved during the 6 weeks of his campaign. No comments from the journalists are done. Although it doesn't explain completely Jospin's result it shows some indications of the inefficiency of the Socialist organisation some mistakes made by Jospin the heaviness of the campaign commitee in which it was difficult to draw a clear direction and to create a good climate for preparing this election. The film ends with the final unexpected failure of 21st April 2002 where Jospin was eliminated from the second round of the election arriving only in 3rd position defeated by 'Jacques Chirac (I)' (qv) and 'Jean-Marie Le Pen' (qv) and therefore announcing his retirement from politics. Surprise shock disbelief and sadness prevailed that evening in the Socialist headquarters.
