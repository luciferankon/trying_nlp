The picture opens with children playing soldiers. Boys and girls are in line and one of the little soldiers bravely defends the flag. We next see the cadets at the military school in drills. Boys and girls have grown up. The play has become serious. The soldiers are marching away. The next generation is the Grand Army man. Grandfather the Grand Army man is visited by his sons one of which is in the army the other one a naval cadet and by his grandchildren who also have donned military uniforms. The picture finishes with the North and South joining hands. Columbia laying a laurel wreath on both of them. Between them the American shield with the word PAX meaning peace.
