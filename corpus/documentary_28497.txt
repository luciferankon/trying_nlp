This is the question posed by Masha Shpolberg's film Orange Hangover which examines the after effects of the 2005 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. Shot in the culturally diverse city of Odessa on the eve of the 2010 elections the film follows the director's personal quest to understand the issues at stake and the potential paths to recovery.
