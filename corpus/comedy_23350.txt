This is a movie about a fictional pimp's journey towards redemption and the real life struggles to create the film. Documentary footage of the cast and crew whom also double as characters is woven throughout the movie as archetypal images and alter egos. The director's struggle to achieve his dream is a battle with the chaos of movie making. This battle mirrors the fictional narrative and blurs the line between what is real and what is not. Art creates the artist as the artist creates art. This is The Process.
