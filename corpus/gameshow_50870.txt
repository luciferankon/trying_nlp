Family Feud was one of the most popular game shows on TV but after nine years with Richard Dawson as host ratings were starting to slip. In 1986 producers decided that the "Family Feud" needed a makeover and they wanted a fresh face to breathe new life into this old favorite. "Family Feud" producer Howard Felsher remembered hearing great things about a talented young comic named Ray Combs. The late Mark Goodson chose Ray to host "The New Family Feud." It was a perfect match. Ray's down-home love for people was genuine. But pressures began to amount in 1994 as ratings on "Family Feud" began to slide following the death of Mark Goodson. Son Jonathan Goodson and consultant Harris Kattleman decided to bring back original host Richard Dawson to try and boost ratings but a drab set covering low prize money and bad timeslots forced "Family Feud" back onto the shelf in 1995. A newer edition of the classic game show on CBS. The show was 1st hosted by Ray Combs but he was later replaced by original host Richard Dawson. The format of the show remained the same with 2 families competing against each other by naming the most popular answer (No. 1) to various survey questions. Now The 1st Family collected $300 wins the game and play "Fast Money" for $5000 ($10000 in the new syndicated portion). From 1989 to 1992 "FAMILY FEUD" present "The Winner Take All Jackpot Tournament" where 4 wealthy families to play an 2 out of 3 match to determine to collect $400 wins the game and later wins the match play for $25000 on CBS-TV ($50000 on syndicated) to face another wealthy family and added $5000 ($10000) after a win in "Fast Money" that'll go up to $55000 ($110000). Later in 1990 it changed into months of "The Tournament" from $25000 to $35000 ($50000 to $70000). On June 29-July 3 1992 "THE ALL-NEW FAMILY FEUD" became "THE NEW FAMILY FEUD CHALLENGE featuring BULLSEYE" in order to boost the ratings... The 2 Families had a bankroll of $2500 & $5000 (also 1 on syndicated) by hitting the "BULLSEYE" with 1 survey question having 2 chances to hit the "BULLSEYE" before having 2 misses on these values are $500 ($1000) $1000 ($2000) $1500 ($3000) $2000 ($4000) & $2500 ($5000) to be increased up to a possible $10000 & $20000 in "Fast Money" after scoring up to 300 points and in the survey questions will added a point to the bank and collect the points to 1 of the 2 families. In 1994-1995 Richard Dawson came back to "The FAMILY FEUD" returned and "BANKROLL" replaced "BULLSEYE" and now the same starting bankrolls are $2500 & $5000 and the values are $500 $1500 & $2500 in Part 1 & $1000 $3000 & $5000 in Part 2 for the possible total of $7000 & $14000.
