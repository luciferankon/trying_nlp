In WITNESS TO HIROSHIMA Japanese citizen Keiji Tsuchiya using 12 watercolors he painted in 2001 recounts his experiences in Hiroshima as a 17-year-old soldier hours after the Atom Bomb blast. Through the use of animated still photographs and Mr. Tsuchiya's narrative the film depicts the horrors Tsuchiya witnessed and the aid he and others offered to the burned and dying victims they encountered. Out of such horror the film segues into the beautiful story of how and why Mr. Tsuchiya came to devote his life to preserving the life of the horseshoe crab.
