The hard-working old blacksmith is seen in his little shop toiling: making a living for himself and his good wife. Suddenly there is a transformation scene and a singular looking person stands before him. The amazed smithy listens to the interesting tales of the stranger and after a little persuasion the old fellow volunteers to accompany his guest who turns out to be none other than old Satan. The latter lures his victim into a cave where after many narrow escapes from falling into the abyss they finally arrive in Hades. Old Satan begins at once to make things interesting for his new guest and with the aid of numerous transformation scenes the frightened smithy is shown all the inside secrets of the infernal regions. When the smithy's wife misses him she at once starts out to find her husband and coming to the entrance of the cave she plucks up her courage and enters. Soon she is in the midst of all the fire and brimstone but when she spies her loved one she makes a frantic rush to rescue him from the throes of his satanic majesty. Things are beginning to look rather despairing for the smithy and his wife when suddenly the good fairy queen appears upon the scene bringing peace and happiness to the frightened couple releasing them from bondage and driving old Satan away.
