In the villages of Gujarat India many citizens lack access to education and healthcare. The most subjugated of these citizens are disabled children and young people who live in the poorest neighborhoods of the village and are not given opportunities to attend schooling due to their disabilities and social status. Rina Patel the founder and director of Aahana visits annually to check the status of the Mamta School a school she and the Human Research Foundation have partnered together to create. The Mamta School currently enrolls 67 disabled children and women between the ages of 5 and 19 to provide them with education healthcare and vocational training. In providing these opportunities to these children and women Aahana aims to transform society's perspective.
