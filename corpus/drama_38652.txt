Jackie is an average young woman living an average life in the suburbs when she meets handsome Nasir and it's love at first sight. They get married and baby Sasha is born. Over a period of time Jackie realises the man she married is not the tall dark knight sent to rescue her from a life of drudgery rather he is the jailer to a life of violence and abuse. As Sasha goes from baby to child then child to young adult her exposure to domestic violence moulds her and skews her moral compass. The bond between mother and daughter grows ever stronger and Jackie will stop at nothing to protect her daughter regardless of the outcome.
