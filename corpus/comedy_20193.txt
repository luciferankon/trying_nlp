At Lynbrook Academy the only ones worse than the students are the teachers... the Substitute teachers. The Subs sole purpose at Lynbrook are to log the minimum 12 teaching hours per week required for them to be eligible to coach sports. Former star athletes and Lynbrook legends these dysfunctional and unorthodox Substitute teachers roam the halls reliving their glory days all the while instilling proper values in their students. Sort of.
