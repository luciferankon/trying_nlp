For over a hundred years on the 4th of July runners have dared cliffs scree fields and waterfalls in a race up and down the 3022ft of Mt. Marathon. Set in the stunning coastal town Seward Alaska the Mt. Marathon foot race draws crowds of 40000 annually to watch America's most dangerous 5k race. In 2014 a stay at home mom challenged an Olympic skier for the women's title the men's record holder fought to retain his title in a field of hungry professionals and a former junior champion searched for a second chance after struggling with injury and drug addiction. Guiding us through the race is our lovable Man of the Mountain Flip Foldager a Seward native and a 35 time race finisher. Intimate interviews with all the top athletes reveal an inspiring story about running community personal strength and a race you'll have to see to believe.
