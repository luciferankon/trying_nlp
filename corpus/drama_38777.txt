Yuniol Perez (Shalim Ortiz) and Alberto "Junior" Rios (Frank Perozo) come from opposite sides of the tracks in the Dominican Republic. Aloof and detached Alberto comes from a wealthy family. Driven and focused Juan is reared by a devoted mother whose affection makes up for the absence of his father. Juan and his mother survive in a tough and impoverished Barrio on the outskirts of the capital city.
