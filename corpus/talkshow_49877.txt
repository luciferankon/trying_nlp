We want to bring you the most personalized news show you'll ever know. How personal is it? Well it's your actual Facebook friends who make the news. We turn your Facebook newsfeed into an entertaining video and add relevance by displaying the most "liked" postings first. We currently include your friend's upcoming birthdays most popular shared photos and the top rated status of the day. We also provide our Status Update Ticker which streams your friends' status updates along the bottom of the screen throughout the episode. The MycroNews channel and technology is already in place to do this but it's the entertaining content we need your help to build. We'll add life to your Facebook news by giving you top talented hosts mixing in pop media like movie reviews and celebrity gossip and bringing you the top songs of the week and latest trending Vine and YouTube videos. Our goal is to allow you to stop scrolling and start watching! See for yourself with your own friends by going to watch.mycronews.com.
