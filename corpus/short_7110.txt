A montage piece that truly looks at a post-apocalyptic world 5 billion years into the future when our Sun will become a Red Giant. The very instant this enlargement starts to occur not a single creature from Earth could possibly witness this live as the speed it takes light to reach Earth from there is approximately 8 minutes. Whether humans have a good chance to survive or not shows how by Darwinian example we must all lead through survival of the fittest as well as progress forward even further with scientific advancements and human rights movements. We all take part in making it - or else.
