Three young guys prepare a theatrical performance based on Luigi Pirandello's masterpiece "Six Characters in Search of an Author". While they are rehearsing fiction oozes into reality. Chiara discovers her boyfriend is actually married; Gianmarco is engaged with a girl dreaming he'd be different from how he is; Luca works desperately as a waiter to support the play. And like in an absurdist metatheatrical show their lives influence the way they act.
