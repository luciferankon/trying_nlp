A colorful whimsy of an animated poem produced designed and animated by Little Fluffy Clouds for the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Created in a painterly style the animation evokes the watercolor paintings of artists J.M.W. Turner and John Singer Sargent. The piece is nestled within a colorful dreamy richly textured pre-WWII Europe illustrating a host of working men and women - porters bakers millers farmers dockers waiters and more - going about their daily life. The poem written and narrated by economist educator and Hoover Fellow Russ Roberts explores the seemingly magical ways that we anticipate the needs of others without anyone actually orchestrating things. Primarily devised as a teaching tool the animated video is partnered with a website that encourages economics students and teachers alike to delve deeper into the ideas of Roberts' economic doctrine. The original score which fits the animation like a silk glove was penned by the talented duo at pop Tuna Monica Pasqual and BZ Lewis. The 60-second teaser has its own variation on the original theme. Little Fluffy Clouds produced designed and animated three versions: a 60-second teaser the full seven-minute version and the same with on-screen text animation.
