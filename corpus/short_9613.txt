In this documentary Damo reflects on past and present with touching honesty. Try reconciling the image of a well-heeled gent confidently addressing a delegation of State politicians and dignitaries on housing and related issues with the image of a heroin user street-wise and homeless for ten years!...and you get the gist of Damo's remarkable tale. It's a tribute to our dynamic human capacity for re-invention and is a subtle challenge to mainstream representations of heroin and its dependents.
