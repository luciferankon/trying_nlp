HELLO EVERYBODY. Now then as some of you might know I was made to go off round the country this year and do a show to loads of people. I went everywhere up north down south and I even had to go to Scotland. If I'd have had my way I wouldn't have gone I'd have stayed at home with my feet up watching Dragons Den with a box of Magnums. So in the end what happened was I got to this one place in Digbeth and they've got a load of video cameras there and they say right we're gonna film this. So they did and this is what you've got the video of it so have a look at it and see what you think.
