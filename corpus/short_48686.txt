Auto Da FÃ© (2016) or Acts Of Faith is a diptych that looks at migration through the lens of religious persecution and continues Akomfrah's longstanding interest in the transmutations brought about by relocation. Presented as a lyrical period drama the film lays bare colonial and post-colonial experience through its documentation of eight historical migrations over the last 400 years.
