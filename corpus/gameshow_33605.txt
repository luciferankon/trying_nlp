Two contestants competed in this short-lived syndicated game show of puns and rebuses. A toss-up puzzle (aka the "Catch Phrase") was drawn; the first to guess the puzzle revealed one piece of a "Super Catch Phrase" puzzle either a rebus or pun. The contestant may either guess the puzzle or play another toss-up. Each toss-up added cash (either $50 or $100) to a pot and the contestant who guessed the "Super Catch Phrase" won the pot. The contestant who had the most cash after time expired was champion and played the bonus round. In the bonus round the contestant faced a board of 25 lettered squares each containing its own Catch Phrase-style rebus or pun. The contestant won $200 per correct guess and getting five squares in a row (either up down or diagonally) won a bonus prize package with the best prize packages for those who complete a diagonal row.
