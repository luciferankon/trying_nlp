Annie Abigail Allen is a girl who lives in her own world where other people just pass through. She's a film snob but not your typical one. While she digs on things like Czechoslovakian cinema and Cabinet of Dr. Caligari she also thinks The Asylum makes the best bad movies ever and is a horror movie buff. She's a cute yet complicated girl with a very bohemian fashion style and tends to dress in flowy stuff.
