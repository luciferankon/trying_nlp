We are two women who have each grown in our own Grandmother's country. We have some knowledge and insights to share with you if you wish to listen. Our knowledge comes from Aboriginal terms of reference and our insights from an Aboriginal Perspective and of course we acknowledge that there are many Aboriginal Perspectives: this is ours. Aunty Mary Graham is a Kombu-Merri woman from the Gold Coast and is affiliated with the Wakka Wakka language group through her mother. Aunty Lilla Watson was raised on the banks of the Dawson River; the Brigalow country of her mother's people. In this documentary these two knowledgeable women share through Aboriginal terms of reference the tenets of human conditioning. .They both discuss the privilege of human relationships and the symbiotic connection that humans occupy with country.
