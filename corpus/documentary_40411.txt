On a sunny day of 1988 a small mine in a forgotten corner of Portugal shut its doors and left 600 families living from the memories of a place that was much more than a workspace: it was their reason to live. They are still being paid and everybody keeps living in the houses provided by the mine but literally no one works and no one does anything except charishing the past. Lousal is a place haunted by the past stuck at the end of a one-way dirty road trying to fight the inevitable death with memories from the ones still alive.
