The first battles of the Cristiada seemed more like a 'hunt'. According to the Federal Army the Cristeros did not have arms organization or experience. 'We were very inexperienced very young' - said the Cristeros. 'The war'- they thought - 'was like a party that would end in a few days'. However that 'party' was prolonged. The Cristeros equipped with arms put up pitched formal battles. Now they were no longer hunts nor guerrilla operations. They were bloody combats with hundreds of victims on both sides: it is the triumph of death.
