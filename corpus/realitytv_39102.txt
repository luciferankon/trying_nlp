My Space Rants! filmed over 600 New Yorkers in five days expressing their thoughts gripes and opinions on any topic they chose from their boyfriends and mothers to the environment and global warming. The one-minute rants were then posted in near real time on MySpace where participants could add comments share the videos with friends to encourage them to create and post their own rants. Scarpa's theme of participants not only as consumers but as content creators was an integral part the project. The series has garnered over 10 million viewers to date.
