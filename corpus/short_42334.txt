Ifé has come to San Francisco from Paris. She cruises in a Buick Riviera sometimes dressing as a woman sometimes as a man. She describes herself as a woman who adores women and San Francisco is just the place for Ifé to taste all their flavors and styles. Her secret: don't fall in love. Even so as she reflects on her year in S.F. and the women she's known there she thinks of her close call with Anna and she wistfully remembers Whitney.
