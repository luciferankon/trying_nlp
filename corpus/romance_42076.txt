Adorably naive Kao Mei-Nu ('Lyan Cheng' (qv)) is all set to become a nun when she is asked to temporarily masquerade as her twin brother Kao Mei-Nan ('Lyan Cheng' (qv) in a dual role) and join the popular boy band A.N.Jell. She reluctantly agrees in the hope that doing so will help the siblings reunite with their long lost mother. As if living under the same roof with her male band mates isn't enough her struggle to keep her identity a secret is further complicated by lead vocalist Huang Tai-Ching ('Jiro Wang' (qv)) who could not be more displeased with her arrival.
