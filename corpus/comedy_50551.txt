Shank is a delusional ex-Tennis professional from Britain. He was bestowed the nickname of Shank by McEnroe. Shank considers it as a badge of honor. Shank now aims to make his way into tennis journalism after his disastrous career as a player has finally come to an end. It appears his skills with a racquet are even better than they are with a microphone.
