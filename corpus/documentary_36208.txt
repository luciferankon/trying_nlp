The cold war ended 1989. The threat of a nuclear conflict disappeared. Or did it? Today the once new bomb-shelters are dusty but kept operational. The German government still stores food and gasoline diesel and crude oil. Infrastructural points of strategic interest could be detonated and stop the advance of the 'enemy'. With the fall of the iron curtain the secret files of war were opened. Fuer den Ernstfall (In case of emergency) tries to understand this madness. How prepared is the Bundesrepublik for the event of disaster?
