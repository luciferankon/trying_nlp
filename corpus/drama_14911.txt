In 1950 life as usual in a middle-American town. Cold War paranoia is beginning; the young men's biggest concern is the draft board and deferments from the peacetime army. Then the Korean War begins and the Greer family starts to worry: kid brother Jack courting the lovely daughter of the draft board chairman is next on the list. A character study examining American attitudes of that era. It's the beginning of the Korean conflict era when most are uncertain about if there will be a war and if so if the Americans should get involved. The Greers who live in Greenhill a small American everytown are as concerned as anyone. They own a family operated contracting business - an essential service - and thus those in power at the company such as eldest son Martin Greer the business' primary engineer are probably immune from the draft. Martin had already served for the country during World War II where his brother Riley Greer was killed and which followed in the footsteps of his father Thomas Greer who proudly served during World War I. Martin's wilder younger brother Jack Greer has a trick knee which will also probably exempt him from military duty which suits him just fine as he is more obsessed with a young woman named Carrie Turner. Others in town such as George Kress look to Martin to write letters for their loved young men (in George's case his namesake son who everyone calls Junior) to state that they are indispensable in their work which Martin is unwilling to do. When the conflict escalates into an American involved war everything changes. All the Greers have to examine their true feelings about war about this war and if it would be any different if their loved ones or themselves were not involved.
