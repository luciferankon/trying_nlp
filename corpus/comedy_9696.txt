A regular student house in London. A regular bunch of students and ex-students. This is their home from home - only home is India! Meet the Anglistanis a bunch of "Desis" trying to make their way in the big city. Arpit; tall handsome studying... or is he? Sameer; funny greedy lazy - he's here to study... what was that subject? Kalpana; she's a model student... and a nag! Rehan; he's a student of IT... and love! Jignesh; he's a student of life... and trying to earn a crust. Arjun; he's the master of the house... or is he? The house is bursting at the seams and landlord-cum-father figure Kuldeep is trying to keep order. But when the beautiful Nisha Arpit's old flame from India asks for a place to stay their world is turned upside down with love triangles gangsters and even cross dressing Mujra dancers!
