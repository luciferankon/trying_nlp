In this late-night traveling show "Tour guide" Dave Attell visits late night spots (including bars strip clubs and clubs) and talks to whoever he finds. There's no home base for the show as Dave is shown in different locations throughout North America each week. The average "guest" to the show could be naked cross dressing or just completely drunk.
