Beide Seiten is a video documentary of how Berlin has transformed from a divide city to a global nation. Remnants of the Berlin Wall are still visible but that hasn't stopped the city from progressing and embracing new culture and diversity. Artwork on the remains of the wall brings forth this optimism. This movie is a concoction of footage from 1961 when the wall was built and video shot in summer 2007.
