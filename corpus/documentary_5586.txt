Women On The Land - Creating Conscious Community highlights an extraordinary community of women on the Mendocino Coast in Northern California from the late 1960s to 2012. The film opens with archival footage of women who founded "Country Women" the extremely successful 1970s feminist publication and how-to magazine for women's back-to-the-land self-sufficiency. Featuring the work these women have done to protect the land and sea over the last 40 years the film follows women homesteaders farmers and goatherds who have created the life of their dreams on the land they call home. These women passionately reveal why the sustainable organic local food movement is essential in our current world of dwindling natural resources and economic decline.
