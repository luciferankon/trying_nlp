Passed up for promotion. His girlfriend broke up with him and stole all his furniture. All Chris has left is four empty ice cube trays a twenty-three page letter (front and back) and an annoying friend Jay. Separately they are nothing. Together they aren't much more. Nonetheless they shall embark on an adventure to discover the Greatest Beer of All Time. They shall mostly fail. It will be completely obvious to everyone. And yet they shall be worshipped by the beersicle sucking townsfolk. They shall conquer the Evil Doppelganger befriend the vegetarian Crunchy Bitch and survive an hour in prison. The bar bill will be huge. The line for the bathroom more huge. But in the end at least there will still be incriminating photos.
