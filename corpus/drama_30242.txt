Ten years ago Ginny (Toni Gonzaga) an Architecture student and Marco (Piolo Pascual) a History professor began a one-of-a-kind and unpredictable love story. In the five years that they were together they brought out the best in each other which included Marco's unrealized dream of becoming a chef. Together they worked towards their dream of opening up a restaurant but when Ginny realized her own pursuits were different from his she rejected his wedding proposal and left the country for a Masters degree in Architecture. At present Ginny co-owns a one-stop Architecture and Interior Design firm specializing in Restoration. She receives an email from Marco which was written and sent after their break-up meant to be read four years later. It makes her feel even more regretful of leaving the love of her life. When their firm receives an offer to restore an old house into a restaurant she is ecstatic to learn that Marco will be co-owning the restaurant. She takes this as a sign that this will be their second chance they need but finds out that Marco wants the restaurant ready for his wedding proposal to his US-based girlfriend Patty De Guia (Iza Calzado). This doesn't stop Ginny from accepting the project in the hopes of winning back Marco now very different from the man he used to be. When he learns her motives he plays along to push her regrets and show that he is much better now. But their actions take a toll on them when they talk about the past feelings start to get involved and Patty begins to get suspicions about the two. Can mistakes and wrong decisions be undone to give way to a second chance? Will Ginny get her happy ending with Marco or is she four years too later?
