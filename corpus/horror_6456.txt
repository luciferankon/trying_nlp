The story in this horror movie involves a young woman's unknowing participation in a satanic ceremony which causes her to be possessed by the spirit of her dead father. She promptly begins exhibiting the standard symptoms - curses vomiting and even twisting the heads of a few people 180 degrees. Naschy plays the village priest summoned to perform the rites of exorcism and must fend off the possessed's lewd advances before casting the evil spirit out of her body.
