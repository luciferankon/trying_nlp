At some point everyone has asked the question why is it so hard to find love? In this final installment of the autobiographical trilogy that includes Vinyl and I Curmudgeon Alan Zweig reflects with disarming candour on why if he longs for a partner and children he is still single at mid-life. Through intimate heartfelt and often hilarious interviews with a series of diverse smart and attractive single women Zweig explores yearnings for the romantic myths of our culture and the difficulty of finding and sustaining relationships. Some women have come to accept and prefer being alone but many still dream of a future they can share. Rather than remaining the objective observer Zweig approaches his female subjects as kindred spirits sharing their vulnerability and openness. A perfect mixed tape of love songs provides the backdrop for this courageously candid look at love and longing.
