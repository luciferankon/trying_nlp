Deep below the Earth it is the start of a new shift for the workers at the local mine. Above them in their small town their families friends and neighbors busy themselves with their everyday routines - complete with petty squabbles and arguments. However when an earthquake hits causing a collapse at the mine many of the workers are trapped underground with a limited supply of air. At a time when the whole community must come together as one to help those trapped by the disaster deep-rooted prejudices are allowed to resurface threatening any hope of the collective rescue effort that is required to save the miners.
