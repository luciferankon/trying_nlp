5000 miles tells the story of a couple from the mid-west who decide to adopt a child from Poland. This film was originally designed to be a video diary of how their new son or daughter became a part of their family but evolved into a 75 minute film exploring the emotionally draining experience of traveling across the globe to create their family. The film follows the hopeful mom and dad from the beginning of the adoption process and ends once the whole family is home a period of 20 months. Interviews in the US and Poland give detailed information and emotion.
