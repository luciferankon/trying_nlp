Lauren's been seeing things in her bathroom: a silent child of about six. Diego has written a paper on parapsychology so he holds a séance with the disbelieving co-eds. Something goes awry because bad things start to happen and the students' only defender is an aging campus cop named Syd. What's the silent ghostly girl's secret and can Alison discover what's going on before it's too late?
