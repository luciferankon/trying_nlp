Despite decades of research and the use of modern technology scientists are still not able to detect in time an imminent earthquake. Even though seismologists mostly know where the faults are and are able to closely monitor the rate of activity on them ranging from a scale of a year to a decade and even a century a solid short-term day to month forecasting in order to identify the places at risk still is an insoluble problem. Although this may be true some scientists in diverse fields choose to follow a different and a rather controversial approach on the subject by studying the unusual behavioural changes of animals and archiving the strange phenomena before an earthquake. With this intention scientists all over the world struggle to substantiate the connection between the animals' extra-sensitive sensory abilities and the movement of the continental and tectonic plates in a way that can be useful for society. Could indeed the animals provide mankind with additional knowledge in the hope that one day we will be able to safely predict and avoid the aftermath of an earthquake?
