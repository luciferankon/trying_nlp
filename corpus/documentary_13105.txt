Optimise your display PixelProtector provides a range of tools for video measurement that support a broad range of formats and resolutions. The best measurement of a TV s picture is of course the viewer's satisfaction with the image being displayed. When looking at a moving image or even a still frame on your display it can be difficult to know if you have any colour bleed or dot crawl(unless it is severe). Can you be sure that your panel is setup correctly? Using test signals in PixelProtector allows you to accurately adjust your screen to its full potential. The quality of analog and digital video systems can been measured indirectly by measuring the distortions of static test signals. Subjective human visual assessments can provide invaluable information for you to optimize your displays image quality.

Specific test signals are provided for aligning and calibrating projection sets over head projectors and rear projection. PixelProtector is the complete video test reference and maintenance tool.
