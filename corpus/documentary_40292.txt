The last Irani chai by Khalid Mohamed A salute to the surviving spirit of the Irani tea-shops of Mumbai. Most of them have vanished from the city with the vagaries of time and the advance of fast-food chains. Yet a few of them continue to be an integral part of the city's culture and hospitality. Besides revisiting the chai shops and bakeries the documentary also meets up with regular patrons of the cafe including the late artist M F Husain who longed to return to the restaurants which he once inhabited with other painters and writers.
