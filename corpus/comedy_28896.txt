The Chaos Crew is about five college students and their adventures. Grace Kelli Mei Cori and Ashley all attend Hubert Francis University Home of the Fighting Flamingos. They don't really fit in with the main social groups at their college so they form their own group the Chaos Crew. They also work together at a coffee shop.
