William E. Jones's autobiographical film about growing up gay in the small Ohio town of Massillon pushes the boundaries of documentary by offering a moving self-portrait within the context of gay political history. Combining provocative voiceover with evocative imagery Massillon gets its message across and tells Jones's story without the presence of onscreen human narrators or actors. Part one offers shots of Massillon a Rust Belt town victimized by outsourcing as Jones recounts memories of his youth. The second part shows images of government buildings as Jones recites laws restricting sexual activity. The third and final portion contrasts the neutral landscapes of Santa Clarita California with narration detailing the history of sexual persecution. This homo road movie... uses the quiet landscapes of the American Midwest to look at a history disfigured by myths of the family patriotism and religion.
