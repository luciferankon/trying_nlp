Rancher Pop Morton and his daughter Molly are victims of Blair Hatley (who is pursuing Molly and holds the mortgage on their ranch). Molly meets Art Downs but she does not know that he is a Texas Ranger.. Art is mistaken by Steve Baird (who is one of Blair Hatley's men) for "The Terror" a notorious Arizona bandit. Art goes along with it to go after the rustlers for Pop and Molly. He finds that Molly has been kidnapped by the rustlers. Art rescues Molly but is then stopped along the trail by Hatley's brother. Molly is taken again by the rustlers. Later Art returns to the Morton ranch with a posse. He rescues Pop Morton and Molly from the rustlers. He then discloses his true identity as a Texas Ranger and wins Molly's heart.
