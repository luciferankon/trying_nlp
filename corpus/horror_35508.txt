A British haunting/horror film that starts with a bang but then settles into a slow-moving examination of one day in the life of British family -- a day full of tension and foreboding. A schoolgirl takes a shortcut through some woods and is seized by an unseen malevolent force. She is never seen again and the authorities erect an iron fence around the woods to prevent a recurrence. Three years later another schoolgirl regularly visits the fence and speaks with something that is invisible. The malevolent force seems to affect her family first in dreams and later in more concrete ways.
