This documentary will look at a side of Hollywood that many have tried to ignore... Santa Monica Blvd and the night scene of transgender women that prostitute themselves many times to the bigwigs of the studios. We will hear from the transgender women that grew up out on those streets many of which suffered hatred and discrimination at home and were forced out into that life. We will take a look at how the disease of addiction runs rampant out there and how the police may have cleaned up the Blvd somewhat but the girls now work the internet. We will speak to some of the transgender women that have been sent to jails and prisons and what happened behind those walls by both correctional officers and inmates. We will also look at how these women have survived and have gotten out of that life and what they are doing now. We will also look at how they are now beaming pillars of light in the community so that our transgender youth wont have to suffer the same fate. Then we will look at what it will take in the world so that our youth and our future transgenders will have a better chance at a happy life and how some of those changes are already happening.
