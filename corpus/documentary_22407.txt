The "Israel Experience" is the biggest Zionist project in over a decade. Its sole purpose is to create new allies for the State of Israel in times of crisis. To this end "Israel Experience" provides young Jews from around the world guided tours of the Holy Land. The film accompanies a group of young Americans on their intensive bus journey across a strong and righteous Israel. The marketing of Israel as such juxtaposed against the reality reveals our need as a society to not confront our flaws.
