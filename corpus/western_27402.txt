Pretending death at the hands of his friend Marshal Pat Garrett ('Bob Duncan (I)' (qv)). Billy the Kid ('Anthony Dexter (I)' (qv)) rides away to live in peace under a new name in a far away frontier town only to run foul of ruthless empire builder Col. Morgan ('Robert Lowery (I)' (qv)) and his top gun Jack Slade ('Sonny Tufts' (qv)). Billy's the only man who can stop Morgan but he turns down the pleas of help from preacher Jericho Jones ('Charles 'Buddy' Rogers' (qv)) who knows of Billy and his past newspaper editor Elly McCloud ('Madalyn Trahey' (qv)) and her romantic rival Tonya ('Marie Windsor' (qv)). It's only after the preacher is shot down trying to stop Morgan's killers that Billy straps on his guns. The outlaw Billy the Kid is presumed killed by Pat Garrett. But Garrett has helped Billy fake his death on Billy's promise to go straight and never draw his guns again. Billy meets up with gunslinger Jack Slade who is furious to learn (he thinks) that Billy the Kid is dead as he's devoted his career to tracking down and besting all the top gunfighters. Slade ends up working for Colonel Morgan who runs his section of the territory with an iron hand. Billy is befriended by minister Jericho Jones who knows his true identity. When Morgan's men ride roughshod over the townspeople Jericho calls on Billy to strap on his guns one more time.
