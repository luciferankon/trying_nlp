Seven days or rather evenings and nights in the life of Jenka ('Stanislava Bartosová' (qv)) a young good-looking nurse. Jenka is attractive to men and enjoys their company but there is a limit beyond which she won't go since she is faithful to her Filip who is doing his military service. On Sunday the girl awaits Filip to arrive on a short period of leave but instead his friend Míla ('Frantisek Nemec (I)' (qv)) turns up and apologizes for Filip who has to stay in the barracks.
