Living off the Grid: Extreme Iceland - is a UK/Icelandic co-production exploring the country's most extreme locations and inhabitants. This project brings together a small team of professional filmmakers from both Iceland and the UK (whose credits include work produced for the BBC Channel 4 and ITV as well as distributed independent feature films and major productions such as Fast and Furious 8) to capture testimonies from people who have experienced firsthand the social effects of the environment on their lives.
