Young Samson Oakley III is the only son of Samson Oakley II the distinguished head of a prominent Wall Street firm. When he is expelled from college--although for an offense he didn't commit--his angry father puts him on a small allowance and basically exiles him. However when he marries a chorus girl his father disinherits him altogether. Desperately trying to make some money the young man discovers he has an innate talent as a safecracker. His newfound skill is put to the test though when he discovers that several of his father's crooked colleagues are plotting to take over his father's firm by spreading false rumors about his death and stealing some valuable securities.
