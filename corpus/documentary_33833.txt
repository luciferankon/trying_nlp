Imagine you have been imprisoned subjected to torture released and forced to leave your homeland as a refugee imprisoned again released again and once more captured and sentenced to death. This was the reality for Ali Saeed an Ethiopian imprisoned in his homeland and in Somalia for trying to spread freedom of speech and freedom of the mind. Ali and many other Ethiopians with similar experiences were able to escape to countries such as Canada and they are now ready to speak about the period in Ethiopia's history known as the "Red Terror".
