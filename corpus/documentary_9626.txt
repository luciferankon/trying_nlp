John Ogdon was Britain's greatest classical pianist and with his wife Brenda Lucas Ogdon made up one of the most successful musical partnerships of the last 50 years. But with the dizzying heights of success came adversity and a mental breakdown. This documentary is an unflinching look at the talented but troubled man. For the first time his widow Brenda and their children Annabel and Richard tell the personal journey of John Ogdon - the husband father and genius - and the emotional journey from international acclaim to being certified insane.
