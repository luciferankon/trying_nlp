Backroads with Ron and Raven celebrates the outdoor life-style with an emphasis on unique characters. The show is a hallmark of Ron Schara Productions driven by Emmy-award winning writing and storytelling. Backroads originally started as an ESPN favorite in the 90's with host Ron Schara and his sidekick lab Raven. They toured the country sharing stories from well-known and unknown outdoor enthusiasts alike. Today Ron continues to share these outdoor passions and pursuits through Fox Sports Network (North and Wisconsin) on a weekly basis. Join Ron and his black lab Raven as they head to the back roads.
