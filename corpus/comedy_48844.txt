Comedy is a universal cure for what ails us and the power of laughter can touch relieve and help us transcend any ethnic or gender barriers at home and around the world. "The Comedy Underground Series" looks to break fresh new faces and re-introduce seasoned veterans who are currently absent from the mainstream television and media. The series is shot with segments featuring a docu-style format so we can hear first hand about a comic's journey on the road to stardom. We look to have this series emerge as a funny and thought provoking stand-up comedy show with a twist of "real life." A comedian's path is not always easy but they do their best every performance to bring laughter where there is need and an audience. We salute comedians as they are examples that there is always a Silver Lining.
