A close-up of Berlin coal carriers from Prenzlauer Berg. No portrayal of worker heroes or progress here. Instead bright deeply-felt sketches of rough men and their resolute woman boss. "Refreshing and new... A beautiful sometimes whimsical documentation of Berlin workers. A cinematic correction of what in general was valued in an East German documentary." - Elke Schieber film historian
