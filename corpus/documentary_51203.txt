Follow the multi-media film project One Year Road Trip and track the Webb family as we crisscross America visiting each state and DC in search of children making the world a better place to live. Our hope is to illuminate the stories of the kids we meet inspire other children to go change the world and be transformed as a family by immersing ourselves in the stories of the growing Generation of Generosity.
