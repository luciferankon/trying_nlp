Adam Carolla is known as a radio and television personality. He has also spent several years working in the construction industry. The Adam Corolla Project is his attempt to take a house in Los Angeles gut it down to the support beams and rebuild it selling it for over a million. He finds his father is selling Adam's childhood home and he buys the house and brings in his crew. He describes them as "good workers but they need supervision." Adam however only stops by an hour or so a day and then goes off to his radio program. Lunch seems to be the crew's primary focus. Each new feature must be approved by the city inspector and seem to be approved on the first inspection. There are guest appearances by Jimmy Kimmel and Kathy Griffin and the work continues to fall behind schedule. Toward the end Adam brings in a foreman and puts on his own tool belt to finish the house. Then the real estate saleswoman enters. "You talk to the camera let me sell the house" is her attitude. Many of the people involved are non-show business friends of Adam's in the course of the show his parents his nephew and his personal assistant all have their moment in the Project which is filmed like a reality TV program. The Adam Carolla Project features the comedian in his lesser known roles as a registered contractor and skilled carpenter. Adam has purchased a run-down house somewhere in Los Angeles. It's a fixer-upper in the extreme. Now Adam and his crew of friends and family who don't know a saw from a screwdriver will spend the next several months restoring the home to its former glory and far beyond.
