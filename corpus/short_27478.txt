n the Landes forest of Gironde in south-west France a group of cowboys with thick Gascon accents go about a recreated Far-West landscape.

From saloon to prairie colts are quivering and eyes are darting. Somewhere in between utopia and entertainment historical tale and pure fiction these men and women are involved in ambiguous role-play:to what extent is it fake and when does it start to be real?
