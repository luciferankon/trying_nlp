After surviving brain surgery radiation and chemotherapy a 2-year-old boy lay in a coma not eating for over 40 days. His parents are told to make funeral arrangements. However his father had read about a version of an ancient drug made from cannabis. Unbeknownst to the hospital staff the parents start secretly injecting the illegal drug into their dying son's feeding tube and soon a "miracle" takes place. When the doctors are told that cannabis was the cause of the "miracle" they have nothing to say. Every war has unintended victims and it's the children who are losing America's longest running war. From cartel recruiting grounds of Mexico - to a child being removed from his birth mother for smoking marijuana. Is it a conspiracy? Or simple profit motives that continue to keep marijuana inside the black market?
