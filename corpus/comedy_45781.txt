Between September 1940 and August 1944 luxury hotels are requisitioned by the Germans as staff headquarters giving the hotels' employees a ringside seat of the enemy's secrets and activities. Such is the case with Royal Palace run by Maxime and Solange Verdier in which the Abwerth the German counter-intelligence service establishes its HQ. Not only this but they also have to welcome François Maxime's intrusive brother who comes to the hotel at the request of the German authorities to reform the orchestra which made him famous before the war. At the same time a Resistance network working the capital's top hotels and led by the mysterious "D'Artagnan" starts to cause mayhem for the German counter-intelligence agents. Is Maxime the Royal Palace's peaceful manager really D'Artagnan? Is oily François the awful collaborator he seems? Such questions become explosive when a Jewish family take shelter at the hotel joining the employees in their tasks while knowing nothing about the hotel business.
