From a murky landscape a wooded mountain emerges. We watch the sun. We see a bearded man climbing up the mountain through the snow. He carries an ax and he's accompanied by a dog. His labors continue. There is no soundtrack. Images rush past - water trees and surfaces too close up to distinguish. He struggles. A fire burns. Nature in long shots and magnified is formidable and silent. It's tough going; he carries on. In a capillary blood flows.
