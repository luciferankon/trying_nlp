In spite of what man has done to the Everglades nature has found a way to survive. Water is the heart's blood of South Florida and the Everglades. With water comes life creating an ongoing cycle of life: birds mammals and reptiles mating nesting hatching nurturing babies hunting surviving. All take place in mystical landscapes inhabited by some form of life: human bird animal or reptile. Every day is a National Geographic special from hiking on boardwalks to getting your feet wet if you wish. We go birding with Audubon onto uninhabited mangrove islands to count spoonbills slosh through water and mangrove roots in search of wood stork nests and walk to the center of Lake Okeechobee to experience snail kite's quest for food. Senator Bob Graham narrates as we follow him Everglades National Park's first Hispanic Superintendent Pedro Ramos the Miccosukee nature photographers Mac Stone and Clyde Butcher artists Elizabeth Thompson and Tom Weinkle and conservation giant Nathaniel Reed deep into Everglades to discover its secrets and hear its heartbeat. We want to stun people with Everglades' beauty and win their hearts. Seven milllion Floridians live within 50 miles of the Park yet NPS Ranger Alan Scott says most Americans don't know the Everglades exists or that it provides drinking water for South Florida.
