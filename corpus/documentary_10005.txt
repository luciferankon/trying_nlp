The Tchiloli is performed by prominent men of certain quarters of the island. Originally from France the Tchiloli was introduced in Săo Tomé in the XVIth century. The main roles are transmitted from generation to generation. Dressed in European clothes (mainly women costumes) and wearing masks the male actors narrate a Renaissance text with music and dance turning this spectacle into an extravagant cultural manifestation of African and European heritage.
