In essence this film is an analysis of the spiraling consciousness of a dying man. His delirious memories of events past and possibly future are spun into a cascade of abstract and twisted glimpses. The haunting imagery and disturbing sound is matched only by its fearless brand of unremitting narrative. Hold your breath for four and a half minutes. For the director this film was a cathartic exercise influenced by both the death of his father and a Salvador Dali painting of the same name. Awarded Best Experimental Film by the Melbourne International Film Festival 1998
