Six years ago God told former rabbi Philip Sharp that he was to become a Hebrew king. Philip then decided to take seven women to be his wives and created a new Godly family. Now they all live together in one house in a quiet English town. Filmmaker Marc Isaacs insinuates himself into the family to try and understand why seven women have chosen to live under the rule of one man.
