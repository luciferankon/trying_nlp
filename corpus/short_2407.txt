Inspired by the bumbling acting troupe 'the Mechanicals' from Shakespeare's comedy 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' 'die Mekaniks' (dee mek-a-NEEKS) fly the flag for struggling artists everywhere. These 6 hapless characters once world-renowned social revolutionaries nearly get arrested for their guerrilla performance outside San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts. They return to their broken down bus in the middle of the desert wondering if they will ever get back on the stage. This story of creative death and rebirth is told in die Mekaniks' language of Germish - a tongue of unknown origin yet surprisingly easy to understand.
