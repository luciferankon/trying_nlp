Since the first days of Great Big Sea back in the spring of 1993 the Newfoundland based band has wanted to make a live album. Known across the country for their incendiary and powerful performances their recent tour provided the perfect opportunity to do so. The result is an unusual live document of a band in love with traveling their music and the excitement of standing on stage in front of a crowd.
