A down-on-his-luck Hollywood filmmaker Linus Van Scooter thinks he's found a Heavenly Angel: to show up in a little town in New Hampshire and con its mayor and residents into putting money into a movie he has absolutely no intention of making. The scam works beautifully until his lovely and loyal muse has had enough of the game and leaves Linus to fend for himself with no credit card or license and no choice but to make the movie. And grudgingly to accept that the woods are full of remarkably talented and passionate true believers who in turn inspire Linus to embark on a hilarious and heartfelt journey back to the long-forgotten artist he once was.
