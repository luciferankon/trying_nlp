Antonio Cuadri's drama La Buena Voz (aka The Good Voice) explores the relationship that develops between a father and a gay son he never knew existed -- two men suddenly and unexpectedly thrust into each other's lives. Pepe a slightly listless fifty-something taxi driver with a heart condition suddenly learns that he fathered a child Jordi from a quiet affair with his wife's girlfriend. Jordi now HIV-positive enters Pepe's world and recolors the elder's perspective and outlook on life with his take-no-prisoners zeal for living and a restless inquisitive spirit.
