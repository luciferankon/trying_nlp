This is a factual documentary featuring the American Sommelier Colin West at the age of 25 as he goes through New Zealand's top wine producing regions with the local kiwi girl Jo Holley and the two of them catch up with local winemakers in each region they visit. In this documentary these two don't only learn about the diversity of NZ wine and different aspects of viticulture and oenology yet they use wine as his medium to take them to the most popular travel destinations New Zealand has to offer and they even pull every winemaker out of their comfort zone to experience their region from a new extreme and adventurous angle.
