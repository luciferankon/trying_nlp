The story tells about Jack a martial artist who competes in an MMA tournament in Japan in an effort to gain the acceptance of his American biological father -- a man whom he has never met. Jack wins the tournament -- but learns too late that the victory brings with it life-long servitude to the Yakuza. Far more interested in gaining his father's approval than with the penthouse money girls and fancy cars that come with being the Yakuza's Champion Jack escapes the Yakuza and heads to the U.S. to look up his father and show him the championship belt. But on the way he gets stranded in Centerville an isolated rural California mining town that time and excitement has passed by and is ruled by an insane Chief of Police. When the Chief learns of Jack's celebrity status in the world of MMA from a mysterious young woman claiming to be a reporter from "Ultimate Fighter Magazine" the Chief sees an opportunity to change his town's dead-end existence and gives Jack an ultimatum: fight in a staged tournament in Centerville or go to prison on trumped-up charges. When an escape from Centerville is made possible by a brave and helpful local Jack faces the dilemma of saving himself or helping rid the town of the power mad Chief. Deciding on the latter he stays. The Chief abruptly loses control of his tournament with the arrival of the Yakuza boss and martial artists from around the world -- all hell-bent on unseating Jack and becoming the Yakuza's Champion. The tournament becomes a fight-to-the-death -- a fight with unexpected twists and turns.
