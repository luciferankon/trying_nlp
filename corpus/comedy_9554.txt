Mendocino College Theatre Department presents William Shakespeare's "A Comedy of Errors" taped on multiple High Definition cameras over several nights to best represent the theater experience for DVD viewing! Two identical twins and their two servants (also identical twins) are separated in a ship-wreck. When years later they all show up in the same town mistaken identities abound. This rollicking comedic romp is one of Shakespeare's most delightful and accessible plays.
