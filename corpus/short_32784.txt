A ship has just returned from Operation Mosaic the first British Nuclear tests in the South Atlantic. Onboard a mutineer (Evets) has just escaped from his cell and is looking for food in the ship's Galley. There he encounters The Caterer (Smith) who has been serving up food since Nelson's time. Ron complains of the conditions on board "These are worse conditions than in Nelsons time" the Caterer responds "In Nelsons time there were no conditions!" The confrontation spirals into disconcertingly vertiginous realms as the two try to disembark.
