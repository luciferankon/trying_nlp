Sunderbans (Forest of Beauty) is in West Bengal India and is the only place on Earth that is the natural habitat of Royal Bengal Tigers that have never known to be fearful of humans. One tiger has been known to kill three fully grown men leaving behind orphans and widows who belong to poor tribes dependent on harvesting wild honey and fishing in a swampy mangrove region. About 80 people are killed annually by these ferocious beasts with razor-sharp jaws whose forepaws can shatter bones and sharp teeth can pierce a skull in one bite. Amidst religious superstitions the narrator attempts to explain the cause behind their taste for human meat in a region devoid of electricity roadways firearms and safe drinking water and why the villagers continue to live there despite of being stalked and mauled on land and water alike.
