Abandoned or held in low regard by colonial viceroys businessmen bishops and high-ranking military men the gradual conquest of Sonora would be the work of combative spirits from the ambitious Jesuit missionaries to its conquerors' ambitions and conflicts. To the north of the RÃ­o Fuerte Sonora's old indigenous nations especially the Yaquis and the Mayos would be forced to establish a secular battle of resistance: a struggle so great that it stands without comparison to any other struggle of this kind in Mexican history. From the long and violent encounters between white colonizers and Sonora's proud Indians it is only logical that a strong character and a lively decisive temperament would surface among Sonora's residents today.
