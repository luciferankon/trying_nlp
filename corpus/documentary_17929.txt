The Physical Body is a rare unique look at the dying art of Kushti India's indigenous form of wrestling and once royal national sport. The documentary shot on location in Northern India closely examines the mechanics and regimens of physical development adhered to by wrestlers during their intense training routines. The two daily workout sessions under the supervision of a guru at the local akharas or wrestling gymnasiums are based on an ancient traditional wrestling and physical culture template that dates back thousands of years. Training with total devotion and intensity the wrestler learns through exercise diet self-control and celibacy that his strength ultimately goes beyond the mere physical.
