Dear Diary. I'm going camping with my flatmates. It was totally my suggestion because I think we need some bonding time but in a different location that isn't our house. Well Maddi's parents house because it's not actually OUR house we just live there with Maddi. I googled heaps about camping so that it doesn't look like I've never even been anywhere that isn't near the city. And it's not that far from the city anyway but it's definitely really far from our house so I'm pretty excited. Love Emma. PS note to self: bring raid because I really hate bugs. Ew.
