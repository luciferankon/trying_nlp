What does it mean to be a philosopher and why philosophize at all? In this intimate and unconventional documentary portrait of three Slovenian philosophers of different philosophical positions - Ivan Urbancic Rado Riha and Marko Ursic - their more personal deliberations on what philosophy means to them and why they decided to be philosophers are intertwined with their philosophic thought about philosophy and the world in general. The film does not simply outline their philosophical positions; instead it lets us perceive the persons behind those positions their intimate worlds thus conjuring up actual film characters that are sometimes more real than reality itself.
