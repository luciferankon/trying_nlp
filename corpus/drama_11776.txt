Phyllis a middle-aged white divorcee lives alone and works from home. She curates a happier simulacrum of her life on social media. Her doctor diagnoses her with Multiple Sclerosis sending her into a depressive tail-spin. When Em a twenty-something black woman shows up to deliver a package Phyllis is relieved to make a connection however brief with another person in the real world. Then Em injures herself in a minor accident and Phyllis takes her in. Though separated by age race and background the two women seem to bond quickly - sometimes it's easier to open up to a stranger. Each has something to offer the other. But as they reveal more of themselves conflicts arise.
