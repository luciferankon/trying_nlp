This film is another bogus title gleaned from the pages of Richard E. Braff's extremely error-prone Silent Short Film Working Papers. There is no reliable documentation that a film bearing this title was produced by Pathé at this time. At the time of its alleged release (9 November 1913) Pearl White was working for Crystal not Pathé and Pathé did not release any film under any title on that day anyway. A variation of the same mis-information finds its way into Buck Rainey's also error filled Those Fabulous Serial Heroines where it's listed as Daisy Wins the Day but two wrongs don't make a right.
