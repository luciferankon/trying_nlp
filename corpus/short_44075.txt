A study of human relationships. A man lands on a bare wooden floor a red-brick wall behind him. From time to time things fall to the floor from above. Eventually he has a chair a table music and cigarettes. Then a woman lands in the space. They ease up to each other. They laugh they sleep together. He's spirited away a key; she's hidden a pistol. A door appears in their space. Can they negotiate? There are intimations that we are peering into a human aquarium.
