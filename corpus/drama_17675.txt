Savitri a middle aged woman is dissatisfied with her circumstances as she has an unemployed son a promiscuous teen daughter and a husband who has failed to provide her emotional and financial security. She tries to find fulfilment in relationships outside her marriage only to realize that men are the same beneath different faces. What makes Mohan Rakesh's portrait of Savitri (one of Hindi theatre's first feminist icons) so gripping is that one is never sure whether he admires her rage to get a grip on her life or whether he suggests that she is a woman caught in her destiny and circumstances in the manner of a tragic Greek heroine.
