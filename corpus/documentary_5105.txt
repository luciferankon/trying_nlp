The image of sexy women writhing on a metal pole to the pulses of driving music reflects a seedy form of male entertainment. But what happens when there are no men and it is only women dancing for each other? In My Erotic Body filmmaker Michele Beck takes us on a journey inside the world of pole dancing for the everyday woman. In the classroom lawyers mothers businesswomen and housewives of all ages and body types gyrate around the pole lap dance or slowly strip their clothes off while the other women cheer. As the film unfolds dance sequences are interspersed with pole dancing instruction and interviews with women who discuss their erotic dance personas the clothes they wear and the music that they dance to. Outside the studio Beck speaks with professionals in the fields of psychoanalysis and social criticism giving context to how the women are able to make this dance their own. My Erotic Body explores a community where women take the very aspects of a dance form associated with misogyny - stripper shoes skimpy clothes sexually submissive postures - and turns them on their head creating a space where the same clothes and gestures lead not objectification but instead lead the women to own their erotic bodies.
