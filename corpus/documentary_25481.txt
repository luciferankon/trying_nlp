During the 1960's Mexican art underwent the most important transformation that is was to have in the twentieth century. Adapting themselves to the post-68 situation in Mexico and trying to salvage the theories of Mexican art from the Mexican School groups of artists created collectives which sought to address the public and create new ways to understand art. They distanced themselves from the notion of art as object and created on a par with the rest of the world new codes and artistic languages that would remain the techniques and artistic structures until the end of the millennium. This documentary attempts to rescue these pioneering groups in the Mexican avant garde.
