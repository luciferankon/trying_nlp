Ladies and gentlemen we present to you the FULL interview with Brimstone president and CEO of Hound Comics. We met Brimstone a couple of weeks ago at the Great Allentown Comic Con and it was more than a pleasure speaking with such a Jack of all trades. His interview was so jam packed with awesomeness there was no way we could leave you all with just a snippet of it. From his days as a pro-wrestler to his life now as a writer editor and publisher - this interview covers it all. FUN FACT: his wrestling persona was the inspiration behind "Brimstone" in the Brimstone and the Borderhounds comics. If only we were cool as him.
