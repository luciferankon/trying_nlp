There is a reality television crew that shows up at the motel. They are from the show Ghost Encounters. They ask the owner for permission to video in search for ghosts. The owner of the motel gives them a tour of the place and tells them stories of murders and deaths that have taken place at the motel. He also shares motel guests' sightings and encounters with ghosts at the motel that have been shared and reported to him. They are given permission by the owner to spend the night at the motel in search of evidence of paranormal activity. Their electric magnetic instruments are spiked in different places on the property. Their search leads them to the storeroom. Once they enter they find a door to the attic which they had no idea existed. They go up and find a Santeria altar. Through investigation they learn that the janitor can communicate with ghosts and practices Santeria so they interview him. Mayhem ensues. And only the devil decides whose souls to keep.
