Water Pressures marks a unique opportunity to create a game-changer in the global water crisis. This documentary details the collaboration between the impoverished water distressed community in Rajasthan India and the students at Northwestern University in Evanston IL whose campus sits on one of the largest bodies of fresh water in the world. The story clearly demonstrates how understanding education and collaboration can lead to sustainable solutions particularly between developing and developed countries. Water Pressures used media diplomacy to create this partnership between water-scarce desert Rajasthan villages and water-rich Northwestern University. Over a four-year period we filmed in both communities organized and hosted water forums with legislative and industry leaders at Northwestern and created and led an educational exchange between Rajasthan and Northwestern.
