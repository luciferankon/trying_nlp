Aris a race driver meets a guy who looks incredibly like him. With evident curiosity he tries to find out from his friend Dimitris who this identical "stranger" is. He finds out that his name is Kyriakos and that he works in a car-repair shop. Kyriakos too however who is involved with Foteini is informed of Aris' existence and also from his own father he finds out that Aris is his twin brother who had been given up for adoption to a well-off gentleman Kaisaris. The latter as Ntiana Aris' friend finds out wanted a son to inherit his vast fortune. Ntiana helps Kyriakos become a singer while at the same time blackmailing Kaisaris. In the end the two brothers find out everything and Kaisaris is forced to sabotage Kyriakos' car so as to put him out of the running in the forthcoming race. At the last minute however Aris takes Kyriakos' place. The weak (as usually) heart (of Kaisaris) fails but Kyriakos manages to save his brother from an undeserved death.
