First of all "The Sacred Fire" is about the burning desire to get out there and film stuff. For some of us recording and editing moving images is roughly equivalent to the need for air and water. This film is a free-wheeling yet structured cinematographic doodle in the silly and touching margins of daily life. It's about a guy with a track record who decides to film the journeys he takes and the love he encounters along the way. Made over the span of three years "The Sacred Fire" embarks on the modest task of proving that pick-up a camera and film is just another way of expressing love.
