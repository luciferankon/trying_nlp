'Parallel Lives' is a film whose true stories are hard hitting with content which is a cause for debate and consideration and although uncomfortable must be watched through to the end. The style is designed to put no barriers between the audience and the characters. We dare them not to look or walk away. The actors have scripted the film telling their own true stories about the mental scars that remain from their being involved personally in the terrible tragedies that occurred during the 30 years of 'The Troubles' in Northern Ireland and how their Post Traumatic Stress Disorder has been 'Glossed over' by the politicians the Organizations that they were involved with and by History. These are the scars left by every conflict.
