Living in the valley is a portrait of rural Cotswold residents over one year. This year turned out not to be just any ordinary year big changes were taking place in the village. Iris and Norman life long residents are moving out the village is now mostly filled with incomers. The village shop and post office was on the verge of closure. Many villages around here have become dormitory towns but Chalford is not like that. The film celebrates the activities of villagers of all ages living their lives and keeping their community together.
