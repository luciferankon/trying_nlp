Fifty years ago a passionate social worker and music lover from Rotterdam started a boy choir to keep postwar boys occupied and from the streets. Today the Rotterdam Boychoir is a highly respected choir which contributes to major cultural events in the Netherlands and tours all over Europe. The film Sons of Art shows what it is like to be part of a boy choir a society of boys with its particular rites and ways and what impact singing in a boy choir has on the lives of boys today and in the past. It shows that even though these boys at a very young age sing the works of Mozart and Bach and participate in complicated concerts such as the Mattheus Passion they are still boys and play soccer with as much passion as they sing Purcell.
