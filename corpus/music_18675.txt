2012 is a special year for singer Glennis Grace. She didn't only produce her most personal album ever (This Is My Voice #2 in Dutch Album Top 100 chart) but she also performed for the first time in her career live in a complete sold-out show at the Heineken Music Hall (Amsterdam). Over 5.500 people witnessed a spectacular show where Glennis outperformed herself during 2.5 hours. During the concert she was supported by her 10 person band and colleagues Edwin Evers Lange Frans and Candy Dulfer. Comedian Jandino Asporaat performing as his alter ego Judeshka took care of a hilariously surprise act. The beautiful voice of Glennis Grace touches the audience deeply the reactions are ecstatic the critics throw heaps of praise.
