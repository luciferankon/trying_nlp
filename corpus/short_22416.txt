Heaven is a Place is set in the liminal waterfront spaces of the city's border with the sea the decommissioned military installations of Devil's Point the crumbling recreational structures of Plymouth Hoe including the iconic Lion's Den - which was once the (in)famous nude men's bathing area - and the brutal beauty of the 1950s-built Bretonside bus station soon to be demolished to make way for yet another 'leisure' development. Made in collaboration with members of Plymouth's Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Trans communities.
