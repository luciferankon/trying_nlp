One of the most advanced experiments in truly interactive film. Following an introductory scene that sets up the plot and presents Sophie the interactive character a crisis situation appears and the narrative stops. The viewer is asked a question. He or she has three choices as to how the story will continue. A few minutes later the heroine of the film faces a new crisis and the Web user is again asked to choose what her behavior will be. The first interactive episode is 19 minutes long. In the pilot three questions await the spectator-actor. Each time he or she can choose among three attitudes to be selected with a mouse click. In the end three totally different films will be viewed depending on the different paths taken at each viewing. The filmmakers wrote and shot the three screenplays corresponding to each question in advance.
