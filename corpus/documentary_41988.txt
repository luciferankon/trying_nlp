Madrid X Tokyo is an audiovisual piece that explores the dual condition of a person who has grown up within two different cultures having been born half Spanish and half Japanese. The aim of Madrid X Tokyo is to produce an awareness and cultural understanding. By means of artistic representation and visual media it was intended to concentrate on the similarities that both of these cultures share. It is hoped that this movie will become something useful for any further study or production related to visual art cross-culture or simply to promote the relationship that exists between Spain and Japan.
