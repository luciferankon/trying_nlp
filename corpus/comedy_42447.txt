Things are looking up for Justin Tanner (Ken Gayton). He has a great job as a therapist and he's about to marry the love of his life. That is until the love of her life shows up unexpectedly at the wedding after being a P.O.W. for over a year. As she rushes into the arms of man she thought she lost Justin is devastated. After a couple weeks of getting therapy from his 8 year old patient Justin is forced to take some time off. His best friend Stevenson (Jason Schaver) takes him out to a local bar to cheer him up by getting him laid. This is where he learns about Justin's gift which is really just his psychology education but to Stevenson it's the most amazing ability known to man. After weeks of going out night after night and getting laid Justin is exhausted and has to go back to work. He jokingly tells Stevenson if he wants to continue to go out all the time he needs to find a way to get paid for it. Taking it literally Stevenson who is a self proclaimed "Social Media Expert" finds a group of socially inept men that are more than willing to hand over the $$$ in order to learn the art of being a successful Wingman... and thus Wingmen Incorporated is born!
