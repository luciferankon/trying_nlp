This hour long documentary on the making of Alfred Hitchcock's "Marnie" incorporates the usual melange of contemporary interviews with surviving participants and liberal helpings of film clips and production shots. It also presents a nice selection of script pages and memos as well. In the former category we find cast members 'Tippi' Hedren Diane Baker and Louise Latham rejected screenwriters Joseph Stefano and Evan Hunter final screenwriter Jay Presson Allen daughter Pat Hitchcock O'Connell production designer Robert Boyle makeup artist Howard Smit unit manager Hilton Green Hitchcock historian Robin Wood composer Bernard Herrmann biographer Steven C. Smith and Hitchcock fan/filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. An entertaining account of the film's production the participants offer loads of valuable information and anecdotes. Highly enjoyable for Hitchcock fans and the film's growing number of admirers.
