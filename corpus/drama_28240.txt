Shorts by eight directors examine the boundary between Eros and porn. A feral man masturbates with the aid of a whirling crankshaft; a sunbathing woman phones a doctor for a playful house call; a man with a quartz penis goes through lovemaking castration cannibalism and restoration; a mouth and tongue close up lick viscous liquids of different colors and consistency; we watch a grainy film of a lesbian threesome their eyes and genitalia crudely scratched out; a director interviews ten men choosing one who picks among six actresses for a porn shoot; ink wash drawings become animated scenes of copulation; last while an infant cries a strobe illuminates adults at play.
