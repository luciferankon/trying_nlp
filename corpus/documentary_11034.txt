The first health documentary ever to delve deep into the mystifying quandary of disease and death in the African and African Diaspora community. Statistics show that African Americans comprise approximately 14% of America's national population. Yet they suffer disproportionately from a myriad of diseases that are believed to be "genetic." Oddly enough there is no empirical data linking the ancient ancestral continental Africans to many of these modern day so-called diseases. Contrary to conventional wisdom enslaved Africans did not arrive to the shores of America as a sick people. This film addresses all of the folklore and propaganda associated with sickness within the African American and African Diaspora communities.
