The psychedelic horror short directed by Savage starring herself and actress Amanda Adrienne is a 30-minute fever dream shot with handheld cameras in an airstream. The claustrophobia and obsession is palpable as we watch characters Layla and Devon completely unravel. Part satire part crushingly real Victim Number is the end result of every 'girl moves to LA to make it' cliché the deranged step-sister of the Hollywood Cinderella a biting critique of womanhood in the film industry ŕ la Bret Easton Ellis. Savage's reimagination of the overdone failing actress trop is in itself a feminist manifesto about losing and regaining control. Though Victim Number remains a dark portrait of being a woman in Hollywood Savage's self-awareness turns shame into success pain into power and femininity into freedom.
