Join BeanBag the world's most uptight cameraman as he follows three comedians on the road as they tour some of the smallest comedy venues on planet Earth all with one goal: drunken madness. With bar owners who flash the camera patrons who tear their clothes off and gallons of liquor chaos reigns. There's even a guest appearance by Comedy Central's Dave Attell. So basically it's another typical day in the Midwest.
