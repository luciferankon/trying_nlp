In the near future a new advanced technology called ReSPAWN comes of the assembly line. This state of the art tech allows a military field unit engage with short term reverse time jumps. However these time jumps have certain conditions. Firstly the ReSPAWN device will only engage in the pre-determined mission vicinity. Secondly the engaged will work within a pre-coded time window(the time will be proportional to vicinity size and mission priority level). Thirdly if an ReSPAWN field unit makes a reverse time jump the IQ of hostiles as well as awareness level of any hostiles in mission area will rise continually as unit re-engages device. Lastly if field unit fails to complete pre-determined mission within the decided time window the device will discontinue and all hostiles will be increased to full awareness level (Fractal Corp. is not responsible for any physical injuries towards operator of ReSPAWN device.) Adam a Soldier of Fortune is hired by a private Military correspondent (Allegedly not affiliated with Fractal Corporations) to test out this new ReSPAWN tech in the field. Events lead Adam to a an illegal weapons dump disguised as a country farm. In this location this Merc will be the first human to engage in ReSPAWN tech.
