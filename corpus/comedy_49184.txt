A timid man (Ed Wynn) is thrust into the spotlight when his father is honored as a hero. He blunders into a series of adventures because of a woman (Dorothy Mackaill) and becomes a hero himself. Although two political parties try to use him for their benefit he unwittingly foils all their plans. This is based on Wynn's famous radio character and the film ends with Wynn on his own radio show.
