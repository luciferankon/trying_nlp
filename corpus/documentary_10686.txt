This documentary film is a heartfelt glimpse at the passion of a people that have cultivated the steep mountainous land of a small region of the Italian Ligurian coastline called Le Cinque Terre to produce a little known specialty dessert wine called Sciacchetra' (Shock - eh - tra). Sadly enough the production of Sciacchetra' in the old way of the farmers growing harvesting vinifying and bottling their own Sciacchetra' is a rapidly vanishing age old tradition. With under twenty private generational Sciacchetra' producers left most are being maintained by an aging generation whose heirs are unwilling and uninterested in receiving the torch that has been passed down by nearly 25 generations. As one local resident Giuliano Basso (the unofficial mayor of Vernazza) who has cultivated Sciacchetra' as well as his father and grandfather commented "The younger generation just want to rent out rooms and work in the bars because cultivating grapes is too much work." The slogan of the film is "Passion Culture Legacy and Life" because it is the Passion that builds our Culture which leaves the Legacy of our Life. Watch as the film shows the path to the revitalization of Sciacchetra production.
