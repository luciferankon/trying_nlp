The story dives headfirst into the shallow end of the online dating pool to expose the hypocrisy of Internet dating companies: while they project a sentimental romantic front they're more interested in cold hard cash. We meet Claire a woman whose idea of a hot Saturday night involves a Hoarders marathon and eating frosting straight out of a can. However when she's hired by the world's largest online dating site Love's Bounty Hunter as a "Featured Dater" she finds her love life turned entirely upside down. As the whole world watches Claire's romantic exploits spiral into sheer insanity.
