A pregnant women is virtually a Kafka-esque beetle on her back looking for a plan THE PLAN which is sending her into strange situations. She forsees a life as a single mother and sees it impossible to break the historical nature of her family being well-divided. Unable to find a man who provides long term security and liberty for her to needs as a woman she enters motherhood with an idiosyncratic overview: the temporary fulfillment of the most important event in her life. Yet she finds all these thoughts and feelings are an extension of a moment in time canoeing on a placid lake with the father. The father does not understand the mother side he comes from an intact family; he does not understand the fleeting nature of love. This creates strain as the father tries to open lines of communication: finding the mother will never be capable of such behaviors and the father's role has come and gone as just an origin for genes. The father comes to terms with this because he does not understand the vicious cycle of divorce and coldness.
