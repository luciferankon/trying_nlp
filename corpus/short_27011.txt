A hodge-podge of archive footage with a commentary-narration by a Little Mr. I. Q.-type kid looking at inventions from the past. This one takes a look at the Wright Brothers and their airplane; Marconi inventing the wireless and Bell's telephone and Edison's electric light and then tosses in the first dirigible flight. It winds up in Oak Ridge Tennessee where footage involving the Atombic Bomb is shown. Jay Emanuel's "Exhibitor" trade-paper advised its subscribers that it was...."neither interest nor amusing." They were totally correct in their evaluation but that didn't keep the Paramount Theatre in Abilene Texas from foisting it off on its customers.
