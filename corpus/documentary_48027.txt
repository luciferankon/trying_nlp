Nearly every possible aspect of fimmaking used to produce the motion picture Signs (2002) is closely examined here. This serves as a good companion to the film normally where a commentary track would. Though it does feature a portion of promotional value it is still very informative and interesting to watch director M. Night Shyamalan at work.
