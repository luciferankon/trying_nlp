Seven million Floridians live within 50 miles of Everglades National Park yet nature soldiers on. Some locals think of the Everglades as a scary dangerous swamp filled with man-eating mosquitoes. In reality it is a place of great beauty serenity and more magnificent wading birds than any other place on the planet. We will stun people with Everglades' beauty and win their hearts. A little known Everglades' fact: it also provides the drinking water of one of out three Floridians. The original Everglades extended from Orlando to the tip of Florida. Senator Bob Graham narrates as we go birding with Audubon on uninhabited mangrove islands to count spoonbills slosh through water and roots in search of wood stork nests along the Tamiami Trail and walk to the center of Lake Okeechobee to experience snail kites' life in the wild. We discover orchids larger than your arms can encircle. Lotus blooming into infinity. Cypress domes bejeweled with blooming bromeliads and wildflowers galore. Even with development nature has found a way to survive in the Everglades and the Keys. Water is the lifeblood of South Florida and the Everglades. With water comes life creating an ongoing cycle of life: birds mammals and reptiles mating nesting nurturing babies hunting surviving. Every day is a National Geographic special from hiking on boardwalks to getting your feet wet if you wish. We go deep into Everglades to discover its secrets and hear its heartbeat.
