Pips Taylor examines why so many rape victims fail to receive justice in the UK. With powerful interviews with victims lawyers and police officers she explores who is to blame for this failure and discovers a system which favours the accused's right over those of the victim's. With a woman being raped every 10 minutes in the UK Pips decides that something needs to be done to change societal attitudes to rape and restore faith in the system to the thousands of victims of this heinous crime.
