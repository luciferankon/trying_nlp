Julian Mario and Cameron are three twenty-something guys who have it all together in their love life... or so they think. Friends since their college days these men have exchanged information on the best ways to meet pick up and date girls for years. So when Cameron catches his girlfriend cheating on him with another man in his own bed; Julian's woman calls him corny and leaves him for a supposedly stronger more aggressive man; and Mario's lady bounces because she is no longer willing to foot the financial bill of their relationship while waiting for him to get his act together; they decide they have had ENOUGH of the cruel trickery and heartless games women play. Enter Hamlin - master of all things "Alpha Male" who offers a course teaching men how to become dogs. With nothing to lose except their pitifully sad single status Julian Mario and Cameron simultaneously enroll in Hamlin's course hoping to flip the script and become victorious in their relationships. Each week they face new challenges individually and collectively. Although the guys may not always agree on Hamlin's methods one thing is sure: Cameron Julian and Mario will become stellar students perfecting the game as they learn the ins and outs of "How Men Become Dogs."
