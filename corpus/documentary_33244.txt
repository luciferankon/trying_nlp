Paule Baillargeon is 37 years old 11 years old 65 years old. . . In this film composed of fragments she tells her story: the story of a woman a filmmaker a mother a feminist an artist. Of an actress too who delivers a powerful narrative that is both soothing and unsettling. These potent images her images-filmed painted photographed drawn animated-merge into the portrait of a life that has been wild rebellious and gentle. The tableaux are not so much autobiography as an authentic tale as unpredictable and unique as any life.
