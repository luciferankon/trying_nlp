Brothers in Arms is the story of the lead up reasons and the repercussions of the "Milperra Massacre" where two warring Motorcycle Clubs faced off in the car park of a western Sydney pub on Fathers Day 1984. The two clubs the Bandidos and the Comancheros were once under one club only to later split which then caused a rift that would lead to many deaths. Whilst the show is "based" on real events there are inaccuracies that can easily be ignored and give the viewer an insight into not only the bikie (biker) culture but also one of the worst massacres in Australian history.
