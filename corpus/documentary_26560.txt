SOMATOGRAPHY echoes and investigates the imagined city as dual site of recall and forgetting a historical amnesia tenuously linked to a reinvention of the cities' metaphysical and material boundaries. Within SOMATOGRAPHY reside historical excavations and fantasy projections. Red Hill (Echo Park) The Gay Liberation Front Maxine Waters and the Radical Faeries are just some of the inhabitants who have gifted stories that re-imagine sexuality rebellion and voice as lived and deployed in urban traces.
