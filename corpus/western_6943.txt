A pretty school teacher (Lois Collier)---make that a very pretty school teacher--- a doctor (Don Porter) who disapproves of the white man's attitude toward Indians and a young Indian boy (Buzz Henry) do what they can in the modern west to keep Robert Wilcox and his henchies (the usual Universal suspects headed by Dick Curtis) from capturing and killing a wild horse herd so Wilcox can sell the hides. It all looks bigger than it is because director Wallace Fox makes liberal use via stock footage of the massive wild horse herds from Universal's 1936 "Stormy."
