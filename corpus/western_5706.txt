Brand controls the only road to the cattle market and is charging exorbitant rates. When Tim and Chito rob Brand to recover only their overcharge they accidently end up with all of Brand's money. So they give it to the ranchers who then give it back to Brand so they can move their cattle. But there is trouble when that money is then stolen and Brand's Clerk murdered.
