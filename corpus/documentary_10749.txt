This feature documentary profiles a key element of the 1990 Oka crisis in which the Mohawk communities of Kahnawake and Kanehsatake stood against the Canadian military and Canadian citizens in a stand-off that turned violent. On August 28 1990 a convoy of 75 cars left the Mohawk community of Kahnawake and crossed Montreal's Mercier Bridge-straight into an angry mob that pelted the vehicles with rocks. The targets of this violence were Mohawk women children and elders leaving Kahnawake in fear of a possible advance by the Canadian army. This film is the fourth in Alanis Obomsawin's landmark series on the Mohawk rebellions that shook Canada in 1990.
