Zanskar is a remote kingdom in the northwest Indian Himalaya where local people are snow-bound for six months of the year. About 10000 Zanskaris live in the isolated valley. In winter mountain passes are blocked the summer Jeep road closes and buses stop. Two decades ago three friends founded a ski school to enable winter transportation in the valley improve quality of life and to encourage young people to stay in Zanskar by promoting a culture of mountain sports. In 2015 the friends decide to expand the reach of the school a proven success so far to a neighboring town. Along the way they ponder a bigger question - how can Zanskar's wilderness be preserved while providing local people with employment and a motivation to stay? It is only a matter of time before the winter road is completed and the "Big India" rushes in.
