Memories...Then and Now was a syndicated weekly program that featured nostalgia and other features highlighting a bygone era. Two or three feature stories were presented each week; a typical show might include memories of Shirley Temple movies a 25-year reunion of an Army battalion company and an elderly couple who continue to successfully operate an old-fashioned soda fountain and lunch counter. Regular segments included use of high school and college yearbook photographs of famous people; use of old music and film/video clips to highlight a certain year; and a "Where Are They Now?" segment of past news-makers.
