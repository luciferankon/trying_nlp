A single father trying to keep his daughter from the world he navigates. Trying to keep her from a "Romeo and Juliet" relationship. Trying to keep his investors from the Cleveland and Pittsburgh families at ease while he puts his plan of "a resurgence of his hometown of Youngstown Ohio in motion". All of this while taking place in the world of the EDM culture. It's a chronicle of a man in extremis. It's a world he knows the streets he's navigated his whole life and the ones he may be buried on if he isn't careful !!!
