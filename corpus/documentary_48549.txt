Black Nation is a film that takes an uncompromising look at the state of Black manhood in America as seen through the prism of the streets of Detroit past and present and that city's controversial Church of the Black Madonna. Filmmaker Mats Hjelm draws on his deep personal connection with the Church and the City to explore the racial cultural and political ramifications of a "black male Genocide". Black Nation offers the audience a penetrating look at what it means to be a Black Man in America today.
