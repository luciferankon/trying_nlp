If talking about using a condom is tough to discuss with your hot and horny one-night stand try telling them you have genital herpes. This documentary is a light-hearted romp about ordinary Australians who've found themselves infected with the herpes virus. Recorded anonymously and visually represented by puppets characters candidly share the deeply intimate stories of how they were first caught with their pants down and the ensuing battles they've fought with their inner demons. Most importantly we'll listen to how they had to adapt to living and loving with an incurable and taboo virus. We'll learn that while our heroes have learnt the hard way herpes has taught them more about love sex and human relationships than they had ever anticipated.
