Cal and Aaron are two brothers whose relationship is clearly very troubled. Cal forms a friendship with a young man Cassius from a very different background (including the fact that he is African-American). When Aaron goads Cassius into a fight at a Christmas party and Cal stands by his newfound friend a series of events begins that exacerbates the tensions between the siblings into open hostility and finally real conflict.
