LOOSE ENDS is a collage film about the process of internalizing the information that bombards us through a combination of personal experience and media in all forms. Speeding through our senses in ever-increasing numbers and complicated mixtures of fantasy dream and reality from both outside and in these fragmented images of life sometimes shared by all sometimes isolated and obscure but with common threads lead us to a state of psychological entropy tending toward a uniform inertness ... an insensitive uninvolvement in the human condition and our own humanity.
