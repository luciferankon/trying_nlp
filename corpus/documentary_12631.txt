By the end of the summer of 2013 it began to emerge that the Parti Quebecois the political party in control of a minority government at the time was about to propose a discriminatory bill that would have banned people of ethnic backgrounds from adorning religious garb or symbols if they work in an environment that receives public funding under the guise of a "secular" charter in what was considered to be a strategic maneuver by the political party to gain a majority government in the next election by creating wedge politics and using a right wing approach to promote Quebec identity on unilateral nationalistic grounds at the expense of pluralism and multiculturalism. La charte des distractions is a documentary that critically examines the reasons behind the proposed bills and its failings.
