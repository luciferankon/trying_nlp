A shy nerd Bergie Barnsworth wants to audition for the new realty TV show Chance Of Your Life in hopes of dancing with the Asian pop star Lolli Pop.

Cast to perform with Lolli Pop Bergie's novelty gains international fame causing fellow competitor Maximus Sextus a one hit wonder to become insanely jealous and do what ever is necessary to take Bergie out of the competition.
