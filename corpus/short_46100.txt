The Eye Enters Life re-imagines the city symphony in a modern capacity. Using footage shot across five continents we were driven to ask: what would modern urban spaces look like next to each other? Would we recognize difference or would we recognize sameness? Would harmony or dissonance prevail? Using any recording devices available - video camcorders SLRs cell phones point-and-shoots - shooters explored the themes of humanism in the urban spaces around them. All footage was uploaded where collaborators could instantaneously see what footage was shot in Nice Beijing Cadiz St. Petersburg Capetown Reykjavik.
