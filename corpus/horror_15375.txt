London 2020: as the radioactive clouds begin to fade after a devastating nuclear war the last dregs of humanity fight to survive - drought and famine cripple this cracked broken world. Electricity is a thing of the past. Hideous mutants stalk the night desperately searching for food and warmth. A cold planet. A dying planet. Superstition is rife. Evil rises. Through the husk of the once great metropolis stalks a lone figure The Red Death: to some a God to others a freedom fighter to all a nightmare of agonising death. From the shell of a once great building all that remains of his empire corrupt billionaire Marzo rules what is left of London. His kill squads murder pillage and rape. His group of friends indulge in every excess. Yet neither money or power can save Marzo from the Red Death... and it is coming for him.
