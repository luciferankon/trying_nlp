This film is about my grandfather Michael Scherbak and his memories of being an Ost-Arbeiter (German for Eastern Worker) during World War II. He and his family were taken from Ukraine which at the time part of the USSR to work in slave-labor camps in Germany. When the filming began he had begun to develop dementia and Alzheimer's disease. This deconstruction of his memories became an integral element of the story.
