When 25-year-old engineer Jack Zylkin came across a vintage typewriter left curbside for the dump he couldn't allow such a spectacular machine to be trashed. After briefly displaying it on his mantelpiece he decided try to put it to use hauling it down to Hive76 a hackerspace he founded in downtown Philly. Their motto? "Make things awesome by making awesome things." Egged on by his tech-savvy buddies Zylkin soon developed the USB Typewriter a modified machine which leaves the typewriter looking feeling and working like a regular typewriter - attached to a contemporary computer. In his own words his invention is "a groundbreaking advancement in the field of obsolescence." With this new gadget Zylkin collides old technology with new offering an authentic vintage typewriting experience combined with a modern computer's functionality and convenience.
