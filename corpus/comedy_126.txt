Written Without Consent is a new sketch comedy show from TechNikkel Mass Productions in association with Arche Films. It's a unique blend of film music comedy and entertainment. Imagine going to a live show and enjoying stand-up comedy and your favorite local band all interspersed with hilarious skits on the big screen. There may even be a little magic. And when the live show is done you can go home and watch it on television just like any other sketch comedy show. That's Written Without Consent.
