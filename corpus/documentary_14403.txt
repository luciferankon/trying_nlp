Rather than submit to seduction by the Roman governor Quinziano the young Sicilian girl Agatha submitted to having her breasts cut off. She was canonized by the church and to this day inspires a devoted cult following. However the story of Saint Agatha remains untold by a female voice. Every version just like each year's festival has been crafted from a patriarchal point of view. Using both animation and real life characters from the streets and harbor of Catania Sicily Devoti tutti tells the story of Agatha's willingness to say "no" from a feminist point of view for the first time.
