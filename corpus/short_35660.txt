This short focuses on the prophecies of Nostradamus as they relate to Catherine de Medici who was the wife of Henry II King of France. She is pleased when she hears that each of her three sons will sit on a throne but events do not unfold as she expected. Toward the end the focus shifts to World War II and prophecies about who will be victorious. Catherine de Medici wife of King Henry II of France becomes obsessed with the prophecies written by Nostradamus especially as these prophecies may relate to the future of her three sons for whom she has plans of marriage leading into kingdoms of their own throughout Europe. When Catherine dismisses the negative prophecies Nostradamus has attributed to her family she instead wants solely to know if her sons will become kings and if she will live to see them all as kings. Nostradamus answers yes to both. In her seventieth year Catherine rereads the prophecies and reflects on their accuracies on her and her family's lives.
