Lejonjakten is one of five films (three of which are now lost) that were made by students at the University of Lund Sweden as a part of their 1908 carnival. The film is a cruel parody on Danish producer Ole Olsen's "LÅ™vejagten" (1907) which was at the time banned in Denmark (due to the fact that a lion and other animals were actually killed in the film) but shown in Sweden. In the student version two actors dressed up as a lion and a kangaroo get shot by hunters but the hunters themselves soon get arrested by the police an allusion to a recent conflict between the students and the local police. A lion and a kangaroo run around in a park. Two big game hunters and their black carrier pass through the shrubbery. When they see the animals they shoot them. They have problems pulling of the furs which obviously are only animal-costumes covering human bodies. A police force arrives at full speed on horses and on foot. As it's forbidden to hunt lions and kangaroos in this time of the year they arrest the hunters as well as the animals. The animals thank the hunters for a good hunt.
