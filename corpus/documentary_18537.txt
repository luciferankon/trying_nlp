Thirty years ago Sylvia Kristel became world-famous with 'Emmanuelle'. This erotic film was the starting point of a curious career during which Sylvia acted in more than 50 international film productions including a short-lived career in Hollywood. A turbulent life followed in which alcohol and drug addictions formed a recurring theme. Penniless she now lives in a small two-room apartment in Amsterdam. Last year La Kristel took stock of her life: her autobiography Nue was published in France and has already been sold to several countries. Director Michiel van Erp followed Sylvia Kristel. She looks back on her career and her life which two years ago suddenly changed when she was diagnosed with cancer of the throat and lungs. "Sylvia Kristel: Nu" is a portrait of an energetic self-willed film diva whose career has come to an end. Major film offers no longer come her way and for the main part Sylvia has to rely on the will to survive that she has made her own. More than ever perhaps she has to make use of her talent for happiness as she herself once described it. A life 'after the great successes' medical checkups and peculiar international media performances where time after time she talks about her time as 'Emmanuelle'.
