Contextualised by the country's past Born and Reared is firmly rooted in the Northern Ireland of today as the population struggles to come to terms with the horrors and the sacrifices of its past and the men turn to face a future defined by their hopes rather than regret. Filmed over a year with the men in and around their homes the filmmakers focused on the stories that took place long after the cameras had left the news story that was Northern Ireland. Thirty years of violence came to an end in a 1998 peace deal but the lives of those affected indirectly or otherwise by the so-called 'Troubles' continued.
