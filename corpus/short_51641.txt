Lacey is a girl of about ten. On a lazy day she watches some TV rides her bike in front of her house then explores a field across from her front door. A shirtless man pets her dog. She goes up to him and he bends close to take a bug off her shoulder and hand it to her. Is this an innocent or a dangerous world? Is Lacey in trouble?
