The movie conveys the confused and meandering world of a teenager trying to make sense out of new emotions and feelings. It is more like the diary of a flirt. Based on I wrote Your name in the sky by Nikhil Chandwani the movie is able to arouse the viewers interest at the very beginning by portraying a flirt who was unaware of the word 'flirt' itself. The universe of the teenager is so intense full of love lust romance broken hearts... it's fascinating movie and Chandwani has been able to portray all these emotions in his canvas. It is fast movie and full of interesting twists and turns and full of emotions the view is very familiar with.
