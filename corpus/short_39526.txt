While driving in the great American void a lonely traveling salesman is head shot by a stray bullet. At a nearby farmhouse a young single Christian mother and her 9-year-old daughter nurse the man back to consciousness and health. But the mother and daughter show their affections for the stranger in unexpected ways. While the girl confuses the invalid for her missing father her mother has more carnal plans. The girl's true memory of her father calls to her from the cathedral-like barn seeking to enact a vengeance to rival any Greek tragedy.
