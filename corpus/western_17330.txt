In the 1880s the town of Boyce's old sheriff Bill Dowdy retires. A vote is held to elect a new sheriff. Bill Dowdy encourages his younger friend Gregg Leech to run for the office. Also running for the job is the town's lawyer John W. Harmon. Gregg Leech is reluctant to become sheriff because he plans to marry his girlfriend Karen Childress. Gregg believes the sheriff job and the family-man role don't go together but Karen assures him that he can be sheriff and husband. Gregg is hesitant about it since his father and grandfather both ex sheriffs died in the line of duty. Nevertheless pressured by the retiring sheriff to run for office Gregg accepts and easily wins. However getting elected is one thing and being skilled as sheriff is another thing. Some townsfolk who voted for his opponent still hold a grudge against Gregg because they believe Gregg isn't man enough or brave enough to act as sheriff. Gregg's moment of truth approaches and he soon has a chance to prove himself capable of being a skilled lawman when three desperadoes ride into town. The three strangers claim they're there to kill the new sheriff. They are hired killers who accepted a contract to eliminate Gregg. He now faces the peril alone and he must do what the citizens elected him to do - keep the peace and enforce the law in town. The paid killers drinking in the local saloon send word to Gregg to leave town by 8 pm or be gunned down. With no help from the townsfolk Gregg must gather his courage and face the killers.
