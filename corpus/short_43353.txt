A look at Nate Wiley and his trio the Crowd Pleasers performing at Bob and Barbara's Lounge in Philadelphia: Nate on tenor Cliff Lamar on drums and Howard Candie on the Hammond B3. Each of the men talks a bit as the soundtrack plays their jazz. We see the club a bar really informal except for these three elegantly dressed older musicians. Pabst Blue Ribbon is the beer swing is the rhythm; the colors of the lounge are bright.
