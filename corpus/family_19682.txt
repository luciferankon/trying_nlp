One woman caught in the scandalous act of adultery; another rejected and ignored because of her promiscuous lifestyle; another shunned for twelve years because of a shameful condition; a widow cast out from society mourning the loss of her only son. An ugly thread of shame sorrow and hopelessness painfully weaves its way through the lives of each of these women. After following Jesus for three years Mary Magdalene observed all these things and more. Watching with amazement Mary learned from Jesus a new way to look at people. Mary Magdalene acts as both narrator and participant in "Magdalena: Released From Shame" as she traces through the story of lives that have come into contact with this man Jesus and have been powerfully released from shame. The Scriptures used in "Magdalena: Released from Shame" are taken from both the Good News and New International Version translations of the Bible.
