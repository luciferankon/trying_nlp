When Liz Shaw returns from a working holiday in Spain a new and deeply disturbing case awaits. Corporal 7891Alpha has outlived his usefulness or rather the government can no longer afford to fund the medication. And that can mean only one thing... termination! At first glance a 'government authorised execution' is a simple enough task for the Preternatural Research Bureau (PROBE) team.
