When the Government incorporates Bill Hayden's ( Tom Lingham ) ranch into a Federal game preserve Jack McCabe ( Art Acord ) a forest ranger is sent to serve an eviction notice on Hayden and his daughter Shasta ( Marguerite Clayton ). Hayden resists the order and Jack falls in love with Shasta. Whitey Durk ( Duke R. Lee ) steals Hayden's cattle and pins the blame on Jack. The burly ranger later rescues Hayden and Shasta from Duke's men and brings the bandits into court. The law establishing the game preserve is repealed and Shasta confesses her love for Jack.
