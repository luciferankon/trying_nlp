Lani's Story follows a woman's experience of two relationships - one she has to escape to survive the other she cannot survive without. It is a moving and intimate portrait of a young Aboriginal woman's journey from victim to victor from a broken and violent relationship to discovering the redemptive power of love. Lani's Story also explores the impact of inter-generational violence within a family and community and how the courage of one person can transform the lives of others.
