The delicate relationship between a 15-year-old girl and her grandfather is used to describe how the growing political tensions between Muslems and Hindus in 1992 led to the destruction of a medieval Muslim mosque and subsequently violent rioting in the streets of Bombay. Naseem (urdu: sahar) means Morning breeze and charts the story of a young school going girl Naseem in the months leading up to the demolition of Babri Masjid in 1992. She shares deep and loving bond with his ill grandfather who represents the era of communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims in India as he fondly recalls the times he spent in pre-Independent Agra. As communal tension erupts in the city of Bombay Naseem get increasingly bewildered by changing dynamics at her school and in the neighborhood while her grandfather watches helplessly at a city getting deeply divided over the Babri Masjid issue.
