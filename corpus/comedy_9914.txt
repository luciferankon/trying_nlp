Ann a 19-year-old girl who looks much younger meets a dashing army major on a boat sailing from Liverpool to Bombay India and falls in love with him. Her love appears to be unrequited though because the major thinks she is far too young--and also unknown to her because he had once been in love with her mother. When a fellow passenger on the ship takes advantage of the naive girl the major comes to her rescue but in the process the girl finds out about the past relationship between he and her mother.
