For more than 160 years little was known about the forgotten Swiss immigrants of the Colony Dona Francisca in southern Brazil. Many of the Swiss descendants thought mistakenly until very recently that they were of German descent. Even today in Switzerland many are unaware that their ancestors had immigrated to Brazil in search of a better life. Shot in these two countries with an international cast the film tells the moving saga of those brave families blending fictional narrative with documentary style.
