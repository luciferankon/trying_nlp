A small island in the Libyan Sea. A frontier. A place of exile. A hidden refuge. For some the legendary Homeric Ogygia island of the nymph Calypso where Odysseus remained for seven years before returning to Ithaca. The southernmost point of Europe where people from different homelands and backgrounds coexist. Locals who have lived "unseen" lives and are now trying to balance between progress and the ways of the past. "Self-exiled" romantics who have found "Ithaca" in a remote lost paradise. Two worlds that despite their differences coexist and share the same concern for the island's future. A community facing the same problems of everyday life while setting an example of solidarity against economic competition and individualism.
