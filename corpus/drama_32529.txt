A seminal reformist melodrama critiquing the zamindari system from the viewpoint of the Kisan Sabha agitations in A.P. Small-time landowner Narsi Reddy (Raghawan) borrows money from a shavukar [money-lender (Raghavan)] who represents the major zamindar (Sitapathy) of the village. When Narsi Reddy votes for a peasant candidate (Kosaraju) rather than for the political party supported by the landlord his son is attacked and he is publicly humiliated.
