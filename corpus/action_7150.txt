In the Old World there is an older tale to be told inside the Necroland universe. Dr. David McDonald becomes a reluctant soldier and leader of the S.E.T. (Subterranean Exploration Team) under the Isle of Skye in Scotland. Something more devious and from another time has reared its Necrit head showing what seems to be the origins of the cataclysmic international chaos currently running amok. The American team eventually makes contact from the original film "Necroland" created by Iron Core Media.
