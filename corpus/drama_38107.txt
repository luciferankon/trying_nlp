A film of the award winning live theatre production The List. Set in Qu√©bec The List is the story of a woman struggling to adjust to rural life. Increasingly isolated she keeps life in order through obsessive list making. As her marriage struggles she befriends Caroline. When Caroline requests a favour she adds it to her list. The difference between remembering to do it and neglecting to take it seriously becomes the difference between life and death. The List transforms the intimacy of live theatre directly onto the big screen. In 2013 Stellar Quines set out to discover how a mid scale theatre company can reach a larger audience in the cinema something big players like the Met Opera have had conspicuous success with but which until now has been beyond the reach of Scottish theatre companies.Restaging their award-winning Edinburgh Festival Fringe production The List Stellar Quines commissioned BAFTA-winning film director Morag McKinnon to work alongside stage director Muriel Romanes to produce a cinema version of the play. Their aim was to create a filmed experience that didn't compromise the liveness and intimacy of the actor's relationship with an audience.
