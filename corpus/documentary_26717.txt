A hundred years ago the Constitutionalist Army -the origin of current Mexican Army- played a decisive role in returning the country loss legality at the hands of the usurper President Victoriano Huerta. In a difficult process those revolutionary militias acquired the values of professionalism and institutional loyalty that have distinguished it during its long history. Today the Mexican Army is similar to it predecessor but is also different; it maintains its popular roots and its desire to contribute to a freer and more fair country but is distinct for its educational solidity and its attachment to democratic values that distinguish Mexico in the 21st century.
