The Butterfly Beat is based in a world in which the Romans never left Albion and the population are under the thrall of faceless bureaucrats in Strasbourg Attica and Roma. Legionaries from The Holy Roman Empire of Europa patrol the streets in cahoots with the local police affectionately known as 'flics'. Flics are not unaverse to a little torture now and again to keep the hoi-polloi on their toes. Within this dystopian world a group of very ordinary teenagers are trying to make sense of growing up with a little help from their mums and no help at all from their absent dads. A group of activists known as The Sons of Parnassus are busy burning down fast food outlets and a serial killer is on the loose at nightclubs and rock concerts where there have already been 69 deaths due to the so-called Disco Virus. D.C.I Winston Molloy of WASP the West Anglia Saxon Police is getting nowhere with his enquiries and had resorted to arresting and torturing innocent bystanders in a desperate attempt to find a lead. But Cindy Kiss and Isabel Karlin two newsreaders on the West Anglia Saxon news aren't interested in any of that they are too busy building up their adult dating site Hookbuddy. They have seen a gap in the market and they mean to exploit it and get rich.
