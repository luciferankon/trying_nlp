The Amazing Legacy of Turner High is the telling of few of many stories of triumph and achievement that emerged from the hallowed halls of H.M. Turner High School of Atlanta Georgia. Opened in 1951 the school was a school for "Negro" children during the days of segregation in the deep south. But what was meant to hold back and separate would inspire generation after generation of students and help shape the inclusion of the world at large. Graduates of this segregated public school would become the first to integrate universities businesses employment governments and other institutions of the South.
