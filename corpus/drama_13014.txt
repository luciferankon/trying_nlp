The autumn of 1943. Katya goes to the partisan detachment. The people at the detachment are aware that someone is betraying them. The traitor is their go-between in the town. The partisans Ivan and Hristo go to the town along with Katya to prevent him from betraying them again. They must cross the bridge over the river but the police are checking everybody's identity papers. They swim across the river but on the opposite bank they come face to face with a company of soldiers. Shooting breaks out. Hristo is badly wounded. He is apprehended and tortured. He dies in his cell. Katya and Ivan take refuge in the attic of a deserted house where they spend the night and the following day. The two must take the risk. They leave their hiding place. The traitor is also on his way to the meeting place but they manage to warn his friend who escapes. Ivan and Katya must part. The words that two young people in love might have said remain unuttered.
