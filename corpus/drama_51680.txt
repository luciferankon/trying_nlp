This film tells the story of a group of children whose lives are inexorably bound up with Sampaguita the national flower of Philippines and the myths that surround it. Sampaguita blossoms are much sought-after but since they wilt quickly they must be sold within twenty-four hours. All the children in this film are are all sampaguita pickers or sellers.
