A documentary capturing bboying often called breakdancing as a true art form. The film explores what happens when bboys are taken out of competitions staged performances and movies. While answering the question "what is bboying?" the documentary combines stunning landscapes and explosive dancing to engage the audience into what bboying has become since the 1980s. The documentary is presented in a way that is more relatable to a non-bboy audience to identify with the bboys filmed whether they identify with the city the bboy is from or the environments they dance in. Through this documentary we hope to share our passion with the audience and show them the true essence of bboying.
