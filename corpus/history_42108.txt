By the summer of 1900 Galveston Texas was one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States and its citizens were full of optimism as the 20th century approached. One of those citizens was Isaac Cline appointed a decade earlier to head the U.S. Weather Bureau office in Galveston. But on September 8 of that year a Category 4 hurricane washed away most of the city and claimed more than 6000 lives--still the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. This documentary focuses on Isaac Cline's role in the disaster: was he (as local legend has it) a heroic figure who saved lives by warning the population to flee or did scientific hubris prevent him from seeing the danger until it was too late?
