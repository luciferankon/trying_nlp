Advocate Gautam Mehra lives in Bombay with his wife Anju and a daughter Rakhsa. One day while returning from court he sees a woman being molested. He stops phones the police and then tries to stop the molester in vain though as himself gets attacked and loses consciousness. But the police do arrive and arrest the molester. Raghuvir's attempts to convince Gautam to change his testimony are in vain. Gautam goes on to testify against Raghuvir Singh and gets him sentenced to seven years rigorous prison. Six years later Raghuvir re-enters the lives of the Mehras and he is not going to disappear until he has had his vengeance against all three. Efforts to stop him through the police are in vain as he has not committed any crime yet. The Mehras decide to re-locate to their farm house near a lake without notifying anyone. While they are being re-located Gautam finds out that it is not just Raghuvir who is out for vengeance - there is someone other than him who wants them dead.
