Simon Goulet looks for the reasons so many boys drop out of school. Inspired by Serge Goyette who helped him make sense of school 30 years ago director Simon Goulet wants to find out why so many more boys than girls drop out of high school in Quebec. Drop-outs drop-back-ins parents teachers and specialists take a hard look at the topic and do some serious damage to a number of sacred cows. Filmed in the style of a debate A Guy's a Guy! is both deeply moving and very funny. But above all it starts a conversation on the language of boys and explores ways we can join in.
