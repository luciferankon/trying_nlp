Little Feat recorded a live album from gigs at the Rainbow Theatre in London and Lisner Auditorium in Washington DC. "Waiting for Columbus" is considered by many rock music critics to be one of the best live albums of all time despite the fact that significant portions of Lowell George's vocals and slide guitar work were over-dubbed later in the studio. "Waiting for Columbus" was released in 1978 by which time it had become apparent that Lowell George's interest in the band was waning as was his health.
