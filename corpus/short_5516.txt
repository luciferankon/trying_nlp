Thus I Travel talks about the kind of transformation traveling can bring in human lives. It is the story of a travel filmmaker who traveled across India to understand that the crux of life is to accept other people regardless of their cultures languages ethnicities or religions. He talks about the kind of experiences he had when staying with strangers in his journey and answers the question as to why one has to travel.
