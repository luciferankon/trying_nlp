After the turbulent years of the Greek Junta Greece was seeking an identity and one way to accomplish this task was to develop its tourism. As a result a new type of male was born the archetypal Greek Lover or "Spear" who used to target young female tourists with the intention of a passionate one-night stand. With this in mind the "Spears" came mainly from the petite bourgeoisie class they only knew some broken English and they shared a very specific dress code. During this vivid documentary we will meet a handful of those intrepid "Colossi of Love" such as Bruno a love-making machine John owner of the legendary disco "Highway" George aka "Cement" and Takis a hot DJ. They were the indefatigable hunters of love and they were proud of their achievements.
