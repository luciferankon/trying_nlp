Dallas McKay is your average 20-something newspaper reporter: Single liberal and unabashedly atheist. When a truck smacks into him in a bar parking lot he wakes up in Heaven and - after uttering a few choice profanities - finds himself face-to-face with the God he doesn't believe exists. But God isn't out for vengeance; She's concerned that Her message has been lost in a swarm of religious zealotry and sends Dallas back to Earth to write and sell a new improved religious text.
