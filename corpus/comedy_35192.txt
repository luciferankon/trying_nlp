A small town multiplex is turned upside down when a famous Hollywood director Simona Wakefield is rumored to be sneaking into a special screening of her new film. The workers of Cinema 14 divide up in two opposing factions: the first led by Rocky an aspiring young filmmaker who wants to impress Wakefield and get a recommendation to film school. The other led by Wade an anarchist wheelchair bound ticket-taker who wants to 'smash the machinery of storytelling' and sabotage the sneak preview. Everyone in the theater is on the lookout for Ms. Wakefield; finding her however proves to be a harder task than anyone realizes.
