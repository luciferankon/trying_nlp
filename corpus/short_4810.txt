An old photograph forms the starting point of my exploration. The picture must have been taken towards the end of the 19th century at a time when film had just been invented and pictures were only starting to move. Its origins date back to a phase of transition between the still and the moving image. By creating a wide variety of duplications of a single image I am trying to translate it into the temporal and contemporary nature of film.
