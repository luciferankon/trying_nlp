A one-off special starring Benny Hill filmed entirely in Australia. Among the highlights: "Hold Back the Wind" yet another of his Tennessee Williams parodies; "Archie's Angels" a takeoff on "Charlie's Angels"; a sketch of two men who tended to Lady Godiva's horse; and in a concession to his filming location the saga of Benny Kelly son of outlaw Ned Kelly.
