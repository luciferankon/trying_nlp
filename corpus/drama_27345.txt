Victoria Ocampo the Argentine author critic and publisher of Sur magazine is described as having four faces: the cosmopolitan who looked toward Europe; the Argentinian who focused on her home in San Isidro Argentina; the American in Europe; and the European of the Americas. Among her works was "Emily Bronte; (terra incognita)." She met Calcutta-born Rabindranath Tagore the Nobel laureate poet/writer in 1921 and corresponded with him thereafter.
