In a small gym in town near Tel-Aviv a group of people meet-up once a week. To sit in a circle and talk about their life. They are not alcoholics anonymous they are not an anger management group or cult. Their only link is the way in which their life was disruptive. They are all - Social media victims. Normal ordinary people that their life turned up-side-down the moment their privacy and intimate life were exposed to make a mockery out of them. Overnight celebrities of negativity. They are all part of an alternative support group - for people who have gone through shaming experience over the web.
