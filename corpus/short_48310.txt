An exceptionally clever series of optical illusions in which a basket of eggs and the chef take prominent parts. The chef gets a few ideas on the mysteries of the culinary art and is stupefied by a veritable storm of eggs. Intensely interesting amusing and very mystifying. Artistically colored throughout.
