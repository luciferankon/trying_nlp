Existing through the early stages of civilization this object was actually the virtual prison for the raw energies of the Radiant and Dire vying for control within the confines of the "Mad Moon".

The energies of the Radiant and Dire attracted creatures of different alignments and unified under these factions the battles of Dota would commence.
