A feature film shot bit by bit over 30 years reflecting alienation longing fear escape with an experimental approach to style and narrative. A visual personal journey from when I left Baghdad at age 17 the stills and films becoming my diary recording my nightmares my feelings looking for a homeland that was so far removed by fear and wars. The style of the film is proof of my experiencing the world through my camera I am a witness throughout my exile.
