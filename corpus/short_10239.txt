Armenian Lullaby is based on the verse of my great-great-grandfather Rafael Patkanian (1830-1892) about a mother who is singing a lullaby to her child calling on different birds who are associated with various professions. The baby falls asleep only to the song of Falcon who is singing battle songs in other words chooses the profession of a soldier. Traditionally it's considered a patriotic song: in the country that survived genocide Soviet regime and recent war with Azerbaijan sons' primary vocation is to become soldiers. This interpretation is dedicated to Mothers of all soldiers.
