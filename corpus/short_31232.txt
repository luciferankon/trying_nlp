Dave and Al drive to the desert for a night of camping away from it all. As quickly as they establish rules for the trip a hitchhiker climbs aboard with some ideas of her own. Under the cover of night Jen entices the boys to help her with some risky business. Al proves a natural but things get complicated when Dave feels the gravity of what they've done.
