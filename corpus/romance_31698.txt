An American adventure seen through the eyes of a French girl in love. A road trip down a dangerous Nuclear Highway where reality is perception and salesmen and thieves are indistinguishable. The journey may seem doomed but love prevails and the greatest blessings are in the full moon shining in the desert love and the longing of dreamers for the rising sun and the birth of a new day.
