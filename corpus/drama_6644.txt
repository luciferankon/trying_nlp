Amidst the swirl of Tokyo's seamy nightlife of designer drugs casual sex and American slang Zhou turns 30. It's a spiritual crisis for this Chinese immigrant who quotes Confucius this Lothario and con artist who fences stolen goods. He falls for Kyoko a seemingly shy provincial woman looking for the man who jilted her sister. As their relationship plays out Hanawa intercuts stories of Kazuo a hyper- kinetic artist who loves the trendy Yoko (Kazuo bores her and she pursues the indifferent Zhou) and Ali a Pakistani Muslim who broke and forlorn stands outside a convenience store love-struck by a clerk because she looked into his eyes (she thought he was shop-lifting).
