Jan Bosdriesz' father was a fanatical collector of gramophone records. Most exotic and romantic were the records by the Russian singer: Pyotr Leshchenko popular Russian singer from the nineteen thirties and forties. Banned yet heard everywhere. Eventually he died in a Romanian work camp. Archive footage also reveals tangibly yet en passant something of the gruesome history of the 1930s and 1940s in Eastern Europe. During his research trip Jan Bosdriesz was however repeatedly confronted with memories of the family he grew up in. That in turn became an important part of the film.
