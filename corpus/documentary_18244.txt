This is the Africa you have never seen - not even in your wildest dreams. Saba Douglas-Hamilton travels way off the beaten path to three African countries which are not on the tourist map. The Comoros Islands a lost world of volcanoes living fossils and legendary flying foxes. An extreme road trip into Angola a country just emerging from one of the world's worst civil wars to see if any of its wildlife has survived. And the jungles of the Central African Republic.
