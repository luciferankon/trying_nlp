This short-lived attempt to revive live comedy on Channel 7 was a combination of interviews popular culture trivia and topical current affairs with a light hearted bent. The program was equally hosted by all the those credited in the cast although Richard Stubbs took a leading role. The program was initially the second half hour in an hour and was preceded by a woefully bad 'The Big News'. Soon however 'The Big News' was axed and 'The Late Report' took over the entire hour.
