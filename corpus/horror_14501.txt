When Oscar is fired and her boyfriend walks out (taking the cat) she heads to a remote cabin in the woods outside a ghost town called TARNATION. Here she plans to reflect on her life choices. Unfortunately for Oscar the woods are home to a DEMON UNICORN whose satanic master seeks Oscar's blood to complete a ritual that will raise SATAN HIMSELF from Hell. Oscar is thrown into a battle with a demonic force that can possess anyone and anything living in the woods. Oscar must fight for her life and ultimately face the evil in her own soul to stop TARNATION falling upon the world.
