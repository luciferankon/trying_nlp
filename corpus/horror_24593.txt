American documentarist John Gillespie and his crew travel to Turkey to shoot a docufilm about Vlad Tepes the Romanian Emperor known as Vlad the Impaler. Tepes was imprisoned in Turkey for a number of years before dying on the battlefield in his native country. His body was brought back to Istanbul and buried somewhere... Or so the legend says. During their research John and his crew are introduced to a mysterious historian who claims to have evidence of Tepes' burial site. Things take an unexpected twist when the Americans run into a sinister story of children that were abducted and brutally sacrificed in a village not too far from Istanbul. Apparently the very same place where Vlad had been kept prisoner prior to his death... John is skeptical but agrees to investigate further. And thus begins his journey to Garip. The village of ghosts. The place where it all began and where all will end...
