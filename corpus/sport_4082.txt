During the 2008 Cauliflower Alley Club annual meeting in Las Vegas several of the future stars of professional wrestling showed their stuff in front of and sometimes accompanied by the sports greatest legends. The event was highlighted by Pro Wrestling Noah's Go Shiozaki taking on NWA Pro Wrestling Revolution's Oliver John. That and much more exciting action!
