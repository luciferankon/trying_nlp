Shot on the island of Lanzarote Proposal for an unmade film (set in the future) weaves together the extraordinary shattered volcanic landscape of the Timonfaya National Park and the 'retro-futuristic' utopian architecture of artist Cesar Manrique. Proposal... implies that it is assembled from 'location recce' and audition footage; the by-product of a pre-production process for a low budget science fiction film/architectural documentary developed this far abandoned and only later discovered in an archive. The suggested narrative that emerges from this found footage is that of a visitor attempting to create a paradise on earth - a story apparently influenced by Nick Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth - in which volcanic bubbles become time capsules buildings become space ships and sculptural mobiles become radio antenna.
