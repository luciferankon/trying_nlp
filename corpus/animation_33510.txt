Kniamons are Prehistoric creatures with special abilities existing long before the dinosaurs. They were recreated from the fossils long ago in a lab in the 1950's. After the lab burnt down years ago they were in Reserves until two teenage guys Nick and Justin began to capture the Kniamons and forge their abilities into their Android Kniamons. Three girls Tokia Charlotte and Chrissy rose up to protect the Kniamons from those creepy guys. With the help of three different stars containing three different gems they transform to fight them.
