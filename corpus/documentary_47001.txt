ATOUSA is the story of a young Iranian woman whose childhood begins in the ashes of the bloody Iran/Iraq war. Her journey takes her to the USA where ironically she becomes a "prisoner" in her own home. Much of her story is told to us from the security of a "safe house". Now Atousa is determined to help other women who find themselves in the same situation from which she ultimately freed herself.
