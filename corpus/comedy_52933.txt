A morally and emotionally bankrupt gossip columnist Will Rawlings is sent to the countryside by his editor to cover the wedding of the century. Life and a flock of sheep however have other plans for him and through a series of hilarious mishaps he winds up at the estate of the famously land rich cash poor Lord and Lady Clybourne. Mistaking him for a charity case the eccentric family takes him in. Seeing the possibility for an exclusive Will stays on keeping his true identity a secret yet finds himself falling head over heels in love with the Lord and Lady's fiery eldest daughter Emma and is thus faced with a major dilemma -- to write or not to write.
