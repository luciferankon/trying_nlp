A bunch of strangers barricade themselves in a farmhouse during a zombie uprising. Sound familiar? It should! Director Alan Smithee takes us on an irreverent (and unauthorized) romp through George A. Romero's classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD the film that spawned the modern zombie craze and a thousand "of the living dead" remakes and rip-offs (like this one). Smithee's new characters and dialogue and a healthy dose of nudity and adult language put a fresh spin on one of the best known films of all time!
