Abalimi - a word meaning "The Planters" - is a short documentary about Xhosa women growing organic vegetables in extremely harsh conditions in townships outside of Cape Town South Africa. Growing their own food helps them lift their families out of extreme poverty and is helping to spark a micro-farming revolution in their communities. The vegetables not used by the communities are sold to people outside of the townships creating income for the gardeners and further helping to improve their lives. It is a story about how re-learning the basic roots of agriculture has led these women onto a path towards individual food security. This movement could result in these poverty-stricken women winning back their basic human rights.
