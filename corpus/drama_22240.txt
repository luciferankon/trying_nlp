It follows the story of Matt right after he comes out of a five year relationship with his boyfriend Kyle into the new way of dating with mediums such as apps online dating and the unwritten rules of surviving in the gay community. Luckily his best friend Damien is on hand to help him. Damien knows a thing or two about successfully navigating the gay scene so with his help Matt gets involved. He writes about his experiences on his blog and along with a break up fresh in his mind he has to discover what love is all over again. This campaign is important to us as a team as it will help us to break the barrier of 'LGBT' stereotypes. It's our goal to show another side to a mostly unknown world and will hopefully give other LGBT members a show that they can enjoy and hopefully relate to in terms of the situations that our characters find themselves in.
