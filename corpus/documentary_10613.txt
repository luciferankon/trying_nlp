In this program we come to know the history of two teachers in rural Mexico who recently were awarded he Manuel Altamirano Medal for the more than fifty years of service they have provided. The teacher Jorge Gordillo was born and raised in a small community in Chiapas and inherited his vocation for teaching from his grandfather and father. On the other hand Guadalupe Aguińaga who is from a small town located at the foot of the Popocatépetl volcano decided to become a teacher because for her children - her students - are her life. Each one of them as well as some of their family members and people close to them stitch together the stories of their lives. They recall the memories of the hundreds of students whom they taught and who over time went on to become successful professionals. Through their stories Jorge and Lupita relive intimate moments of their past.
