Agata is in her forties she lives in an isolated farmhouse in the sole company of the animals that she stuffs by profession. She is a taxidermist. A metal cylinder sparkles white like icing in her living room: it is a strange and unidentifiable object fortuitously arrived in a package delivered by a courier. Agata needs to analyze the content of the package and the instruction booklet before realizing that the object is a cryogenic semen container that comes with a do-it-yourself insemination kit. The fate of Agata and that of the cylinder become one and together they set out for unexplored paths without a clear idea of what is going to happen.
