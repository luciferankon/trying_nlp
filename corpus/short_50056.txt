THE DC FIVE MEMORIAL FILM is structured in five sections: a young man writhing in ecstasy in a deserted house in Massachusetts; rephotographed home movies of my childhood in 1953 Connecticut; footage shot at my farm in upstate New York in the summer of 1969 as some friends of mine share cigarettes in the woods; a party at the Sanctuary Discotheque in the summer of 1969 photographed using the same reel of color film reloaded into the camera at least seven or eight times; and finally the apotheosis of the work in which a group of young women arms linked walk through the Port Authority Bus Terminal in the dead of night.
