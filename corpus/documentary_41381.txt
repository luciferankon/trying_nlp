In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina hundreds of thousands were left homeless in the Gulf region. So how can the rest of the nation help? This special episode of "Some Assembly Required" tells the story of how Habitat for Humanity volunteers from across the country gathered on the National Mall in Washington DC to frame up 51 homes prefab style in an event called "Operation Home Delivery". The show follows build leader Jillian Gross as she follows one of her homes to Louisiana. There in a 6-day blitz build she and other Habitat volunteers construct a new home for the Carrington family - who had been left devastated by last year's hurricanes.
