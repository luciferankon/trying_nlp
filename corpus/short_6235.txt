Celebrates the small airport in rural and small-town America. It looks at the many uses and benefits of a community airport: for commerce and industry for farmers and ranchers for government services and for recreation. One-third of America lives in or near small towns (2500 people or fewer) and these areas need an airport to flourish. Fighting wildfires fixing farm equipment brining in seed and fertilizers and dealing with local emergencies are all aided by a community airport. All that's needed is about 15 to 40 level acres a good landing strip and a plane. The United States has 7000 airports and soon will have more: the air is the greatest freeway says the narrator.
