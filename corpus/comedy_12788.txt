Popular Osaka-based all-girls' idol group NMB48 -- the third iteration of Yasushi Akimoto's highly successful AKB48 & 48 Family j-pop franchise billed as the largest pop-group in the world and heralded in Japan as "Idols you can meet" encompasses over half a dozen affiliated girl groups based in major cities throughout Japan and Asia with 300+ active female members (in addition to 300 "graduated" or retired members now ensconced in solo careers of their own) ranging in age from 11-28 -- has proven yet again that the 'triple threat' i.e. the idol who can sing dance and now act -- is the veritable gamechanger and industry standard in the iffy world of Japanese idols and talento. Now out with a movie of their own NMB48 is out to prove their acting chops -- i.e. as long as they get to play themselves or characters very much like themselves. For NMB48 whose ages ranged between 14-20 in this 2013 movie that means delimiting themselves only to roles that they can pull offf convincingly with little or no effort never mind imagination. And in the 48-Family group world that means high school girls playing high school girls. Enter this movie which translates to "NMB48 Entertainers! The Movie: high school comedy girls!"
