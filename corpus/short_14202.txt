Tyttö (girl) played to excess by an underage Katri Naukkarinen journeys through mysterious architectural trappings haunted by the hytkyjät (wigglers) physically attractive but psychologically misshapen creatures. After watching them perform a ritualized show of intimidation and cruelty she adopts a nonhuman infant called Parkakäsi (Wretchedhand). She first treats it with a mother's caring but then callously uses it as currency in a shady drug deal. The ending in its bleak resignation is pure zeitgeist.
