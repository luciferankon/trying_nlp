Hilarious comedy highlighting most amongst other issues the class difference in parts of Iran especially Tehran. The son of an old-fashioned 'Khan' falls in love with the daughter of the 'common' owner of the company he works for. They marry and the families meet with funny consequences. Side issues include the blatant advertising of products on the show constant talk of how to save gas and oil the speed of the pickpocket slave Heyfe Noon the bickering between the narrator and Kamran Mansoor's loss of memory and the intense love/hate relationship between the two sister-in-laws.
