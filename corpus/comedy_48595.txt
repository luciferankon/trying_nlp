#RichKids of New York features a whole different kind of "rich kid." These 16-somethings are just as wealthy famous and fabulous but with their own unique entrepreneurial drive. These RichKids are using their bank roll to build up their empires in the city. They're educated elitist and connected; reigning over a city where it's not just what you own but who you know. Despite their east coast pedigrees and privilege these rich kids are brash who love to party and make fun of themselves and each other.
