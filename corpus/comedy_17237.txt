Sorting through the best and worst viral videos is a big job; a big horrible mind-numbing job. Can you imagine having to do that yourself? Luckily host Matt Arden and our crew of writers judge the bad videos so you don't have to. Every weekday on tbs.com you can find new episodes of Today's Riff filled with hilarious clips and interviews with your favorite comedians. When a douchebag accidentally lights himself on fire we'll be there. When a cat plays a keyboard we'll be there. When a creepy infomercial haunts your dreams we'll be there. We find it mock it and serve it up fresh every day. It's just what we do.
