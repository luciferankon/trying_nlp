In the Spring of 2006 I traveled back to the small town I grew up in in Virginia to shoot a documentary about how my hometown had changed. It had been 12 years since I lived in Harrisonburg a small town founded in 1779 in the Shenandoah Valley. But I had visited many times and each time I saw that something more had been lost. Like many small towns across the U.S. Harrisonburg VA is struggling through rapid development. Few areas of the city remain untouched by the combination of factors conspiring to change Harrisonburg. Even though I now lived hundreds of miles from my hometown I felt a personal loss. I first felt this loss when the house I was brought home to as a newborn was torn down along with those of all the neighbors I had grown up with in order to accommodate several parking lots and office buildings for JMU. Now my actual street Patterson St. is as I write being removed from the map of the city due to the building of a new academic building for the campus across the street's former entrance. My high school had been leased to JMU; the hospital I was born in has been sold to them as well. Also long time residents I knew were chafing against the changes and felt alienated in their own city. This was the backdrop against which I shot 40 plus interviews with a diverse group of city residents--some supportive of the changes some against most bewildered and uncertain about them and also feeling the loss I felt.
