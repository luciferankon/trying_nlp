The volume of arms seized or turned in and annually destroyed by Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg's arms disposal service is said to be measured in tons. It's a measure taken to minimize violence or at least "opportunity" - such as the one taken by a 17-year-old boy in March 2009 when he took his father's gun to his former school and killed 15 people. Jana Schober and Selina Marx were among the victims. Jana's father and Selina's mother have been actively working to support the destruction of firearms ever since. The amateur shooters hunters and gun collectors though are rather sceptical sometimes even angry about this so-called "review of Winnenden". And then there is the local gunsmith who makes excellent precision firearms and suffers because nowadays his profession is more despised than a prostitute's. Thomas Lauterbach takes a close look at the personal concerns of his protagonists giving us extraordinary insights into the different perspectives on the issue. His film examines very diverse facets of the question of guilt and responsibility. But above all he finds astonishing ways to shake up a specific view of life.
