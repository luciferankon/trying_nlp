With poetry humour intimacy and compassion Doormat combines lyrical animation with documentary to chart the journey of an ordinary household doormat and immerses us in the lives of four individuals who work along its production path. A doormat factory owner wonders whether the frantic race to become #1 is slipping his life away; a production manager yearns to write poetry and escape the drudgery of his menial job; a coconut tree climber mourns the estrangement from a family that has disowned him because of his lowly status and a single mom makes endless sacrifices to give her son the chance she never had. At one point we all wonder whether we are doing our best with the short time of our lives. Doormat connects us with those far away who toil to make the household goods we barely notice and who have the very same questions.
