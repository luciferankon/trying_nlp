Tine is a journalist but without a permanent position often poorly paid. On the day her boyfriend Frank is moving to another continent for a new job she discoveres that he had cheated on her. As a revenge she writes an essey titled "My little dick" under his (Frank's) name and sends it to a trendy men's magazine. The publishing director Dagmar is so excited that she wants to hire Frank. Since Tine does not want to burst her biggest dream plus she really needs money she disguises herself as a man and takes on the job. But things gets more serious when editorial director Moritz (Tom Wlaschiha) offers her more permament job. Unfortunately she falls in love with him.
