The Guardian is a free interpretation of the parable "Before the Law" from Kafka's book "The Trial". A peasant after traveling the world arrives in front of a gate controlled by a fearsome Guardian. The peasant tries to pass through but the Guardian denies him entrance. Peasant and Guardian are the same character the peasant like each one of us in front of his own fear; the guardian something shapeless that surround and control him. the Door/Gate the possibilities we encounter during our life.
