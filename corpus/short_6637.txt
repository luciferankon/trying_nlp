Audiovisual rhetoric and grammar can be used as new formats to offer thinking tools. In the midst of the excess of images and information the split screen gives us the possibility of opening new systems of relationships between existing images. These dialectics are the legacy of Aby Warburg (Atlas Mnemosyne) John Berger's (Ways of Seeing) or Daniel Dennett's lectures. I AM C√ÅMARA (the CCCB program) makes the leap to the network and one of its missions is to show us how we can break through existing images based on shared authorship and the exchange of views.
