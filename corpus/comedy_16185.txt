A villager named Valentýna ('Barbora Hrzánová' (qv)) gets mixed up with the Prague underworld and at the same time finds love with a clumsy policeman ('Radek Holub' (qv)). 'Zdenek Tyc' (qv)'s third feature is a satiric improvised comedy with a taste of refreshing humor. Drawing on a carpe diem philosophy the film revels in an all-embracing joyfully ridiculous spirit which disregards generic and logical limits.
