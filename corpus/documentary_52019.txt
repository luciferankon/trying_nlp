One night Majella O'Donnell took her teenage son Philly to be shot in both legs. Majella Philly and his shooters all live within an extraordinary community in Derry Northern Ireland. The "Troubles" officially ended in 1998 but this community is still at war. They do not accept the government or police. All this happens within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. How do you bring your son to be shot? What happens afterwards? How does family life continue? How does a community respond? When do wars really end? For five years Sin√©ad O'Shea has filmed this shocking portrait of a post conflict society.
