A music and dance film without narration about wedding music in Bulgaria. This genre of music which is both traditional and modern is a furious cocktail of Balkan folk combined with elements of jazz and rock 'n' roll driven by rhythms of breathtaking complexity. Although it is called "wedding music" it is played mostly by Gypsy musicians at all festive occasions. Filmed at a music-filled Gypsy wedding in a village in northern Bulgaria "Ziganska musica" features the popular clarinet virtuoso Philip "Fekata" Simeonov with his electric Gypsy band "Trustenik" with vocals by Yordan "Dancho" Panov. It also turns its attention to the participants while they dance eat sing and bestow gifts and to those villagers who watch the proceedings with curiosity. Made by the filmmakers whose feature-length film about the legendary American mouth organist Larry Adler "Larry - My Life and Music" was selected by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as "one of the outstanding documentaries of 1993".
