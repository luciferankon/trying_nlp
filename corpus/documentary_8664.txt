Vincent Van Gogh remains the ultimate example of the tortured artistic genius. His whole life was a struggle against poverty loneliness and mental disorder. In a feverish spell of painting prior to his death Vincent Van Gogh proved himself a great artist. The hundreds of canvases that he painted in the South of France are now recognized as masterpieces of the Post-Impressionist age. His use of thick swirling color was a conscious attempt to express his own tortured state of mind through his work. In his landscapes still-lifes and portraits he succeeded. Though he sold just one painting in his lifetime works such as "Sunflowers" now sell for tens of millions of dollars.
