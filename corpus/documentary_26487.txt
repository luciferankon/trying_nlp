In 1970 Neil Young wrote the song "Southern Man". In 1974 Ronnie Van Zandt of Lyrnrd Skynrd responded with "Sweet Home Alabama". These two songs were staples of a country torn apart by Racism. A lot like today with the rise in white nationalism Ronnie and Neil's tune ring truer than ever. Is it possible to see eye to eye? Neil and Ronnie found a way. When Ronnie died in 1977 Neil was there to carry his casket. Maybe it is?
