Iris lives alone in a spacious apartment by the sea. The green horizon seems to distance it from the city in comfortable isolation. At nightfall the place hosts known and unknown in a frantic party flow. Iris is the main attraction. But on a hungover morning she finds a corpse in the living room. As in the distorted reflection of a crooked mirror Iris feels repeating steps of her childhood friend Tiara a medical student involved in an accident that resulted in death in the past. Tiara plunges into a spiral of self-pity sentimental emptying and violence. The case is well known in town and Iris does not want to become another ghost in this dark repertoire of stories. In All colors of the night reality works as a dimension of imagination memory and madness.
