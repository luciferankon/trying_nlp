The first deployments of Crittercam on land animals were with lions in Kenya as part of a study of predation on domestic cattle. We see the female African lion nuzzling and interacting with her cubs. POV video is from the "Point of View" of the animal on which it is attached as part of the Crittercam research program. They're presented by popular demand from those who want to see more POV footage than appears in other Crittercam videos.
