In 2011: Due to the attendance of Frightfest rising 400% the West End of London has been turned into a walled maximum security prison to contain genre fans and is now under the command of the self appointed Mayor of London. He in turn has captured the P.R. President of Frightfest (Greg Day) who holds the only guest passes left to the event. Miss S. Plissken has been sent on a deadly mission to obtain one of the precious guest passes... and this feisty Snake is gonna need to kick some major butt especially when she comes up against Harold "Brain" Helman in a fight to the death! This short film lovingly recreates and homages a few scene from 'John Carpenter (I)' (qv)'s 1981 classic "_Escape From New York (i981)_".
