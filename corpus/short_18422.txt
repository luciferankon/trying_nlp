There is no reliable documentation that a film bearing this title was ever released despite its inclusion in the error-filled pages of The Universal Silents by Richard E. Braff. IMP's release for 5 April 1915 was _The Story the Clock Told (1914)_ (qv) also starring 'Frances Nelson' (qv); this may be the working title or a re-release title of that same film.
