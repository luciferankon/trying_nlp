I'm Carolyn Parker unfolds as an inspiring portrait of an extraordinary woman. Carolyn Parker was the last to leave her neighborhood when Hurricane Katrina approached New Orleans in the summer of 2005. After the floodwaters subsided she was the first resident to return to her now flood-devastated community with what many thought was the "impossible dream" of bringing her ruined home back to life. A Jonathan Demme film.
