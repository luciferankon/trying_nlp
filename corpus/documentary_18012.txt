The Vocation of St. Wendelin is a film that contrast the rebirth of a once closed Cleveland Church on its 5th anniversary of reopening and an art installation created by sculptor Sandro Bonaiuto. Sandro is a world renown sculptor trained in Italy in the classic Greek and Roman style. He has completed high profile projects in Cleveland as well as the Vatican in Rome for the Pope. The steps involved in the process of completing a bronze statue are shown as well as final placement of the statue while the community celebrates the unveiling.
