After one of the friends suffers a serious accident all four are forced to take an introspective look at their own lives - and experience the various messages found in Outwitting the Devil - and how those messages both positively and negatively affect each one respectively. The film opens fifteen years into the future on a sound stage and with the making of a motion picture. Within moments we discover that the film being produced is the making of the book Outwitting the Devil with an actor playing Napoleon Hill from 1938 in his study. We view this production from behind the scenes. Along with us is a mysterious man also observing the production. So there is essentially a movie within the movie. As the actor (Napoleon Hill) engages the Devil in a cross examination the mysterious man while listening to the exchange between Hill and the Devil and hearing the messages being delivered reminisces to fifteen years earlier when he was one of four friends who through life altering events receive the message of Outwitting the Devil and permanently change their lives because of it.
