Max is a struggling actor looking for his first big break in Hollywood. When he lands the position of personal assistant to actresses and close friends Cheryl Hines and Rachael Harris he is thrilled to officially be on the road to fame. The only catch is that Cheryl and Rachael need major help with absolutely everything. Max casts integrity aside and finds himself doing things no self-respecting man would ever do. After all he only needs one good showbiz connection to get his first official acting role or so he thinks.
