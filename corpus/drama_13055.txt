This off-beat psychological drama by Sohrab Shahid Saless dissects German post-war society with a cutting edge. Herbert (Heinz Lieven) is a solid middle-class engineer who one day quits his job and ensconces himself at home (preferably in the bathroom) refusing to say very much to anyone. His wife (Dorothea Moritz) is all the more upset at his behavior because on Sunday mornings he goes out into the street and yells at the top of his lungs for everyone to "get up." Eventually the hard-working wife who is also earning their support convinces Herbert to go to a clinic for treatment. But is it a clinic he needs? Or is Herbert rebelling against a society that is too ordered too sterile too buried in the monotony of routine?
