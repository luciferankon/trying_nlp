Dan drives girlfriend Lisa from London to his parents' West Country village of Bamford for the Christmas holidays. The family is eccentric and enthusiastic to put it mildly with plain-speaking and fancy jumpers being the order of the day. Furthermore everybody is on at the couple to get married - except for jaundiced Uncle Tony who gets Dan so stoned that his subsequent actions send Lisa back to London on her own. Fortunately the family rallies to ensure that Dan has a Gert Lush Christmas.
