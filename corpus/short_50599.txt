In a dream a man returns to the place where he had lived as a child. Drawn toward the house he grew up in he searches for his dead mother and finds her apparently alive. Overjoyed to see her he sets about putting her overgrown garden to rights only to find he has singularly failed to please her. Saddened he tries to fathom out what is going on in this strange place. His mother meanwhile disappears as mysteriously as she had materialized. Dogged by a particularly attentive crow he finally retreats returning to the long hard road that takes him back to reality.
