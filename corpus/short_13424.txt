The relation between now and then before and after the absence of the non-presence and the awareness of the presence when is gone. A look at the inner psychological confusion of the inability to capture the now and its demonstration by emphasising on the fragile imperfect human connections. The cast includes Matteo Bologna and Barbara Torres Dos Reis.
