Baron Leijoncloo comes back to Sweden after many years in Argentina. On his way to his good friend Victor Sällberg's home he loses his luggage. A con artist Jönsson finds it and uses the baron's title to get invited to the manor of Mr. and Mrs. Blomqvist. By a coincidence the baron also comes to the manor pretending to be Mr. Blomqvist's new private secretary.
