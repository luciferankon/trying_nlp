The international adoption process of children from South Korea emerged as a result of the casualties of the Korean War that lasted from 1950 to 1953. In the chaotic aftermath of the war many children were lost orphaned or abandoned due to severe economic and social problems. Since that time more than 200000 have been adopted by families abroad and found themselves immersed in new cultures and languages. In 1963 eight tiny but courageous babies boarded on the Korean air to join their new parents in the United States. These little flight buddies were the "first wave" of adoptees organized by Holt International who got new parents abroad. 54 years later these brave warriors who are now in their fifties are searching for their long lost "Flight Buddies." Their mission is to reunite and to regain their identities. Flight buddies are on their journey back to South Korea to reconnect with their culture and reconcile with the past.
