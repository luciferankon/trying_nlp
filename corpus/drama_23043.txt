Newspaper reporter Jack Bradley marries Ruth Shelton who was abandoned by another man in order to give her infant son a name. Years later as an editor of a powerful metropolitan newspaper Bradley wages a campaign against "Big Jim" Garvan the corrupt political boss of the town. Ruth's son Howard who bears Bradley's name is in love with Garvan's daughter May. While attempting to uncover some scandal that would destroy Bradley Garvan finds Tom Leighton Howard's real father. Garvan uses Leighton to blackmail Bradley and as the election draws near Howard discovers the truth of his parentage and overcome with hate kills his own father. At the trial Howard is acquitted on the grounds that he was suffering from an inherited instinct of hate and was justified in the murder of his mother's persecutor. Bradley then defeats Garvan and all ends happily as Howard marries May.
