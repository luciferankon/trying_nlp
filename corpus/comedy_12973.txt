Two weeks before Christmas Noel is left home alone in Porthcawl a sleepy seaside town in South Wales and dumped by his long term girlfriend for another guy; a taller and more rugged alternative. Faced with the unknown he turns to primal scream therapy with his self-taught therapist Simon and retreats to the past reminiscing with his old school pal Steve. A chance encounter with Cherie a disillusioned actress who has returned home to reflect on her past and present to begin a more fulfilled life leads Noel to open up and share his passions. Their shared love of music eighties movies and all things Christmas encourages a celebratory spirit and the possibility of a Happy New Year. Will the insecurities of recent break­ups seasonal intoxication and mis­communication conspire to ruin their fun or will they simply have a Wonderful Christmas Time?
