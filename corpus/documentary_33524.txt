This Documentary provides an inside view into the life of up-tempo Poet writer drug-abuser and Jazz DJ Jules Deelder. The film takes us from jazz-festival to jazz-festival. There he plays his impressive and rare collections of records mostly for himself and with some disregard for his audience.

The essence of Jules Deelder a man of many words but one whom is hard to understand/grasp is best captured in the dramatically styled 8mm black an white footage used in the film.
