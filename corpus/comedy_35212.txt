This Flemish comical format the title of which paraphrases the Italian wine-distillate since its first syllable "grap" is Dutch for joke and the notion spirit is used in terms for both alcoholic beverages and wit has no permanent cast but just a pool of actors from which each episode draws without a consistent story for a series of successive short sketches -without any commentary- evoking 'classical' jokes which rarely have more in common then the presence of one archetypal character as butt and/or joker such as the 'Hollander' (Dutchman: typical neighbor people-rivalry).
