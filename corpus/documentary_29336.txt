An artist is searching to establish dialogue in the chaotic system of values and the lack of spirituality in the surrounding environment. He finds his "bridge over the wall" in different parts of the world with people of various denominations. With the same passion he paints pictures decorates churches and composes music. He believes that artistic language is nearer to people than the language of the politicians.
