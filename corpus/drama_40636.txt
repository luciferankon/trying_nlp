Matsuzaka Bistro is a hot diner in Taiwan where people go for great homemade food and the welcoming atmosphere of a loving family that owns it. But it could all be a hoax. The sweet parents ('Pei-An Lo' (qv) and 'Phoebe Huang' (qv)) and their enthusiastic son ('Chih-kung Tou' (qv)) and daughter ('Mariko Ookubo' (qv)) are actually not even related to each other. The strangers met by coincidence when they each needed a new start in life and decided to become a family in order to open the restaurant.
