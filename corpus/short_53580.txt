Carey Wilson narrates this MGM Miniature short in which an average office worker suffers all week-end because his boss who had a bad case of indigestion didn't speak to him when he came to work on Friday and is convinced he is going to get fired. John Jones is a good employee conscientious and hard working. When the boss comes in one morning and fails to respond to his 'good morning' he's worried he's on the way out. He's so worried in fact - about car payments the house mortgage and so on - that he fails to action a rush order. He has a sleepless night and decides he has to resign when he finds the order in his pocket. He writes a letter to his boss and asks his son to mail it for him. Who does he meet at the golf course but his boss who is cheery and greets him warmly. He rushes home to see if the damage can be undone.
