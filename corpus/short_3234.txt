Inspiration: a force or influence that makes someone want to do something or that gives someone an idea about what to do or create or be better Inspiration could come to one in any form at any point in one's life. One could be at one's lowest point completely given up all hope and that's when something some experience the most un-thought-of sources helps spawn and inspire a great idea which could change one's life completely. A work of art a mother feeding her baby or even a dog trying to cross the road. There are no coincidences in life. Everything happens for a reason. The person that wandered in and out of your life was there for some purpose. Sometimes it doesn't make sense the short periods of time people come in our lives or the outcomes from what they say or do. However sometimes if one let's things happen one will definitely see the big picture thereafter. This is a story of one such experience for a man Sadiq Sheikh who is at his lowest point in life because of his situation when he comes across another man Cyrus Irani who is completely opposite to his character for a few moments. Cyrus compares the process of making of his favorite dish Akuri (Spiced Scrambled Eggs made by Zoroastrian Parsis) to the philosophy of life in a very simplistic and matter-of-fact but beautiful way amazing Sadiq at the way Cyrus makes a simple dish look so heroic. This chance meeting changes Sadiq's outlook and approach towards life and inspires hope inside him. Akuri...and a pinch of hope is a quintessential humane and simple narrative of how an optimistic attitude of the mind can lead to positive outcomes and circumstances in one's life.
