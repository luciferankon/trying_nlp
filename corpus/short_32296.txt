Nu Body explores the light vs dark the real vs fairytale versions of female existence. It asks questions: who owns the female body? What is the female experience today? What is womanhood? What is the world teaching our daughters? Why are so many daughters still buried before they get chance to live? The symbolism and colour red is significant within particularly eastern traditions and customs that claim to define the worth of a girl into womanhood. Imagery plays with versions of reality and fantasy exploring the idea that our own realities and truths are informed by our genders. Women have climbed mountains through centuries of oppression. Whilst remembering and giving thanks to the women - both famous figures and our own family members - who have paved the way for the more equal society in which we live today 'Nu Body' glimpses the injustices still facing 'the fairer sex'. 'I may break again and again But every-time I shall rise from that very ground Like dust clinch spec to spec Chanting a whisper "build the broken" I am what you do not see. I am what you do not see.'
