A nerdish computer-type stumbles upon a virtual computer program that puts the viewer right into the experience. His roommate convinces him to use it as a sex-type program and sell folks various sexual "experiences." Meanwhile the nerd aspires to date a girl he's too shy to approach and hopes the virtual encounter program will help him out. The high-tech hijinks at Midvale College give a whole new meaning to the term "physical education" as the apt pupils are instructed in the finer points of pleasure by a computer program that generates "virtual" partners.
