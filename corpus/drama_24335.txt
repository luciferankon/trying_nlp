Chicago filmmaker Jeffrey Maccubbin's newest work looks deeply into how two men strive to find peace with their innermost demons. Simon is a hustler caught in the underbelly of queer culture. Late one night Simon slips on the ice that throws him into the arms of Evan the host of a cable show who suffers from Tourette's Syndrome. After a night of unbridled sex Simon realizes that Evan's ticks have subsided. He believes that he is meant to save Evan from his afflictions leading them to unabashedly dive into a sado-masochistic relationship. Simon basks in a world where sadness and depression have become his new turn on and where his emotional destruction is the only true way to give Evan his soul.
