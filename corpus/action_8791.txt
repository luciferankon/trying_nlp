This CD-I racing simulation allows one-to-four players to compete on ten fictional race tracks located across the United States. Each player begins with a go-kart and works his way up to a Formula 1 race car. Winnings are used to purchase better speed acceleration and tires for each car. Video Speedway features digitized video of stock racing footage as well as specially shot scenes of a car mechanic and a trophy girl.
