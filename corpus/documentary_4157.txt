What goes on behind the scenes at the Pitt Rivers Museum home to some of the most important collections of ethnography and archaeology in the world? What is the work that goes on to preserve catalogue research display and communicate this vast collection and who are the people who make this happen? Filmmakers Udi Mandel and Alan Mandel were faced with the challenge of trying to answer these questions through a documentary when they were invited to make a behind-the-scenes film following the Small Blessings project which sought to animate the Museum's eclectic amulet collections. Seven months and 50 hours of footage later 'Artisans of Memory' is a film about this encounter with the Museum and its staff.
