In order to get rid of a strict P.E. teacher three thirteen-year-old friends make false accusations of sexual harassment but they didn't think through the possible consequences and they get in way over their heads. But fear and their parents' involvement won't allow them to admit the truth and stop the avalanche they've started. Now all of a sudden instead of childish things they're dealing with adult affairs such as consciences and punishment which they're not ready for. As well as with things like consequences which are serious for everyone involved.
