In 1969 a group of students at Miskatonic University in witch-haunted Arkham Massachusetts decided to emulate the West Coast and put on their own sort of "happening" where "music and atmosphere could combine to create an alteration of consciousness" with the clandestine help of a little LSD. Or maybe a lot. Unfortunately the professor they chose to serve as faculty adviser on the project had an agenda of his own; see he was a philosophy professor one who specialized in the "study of Evil" and one who saw the Miskatonic Acid Test as an opportunity for a little experiment. As the music and drugs reached their peak he ascended the stage and began to read incantations from the dread Necronomicon.
