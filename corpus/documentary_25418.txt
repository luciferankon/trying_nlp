One of the best concert halls in the world is to be built in the Hafencity Hamburg Germany. The film shows the immense effort required for the best sound experience: from the suspension of the whole concert hall to the acoustics tests in the huge 1: 10 model and the latest acoustics-related changes to the seating of the chairs. When the NDR team shot the first pictures for a documentary about the construction of the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg in April 2005 they all assumed that the concert hall would be finished in no later than four years. But: It has become one of the longest filmed productions in the history of NDR television. Over a period of eleven and a half years the largest construction site in Hamburg is documented in this film by all its ups and downs.
