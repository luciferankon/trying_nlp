French-Canadian rubberband duckpin bowling TV competition that aired in Quebec Canada on a French-Canadian TV network station called "TVA Quebec." The game in this series was owned by the S.Q.A.Q.:Les Salon de Quilles Associes du Quebec ("The Lounge of the Skittles Associates of Quebec"). The French-Canadians addressed the rubberband duckpin bowling pins as "Petites Quilles" meaning:(Small Skittles) in French. Which the English speaking Canadians called just them plain "Duckpins." But these pins were invented in Baltimore Maryland USA in the 1930's with rubber bands attached to them to make them easy to make strikes when they are hit by the bowling ball. Comparing with the regular duckpins that were invented sometime around 1900 they can never make easy strikes out of them.
