Following the stories of two youth this film addresses the impact of policing and surveillance specifically on young immigrant and black communities in New York City. Youth producers are hoping to use the film to raise awareness among high school students about how they can fight back against Islamophobia and racism in their schools on the streets and in NYC policy.
