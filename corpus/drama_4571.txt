Pathfinder is a unique interactive movie developed in partnership with the US Army Airborne School Fort Benning Georgia. In Pathfinder the viewer becomes SSG Mike Williams. You have to think and react in critical situations - ranging from preparing for a proficiency jump back home to preparing for a unique sling load in a deployed setting. The decisions you make can determine the success or failure of the mission.
