Honest businessman Amar Chowdhury (Rajak) had a happy family with his wife two sons daughters-in-law and a daughter. He reared Sankar (Prasenjit) an orphan boy as his own son. Sankar looked after each and every need of this family. Amar Chowdhury won the post of president of the mill owners' association by defeating strong competitor Rudraprasad Sen (Dulal Lahiri) . Out of grief Rudraprasad Sen burnt the factory of Amar Chowdhury with the help of Vikram (Arun Banerjee) and made every effort to make him penny-less. In that helpless situation Arun Chowdhury's sons insulted and deserted him. They also slandered Sankar. Amar Chowdhury drove Sankar out by showing false anger. Sankar achieved his goal of becoming an actor with the help of Kesto da (Sunil Mukherjee) a production manager. After the completion of 'Chowdhury Villa' Shanti Devi (Anuradha Roy) died out of grief. Sankar became rich and artfully saved 'Chowdhury Villa' from Rudraprasad Sen.
