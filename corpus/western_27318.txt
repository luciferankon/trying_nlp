The best job on this film is the one performed by director/writer/producer Ande Lamb when he persuaded somebody at Columbia to put their logo on this indie production that looks a little like what PRC might have made on a bad day and once past the first five-billed players it is a game of "who dat?" This one finds Calamity Jane learning that her ownership of the "Prairie Queen" saloon bequeathed to her by the late unseen Frank Mullen is going to be disputed by Frank's niece Cecelia Mullen and her lawyer Gordon Hastings brought to town by her rival saloon owner Matt Baker. Calamity and her aide Colorado Charley try to run Gordon out of town but this fails and he and the niece are soon on Calamity's side against Baker.
