Morecambe FM disc jockey Lewis Loud is thrilled to be appearing in his first pantomime 'Dick Whittington' opposite glamorous soap star Tamsinwith whom he starts an affair though his flair for improvisation sets him against the conservative director Francis and ambitious producer Diwho is pushing her reluctant daughter Chantelle. Other cast members are discontented - RADA-trained Johnny feels it is a come-down to be playing the dame whilst pint-sized Greg is disappointed to be the non-speaking cat rather than one of the seven dwarfs that he normally plays. Lewis also has his young son Paul dumped on him when his ex-wife chooses to go abroad with her new man. Crisis occurs when Tamsin pulls out of the show to enter a TV reality contest and asks Lewis to go with her. But Lewis will not disappoint his son or his fellow performers andill-assorted as they may bethey are all professionals and they pull together to ensure the success of the panto.
