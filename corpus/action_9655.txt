This game is a spin-off of the film Ice Age: The Meltdown and seen through the eyes of Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel. Scrat is making his way to finding more and more acorns and assorted nuts as he like all of the megafauna of the Ice Age makes it to safety from the oncoming flood. As he makes it through he must find nuts by solving puzzles helping out other animals in their pursuits and generically risking his life by occasionally fighting some rogue animals which wish to do him harm. As he moves along he usually has a run-in or two with Manny Sid Diego the Possum brothers Ellie Cholly or some other animals which help him out in his pursuits.
