Within the vast arid northeastern region of Mexico the state of Sinaloa received an unexpected gift from nature: that of its eleven legendary rivers. A basic prerequisite for life in pre-Hispanic communities in colonial times -under the rule of Jesuit missionaries- both the rivers themselves and agricultural activity their natural derivation continued to be the foundation of the region's social and economic network. Towards the end of the 19th century however agriculture was still a completely local traditional activity geared towards subsistence. But very soon this would change. Through investments promoted by the Porfirio DÃ­az regime advances in communications and the emergence of new national and foreign entrepreneurs with a modern vision of agricultural potential Sinaloa was able to win the ranking it holds today as a leader in food production.
