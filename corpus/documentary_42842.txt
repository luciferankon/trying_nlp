An intimate portrait of a new-born baby boy Tibor and his two mothers Daja and Jedrt who fight against the social discrimination of their family. They are the only homosexual parents to take an active part in a campaign for same-sex marriage referendum taking place in Slovenia just before Christmas 2015. The challenge of motherhood is hardened by their political opponents who publicly expose them as pedophiles and label their relationship as non-natural.
