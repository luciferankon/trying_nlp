Ik Kudi Punjab Di is the story of a girl who challenges the male dominated society of Punjab and wants to be treated at par with the boys. We all say that there is no difference between a boy and a girl but we all know that truth is something else. Our heroine understands that her struggle is not going to be easy but she is prepared to make any sacrifice for that. For that she has to fight with her lover her parents and relatives. The hero understands her feelings(that what she wants) and wants to help her but for that he has to face his parents. They find a wonderful world of theatre that can help them in achieving their goal. The background of Punjab University campus Chandigarh gives an authentic and realistic feel to the film. Do they win against all odds? Let's hope so... but it's going to be much more difficult and painful journey than they thought.
