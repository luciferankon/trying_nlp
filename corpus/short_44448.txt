An enthusiastic grandfather sits with children in a Parisian park talking about pigeons. First. their physical appearance - eye wings and tail and color - and their varieties. Then he encourages the children to imitate their walk. He points out courtship and mating rituals then provides an illustrated discussion of how they eat. This section is punctuated by a flock of pigeons fighting over a small hard ball each wants to eat; the narrator's describes it as if it were a soccer match. He concludes with a discussion of pigeons taking off landing and flying; he uses slow motion and stop-time photography to show his audience.
