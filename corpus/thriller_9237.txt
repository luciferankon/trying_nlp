Pierre Foret is funny and that is his tragedy. That is also his job he warms up the audience on a TV set. Pierre Foret is funny but he would rather be good-looking. Or an actor. Or a singer. A matter of credibility. Pierre Foret cannot take it any more. He has not slept in six nights. He has kidnapped Clovis Costa the singer the Idol and sequesters him in the apartment he grew up in. No way out.
