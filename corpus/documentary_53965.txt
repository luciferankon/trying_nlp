In late 2006 Ryan Gerstenbuhler a university student living with spastic cerebral palsy wrote a proposal for a visual arts endeavor with himself as the undraped subject. The project was envisioned as a respectable but provocative visual presentation offering the public an intimate view of a person living with a physical disability. Stemming from a series of life-drawing sessions the project was realized by a group of artists working in paint illustration collage and sculpture. This film is a document of the discussion and work in the last months leading up to the exhibition opening.
