This experimental poetic video is about a tiredness - dialog of Peter Handke. The philosopher Byung-Chul Han has recourse to Peter Handke's Essay about Tiredness and established the term "fatigue society".

In an essayistic collage based on Handkes "essay about tiredness" Isabella Gresser describe the tiredness as an experience of an in- between time. Through this multilayered experimental video the viewers wander over a japanese landscape with the utopia of Handke.
