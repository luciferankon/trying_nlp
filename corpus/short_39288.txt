A former cold-blooded killer's days are numbered by terminal cancer. With nothing left to live for he comes out of retirement and whittles what time there is on "assignments." His newest targets seem to be strangely normal people however he was never one to question. But as he stakes them out he hears a secret he knows he should not have. Shot entirely in Bethlehem PA director Sean Boyd captures the inner struggle of a man wandering aimlessly through an unjust world. Pill Problem offers a dark glimpse into what happens when self-survival is put aside for the greater good.
