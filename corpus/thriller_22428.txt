The tragic real life story of a serial killer who stalked his victims in the early 1970's in small town America. A weaving trail of twists and turns that left people unsettled for two generations until investigative persistence aided by modern technology brings justice for a young mother and her family some 28 years later. The film An Ordinary Killer reflects the ultimate success story in the intriguing world of forensic investigation. This amazing movie captures the early beginnings of two important investigative techniques that are routinely used in today's criminal investigations those being the scientific process of DNA technology and the behavioral approach of criminal psychological profiling. At the time of the murder of a young woman in 1973 in a Michigan community DNA technology and psychological profiling were unheard of by most criminal investigators. At that time I was serving as a criminologist in the FBI's newly organized Behavioral Science Unit and attempting to convince the law enforcement community that criminal profiling could be useful in a murder investigation and was not akin to voodoo. It seems a detective in Michigan working a murder investigation of a young woman got my message and was inspired and motivated. Above all An Ordinary Killer captures the basic qualities of investigative tenacity that separate those cases that go unsolved to the success story depicted in this compelling drama that spanned several decades. Tony Hornus has produced an important incentive to the law enforcement field to never give up on a crime of violence and to try new forensic techniques. He has also produced an important educational message to the general public concerning the tedious work that goes on in a murder investigation. But most importantly Tony Hornus has issued a warning to the dark side of society that being "If you commit a crime of violence you will be caught no matter how long it takes to catch you."
