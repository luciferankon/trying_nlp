DVD movie version of Philip Westin's opera "Marie's Orchard." The latest American literary masterpiece to receive an operatic makeover is Willa Cather's 1913 novel "O Pioneers!" The opera was staged for live audiences at the Los Angeles based Madrid Theater and then a more cinematic presentation was shot for DVD/Video as a feature film. Composed by Philip Westin with Libretto/story by Dylan F. Thomas the opera condenses and re-focuses Cather's prairie epic concentrating primarily on the character of Marie Tovesky a free-spirited homesteader who becomes involved in a romantic triangle.
