The story is about a woman condemned by 'Justice has run its course' to six years of jail. This woman is mother of an almost two years old daughter. She has to decide what to do with her if to put her in somebody hands or to take her into prison. The film doesn't show any jail it's all ruled in the 'line spacing' that exists between a state of freedom and a state of restriction. In this pneumatic bubble the separation's drama is celebrated. The counterpoint of this event it's a girl pushed by her parents to have psychotherapy's meetings because she's too slim and extravagant. We discover that she's a foster daughter. Two stories intertwined beyond times and spaces given by the reason.
