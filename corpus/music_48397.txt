ASTOR PIAZZOLLA - LIVE AT THE MONTREAL JAZZ FESTIVAL serves as a stunning testament to the virtuosity of Piazzolla and his Quinteto. This live DVD captures the essence of a band and band leader in top form. The audience holds their breath as the band emanates passionate music played with nuance and precision. The music jumps and soars staggers and lurches and the audience responds with thunderous applause after each musical excursion. From the glorious "Resurreccion Del Angel" to the affectionate "Adios Nonino" (a tribute to his late father). This performance recorded on July 4th 1984 and re-mastered for DVD and CD in 2007 showcases some of the most poignant examples of Astor Piazzolla's genius.
