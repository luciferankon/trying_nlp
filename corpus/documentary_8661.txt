In 1768 Captain James Cook and the crew of Endeavour set out from England to Tahiti and Australia. The documentary follows the exact replica of Endeavour and its 21st-century voluntary crew on a six-week journey from the east coast of Australia to Jakarta Indonesia. The 55 men and women onboard - among them the director producer & cameraman Chris Terrill - come from several different countries and nationalities. The crew traces Cook's footsteps from one historical landmark to another. Amids the modern-day disputes between the crew members we see re-enacted scenes of the different events on Cook's perilous journey.
