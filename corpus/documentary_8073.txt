The film discusses the history of cybernetics: from first huge and awkward machines which scientists were trying to design and make them think see and converse to mankind's everlasting journey of learning and longing to create a being in its image and likeness to breath a living soul into it. A parallel story-line talks about the computing power of these machines that were able to detect Leonardo da Vinci's figure among the characters of his own paintings.
