Sixteen guys showed up in the historic hamlet of Hersey and had the time of their lives. Twenty years later 100 players comprised the field for the 20th Penn Masters. Through rain sleet high winds glaring sun fueled by booze competition friendship and a love of the game they keep the traditional alive and well.
