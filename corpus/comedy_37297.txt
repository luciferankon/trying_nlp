Three young Georgians have to clean a castle in Berlin where a German armament manufacturer's collection of contemporary art is being set-up for an exhibition. Of course the proletariat isn't welcome at the opening party and the three protagonists are banished to a small servants' room in the attic. Downstairs however a splendid buffet attracts them - so why not just ignore the unfair prohibition and cross the demarcation line of class society? Didn't the French Revolution start for a piece of cake anyway? Telling each other unlikely stories ranging from an adventure of Saint Francis to a spiritualistic s√©ance in the Soviet Union the three protagonists try to find an answer to this question: Can class relations be overcome when all bequeathed stories say they can't? Besides that they have to struggle with obstinate clouds neo-liberal working conditions apocalyptic petty bourgeois and the agents of a confusing late capitalist conspiracy which they'll all defeat with a laziness one must call messianic. A proletarian winter's tale so to speak. A formalist comedy which follows three young Georgians cleaning a German art collector's castle crashing a high-society party and fantasizing unlikely historical allegories ranging from an adventure of Saint Francis to a spiritualistic seance in the Soviet Union - a fairy tale about class relations told by a black hole.
