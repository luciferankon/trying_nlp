Tired of hearing passé and clichéd stereotypical remarks about the bi/multiracial community -- and discovering the lack of media attention on said individuals -- Billimarie set out to tell a unique story based on her views of "biraciality." An atypical production "Sugar Water" is loosely based on the non-fictional events surrounding Billimarie's everyday life. Told in the form of a diary this film seeks to question the supposed norm of what it means to be biracial in the United States. Balancing humorous commentary with serious issues Billimarie spins a seemingly chaotic tale which all audiences can relate to.
