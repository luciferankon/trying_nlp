The history of farming for blacks in the South has been a long and painful struggle beginning with slavery and extending to the Jim Crow laws of the 1890's that forced many blacks off of their land. In more recent history racist policies by government agencies have driven thousands more black farmers out of agriculture. The Bugg Farm is a tribute to the heritage of strong black farmers who have managed to survive and keep the land in the family for future generations. The farm which originally comprised over one thousand acres was owned by TJ Bugg a former slave who was given the land by the owner of the plantation on which he had toiled. Following in the footsteps of his ancestors Addis Bugg the great great great grandson of TJ Bugg has recently returned to the family farm in Georgia to carry on the farm's legacy and become the 6th generation to farm the land.
