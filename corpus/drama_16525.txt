There is big business at the Treuhand-Anstalt the association to deal with all the eastGerman business after german reunification. There are good players who try to take their job seriously and bad players who try to enrich themselves by making insider deals. When Nina Lensky is given her first chance to evaluate a plant in Thuringia she is framed by local management and believes it to be a well managed and profitable plant. Noone at the Treuhand-Anstalt trusts her evaluation. In fact her colleague Harry Schlenz starts an intrigue and tries to dump the plant for one German mark making an insider deal. Nina is really upset and starts an offensive by identifying with the people in Thuringia.
