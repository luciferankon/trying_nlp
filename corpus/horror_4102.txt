A questionable group of paranormal investigators with their own web series receive the offer of a lifetime: stay one night in a potentially haunted house for a large sum of money. What could possibly go wrong? It seems like easy money to Anton team leader of the group and privately an unbeliever in the supernatural. Mick Roach and Terrance are all investigators that take the entire situation far too lightly at first before everything they believe changes. On that fateful night they learn that it's all fun and games until things get real.
