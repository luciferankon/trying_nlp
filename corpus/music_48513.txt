Rock 'n' roll's favourite bogeyman is back. Known for his ability to merge exhilarating hard rock with darkly theatrical stage shows Alice Cooper reaches new heights in this July 2005 performance at the Montreux Festival. While the visual spectacle delights the eye Cooper's raw sound shocks the ear. This live concert is full of rock anthems plucked from his long career including renditions of "No More Mr. Nice Guy" "I'm Eighteen" "School's Out" and many others.
