Bruno went out with her four days ago and since then no response from her. Today he texted her using whats app two hours and twenty-seven Minutes ago and that does not receive response. He arrives to his neighborhood after a Long day and while shopping in the Chinese supermarket he despairs. He navigates the dark stream of his own thoughts while interacting randomly with some oriental characters. And it does not manage to silence that voice that is sinking more and more in neurotic speculations about the meaning of that double lines of whats app and the lack of answers.
