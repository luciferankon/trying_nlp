U.S. Marshal Gene Autry and his deputy Scat Russell cross into Canda while pursuing bank robbers Pierre LaBlond and Raoul Duval. They meet wounded Canadian Mounted Policeman Terry Dillon whose partner has been killed by the bandits and take him to a cabin where they meet Duval's niece Marie. Jack Duvan Marie's brother hates all lawmen and regards LaBlond as his hero. The elder Duval and Bastiste are captured by the Mounties in a raid which uncovers stolen U.S. gold bullion. LaBlond frees the bandits and takes Marie hostage and forces her to flee with him.
