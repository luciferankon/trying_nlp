Lloyd Kaufman - underground film legend and co-founder of Troma Entertainment Inc.- has been making independent low budget classics like The Toxic Avenger The Class of Nuke 'em High and Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead for over 40 year. Critics pan him fans worship him and through it all Kaufman has continued his DIY ideals preaching to anyone and everyone that they too can make their own damn movie. Movies of the Future with Lloyd Kaufman follows a cinematic cult figure as he continues to create and inspire generations of low-budget filmmakers while completely failing to be taken seriously by an industry that wants nothing to do with him.
