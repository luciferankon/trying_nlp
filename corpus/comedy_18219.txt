She spends the summer in California with her Bohemian aunt uncle and their eccentric artist friends and gets a different perspective on life. Through a series of letters home Sarah establishes the long-missing emotional connection with her parents. A movie filled with original music dancing and surreal dream sequences. The Orange County Register said in a review of the film: "Although rated G Sister Sarah's Sky delivers an artful and intelligent comedic look at everything from communism and capitalism to meditation and the music industry. The film also takes a surprisingly deep look at the forces that can divide and reunite families."
