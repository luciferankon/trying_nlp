When a mother dies of heart failure in a doctor's office the physician--feeling somewhat guilty because he couldn't save her--takes an interest in the woman's young daughter and makes her his ward but his fiancé doesn't particularly like it. After he returns from a three-year engagement in Europe the doctor discovers that his ward is now a beautiful full-grown woman and finds himself falling for her--even though she's engaged to his fiancé's brother.
