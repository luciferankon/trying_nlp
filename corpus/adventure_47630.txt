Protagonist Herman Wundeba is forced to leave his native land due to dwindling resources and relentless bandits. He and three of his henchmen quickly turn on one another as they vie for fertile land in a new world called Catan. Herman makes good use of his charm and sheep supply to reach ultimate glory of the throne only to witness his kingdom fall once again to a destructive storm leading to an ice age. It is up to him to rebuild in a desolate land of scavengers and savages as he promises his followers to turn a humble settlement of brick and mortar to a city of marble and cobblestone.
