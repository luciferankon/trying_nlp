Almost 20 years after the Good Friday agreement that ended a 30-year civil war between the Protestant Loyalists and Catholic Republicans in Northern Ireland this film looks back at the conflict's origins and examines the strength of current peace. Partly shot during centenary celebrations of the Easter uprising that marked the beginning of the end of British dominance.
