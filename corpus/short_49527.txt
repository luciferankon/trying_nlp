DAWNS EARLY LIGHT" is the story of a bigoted Southern sheriff on the eve of a civil rights march in his town circa: 1967. As Clayton lays awake in bed listening to the sound of the approaching cars carrying the "damn northerners" into his town he recalls the days events that have brought on the imminent morning clash. He is a man who's entire sense of order and right is coming into question and the weight of that revelation culminates in a flood of memories from a traumatic childhood. The anatomy of a racist.
