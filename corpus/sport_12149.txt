ATSN.tv's Trigger Sports LIVE! presents the RWVA - Appleseed Project filmed in Piru CA at the Wes Thompson Rifle Range. The Revolutionary War Veterans Association (RWVA) - Appleseed Project teaches citizens how to become Riflemen. The intense weekend training includes shooting targets in 3 positions timed shooting rifle handling with slings and accuracy. Participants earn their Rifleman Patch when they meet the time and accuracy test. The best part of the Appleseed Project is the dedication and knowledge of the volunteers. Their commitment to the Constitution history and our founding fathers is remarkable. The passing of our heritage along to future riflemen is commendable. Learn to shoot and learn our American Heritage.
