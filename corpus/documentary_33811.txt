Not only exposing the rational arguments but also the intuition the human emotion and the new perspective that this gives to our own planet. Interviews with five people who deal with this question from different angles sharing their story on the mysterious topic. Mike Garrett an astronomical whistle-blower and former director of ASTRON Lucas Ellerbroek an astronomer Lange Frans rapper and presenter Heino Falcke professor and pastor and Coen Vermeeren former TU Delft lecturer.
