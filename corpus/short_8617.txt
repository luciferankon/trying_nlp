Remembering is a movie that takes you into the life that chasers lived up until getting the news of what happened to beloved chasers Tim and Paul Samaras along with Carl Young collectively known as Team Twistex. This news devastated the chaser community in a very powerful way. Since that time all storm chasers have to share are photos and memories of their experience with the team. This movie aims to tell those stories. It blends fiction and non fiction as well. Those who have read the script have noted the sense of camaraderie within the story. We want the audience to feel a deep connection to our characters and we believe the story will allow that to happen. We keep getting asked "is this movie about storm chasing?" No this is about the CHASER. There's plenty of tornado movies out there and we're not trying to be another one. So sit back grab some popcorn and follow us along for the ride.
