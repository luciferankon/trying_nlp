Richard works as a respected surgeon in a hospital but unbeknownst to all he has never finished medical school and is without any qualifications. His skills in the surgical department he acquired as a POW in a Russian camp where he used to work as a paramedic. His job in the hospital he got through the help of a grateful patient whose life he saved by performing a difficult operation but under the condition that he must finish his studies and officially qualify. So Richard lives a bizarre double life: as the successful surgeon he works in the hospital and has a romance with the daughter of wealthy parents and at the same time he is a student at the university dating one of his fellow students. When the pressure of all this gets too much for him he makes a brave decision.
