In a small African country a civil war has resulted in the end of Apartheid and former slaves are given possession of their masters' property. They are also authorized to hold trials of the former oppressors bringing charges judging them and meting out punishment. One landowner refuses to leave and his former maid and nine other women who were his slaves hold a trial torturing him and sentencing him to death by "stomping" which they carry out wearing the high heel shoes once owned by his wife (who fled while the getting was good).
