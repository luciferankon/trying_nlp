Blackout is a film about time specifically the loss of time as experienced by a recently sober 23 year-old woman. The narrator discusses her history of experiencing blackouts through drinking; covering a five year time period that culminated in a 72 hour three-day time-loss her last bender. Visually the work stutters through black moments punctuated by originally recorded heavily-edited abstract and representational images. The combination of materials creates a visual upheaval that echoes the content of the narrative.
