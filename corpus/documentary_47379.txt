Al-Hoceima a city located in the Central Riff in northern Morocco is where for the last three generations migration to Europe has become the sole prospect for the future. As a consequence traditional culture in the Riff is dissapearing. In it's place there is no alternatives no new plans and therefore inmigration remains as the only solution. This is the vicious circle in which Rif's society is caught. A homemaker a taxi driver a social worker an entrepreneur an artist a feminist militant and some other characters will show us a reality near geographically but unknown to most European citizens. City of wait wants to confront the partial views that distract us from the very fact that behind each immigrant there is always the life of a migrant person.
