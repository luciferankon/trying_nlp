Brooklyn 1944. Despite being the same age having grown up within blocks of each other and both being Jewish late teens Danny Saunders and Reuven Malter don't really know each other - knowing each other only by name and by sight - as Orthodox Danny stays largely within his own Hasidic community which is just fine in Reuven's mind. An incident between the two which on the surface threatens to tear them even further apart instead blossoms into a friendship between the two. They begin to learn more and more about the other and their lives which for Danny includes becoming a rabbi solely as it is a several generations old family calling. In Reb Saunders' mind he who rules his family by strict Hasidic traditions Danny becoming the next rabbi in the family is not even a question despite Danny deep in his heart wanting other secular pursuits which he has not told his father. Conversely Reuven has modern sensibilities being raised in a two-person household by his widowed academic father Professor David Malter. Ultimately the views of each father may tear Danny and Reuven's friendship apart regardless of whether each son believes wholeheartedly in what his father espouses. Professor Malter is a confirmed Zionist who believes in a secular Jewish state in Palestine while Reb Saunders believes such thinking against Judaism with only the Messiah being able to lead his people into such. As they grow into adulthood Danny and Reuven becoming his own man may further alter their relationship.
