This MGM Oddity shows a couple driving through Mexico. Their first stop is a small village in which all the residents are Russian. They speak only Russian and follow their native customs as much as they are able. At their campsite the travelers witness a fight between two turtles. Finally they stop at a ranch where they see a fight between a German shepherd and a rattlesnake.
