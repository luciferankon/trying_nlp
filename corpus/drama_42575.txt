Visiting American journalist Johnson finds more in Guatemala than he's bargained for. His reporter contact is missing and nobody's looking for him; his first assignment is to meet with priest Pupo so fevered with the advent of Satan that he clobbers an altar boy he fears is possessed; but there's also love in the form of nurse Arloa Reston but who is she meeting in the jungle? Cosmic discussions of good and evil with Pupo and a nihilistic colleague turn into a battle for survival with the still-lurking forces of repression. "Invisible Evidence" is a cinematic journey of an American journalist Marcel in Guatemala where his search for a missing colleague Jorge turns into an unexpected quest for personal growth and eventual reconciliation with the truth of humanity. Like Odysseus's journey home Marcel meets various archetypal characters in his quest - Monsignor Garcia a priest deluded by the pervasive power of religion; Shoehine Boy an innocent street kid who saves Marcel after he is attacked by a group of gangsters; Pablo the cynical co-worker who sees the world as selfish pursuits and temporary desires; Veronica sister of Jorge who shows Marcel love hope and despair in a chaotic world of violence and hatred; and Old Man the wise father who paints a picture of the true meaning of life for Marcel - an awareness of the present in the context of eternity.
