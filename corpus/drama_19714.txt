Firstly there's Youssef who has his identity stolen and who decides to act even if means losing his way. Then there's the young Syrine who will take her first steps in the adult world. And Slim who is perhaps not as paranoid as he appears. Finally there's this house that Youssef and his wife trie to rent. In the hot tunisian summer they couldn't find any renter even if in a spot of its garden you can feel a cool breeze... What will happen to Youssef who will uses this house trying to get rid of his 'double'.
