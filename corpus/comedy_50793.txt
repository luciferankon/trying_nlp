The series follows babes a trio of plump siblings who had other things on their mind besides their weight: like work relationships popularity and starting a family. The ladies also shared a small one-bedroom apartment in New York City which added to the comic friction. The Gilbert sisters include Darlene (Susan Peretz) the eldest who was a dog groomer and recently divorced (her husband had an affair with their weight-loss counselor); Charlene (Wendie Jo Sperber) the middle sister who was a makeup artist for a commercial photographer and was the most active one out of the three; and Marlene (Lesley Boone) the youngest sister a former toll collector (and later an actress in a pantyhose commercial and a soap opera) who was seen as a dreamer with a naive yet trusting personality. Also in the cast was Charlene's boyfriend Ronnie Underwood (Rick Overton) a restaurant owner. He disappeared at mid-season as a result putting all three sisters on the dating market. At that time the girls' landlady Florence Newman (Nedra Volz) became a regular. Three very different sisters share a small apartment in fast paced Manhattan where middle sibling Charlene is upbeat with Ronnie as a boyfriend. Dog groomer Darlene is more cynical while the youngest Marlene is too innocent for the big city.
