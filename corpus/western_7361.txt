When his family is killed by Indians a bitter cowboy turns into a ruthless hired gunman. Unbeknownst to him his son had survived the attack and is now a lawman. The son not knowing that the killer is his father is assigned to bring him to justice. When their wagon is attacked by Indians Collins is saved by an outlaw gang but his wife is killed. He thinks his young son Bill was also killed but Joe Carson finds him and raises him. Collins now the leader of the gang appears just as Bill turns 21 and kills Carson. Bill joins the posse only to be captured by the gang. Collins sends him out to be killed by one of his men but then examining his effects he finds a locket and opening it sees the pictures of his wife and young son. While heading west seeking a new home the Collins family is attacked by Indians. While the frightened Tom Collins (Roger Williams) rides for help his wife Mary (Ruth Findlay) hides their small son Billy (Billy Steven) in a trunk before she is killed. Jim Carson (Earl Dwire) comes upon the scene and takes the boy and adopts him as his own. Collins returns with help and unable to find his family he is befriended by Teague (Ted Adams) and his band of outlaws. 17 years pass and Bill "Carson" is in love with Jean Streeter (Betty Mack) the sheriff's daughter. Sheriff Streeter (Edward Cassidy) wants Bill to become his deputy as the outlaws now led by Collins are becoming more savage and daring by the day. Bill is undecided until one evening during a birthday party given him by Dad Carson the Collins gang enters the house and a henchman kills the only father he ever knew. Pursuing the gang Bill is captured and when searching him Collins finds a locket which he recognizes as one his lost-son had carried.
