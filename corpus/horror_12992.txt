Based on the ancient Scottish ballad "Tam Lin" (one of it's many titles) the plot concerns an aging beautiful woman who uses her wealth (and occasionally witchcraft) to control a decadent pack of attractive young people she surrounds herself with. But when her latest young stud falls for the local vicar's daughter she vows revenge.
