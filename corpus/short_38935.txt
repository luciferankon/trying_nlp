This documentary tells the little known story of how in 1984 a group of young journalists battled institutional prejudice to forever change the newspaper industry becoming the first Latinos to win the Pulitzer Prize journalism's most prestigious award. The year was 1984. A group of Chicano reporters at the LA Times pushed to provide a new perspective on California's Latino population - something more than the poverty gangs and crime that the newspaper usually covered. Their reporting won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service that year. This groundbreaking series offered an in-depth examination of southern California's growing Latino community and was one of the first to accurately represent it. Prior to this prize winning series a distorted view of Latinos had been perpetuated in the media a view which is still perpetuated today. These journalists set out to change that while becoming an important voice in telling the story of the underrepresented Latino community in California.
