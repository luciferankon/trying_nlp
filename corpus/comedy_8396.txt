Wanting more free time for himself Lawrence the owner of a full body massage parlor hires a new manager for the store. The person he hires for the job is Conrad a seemingly nice but feckless man. Conrad's main responsibility as manager is to ensure that the three masseuses working there are not doing full service jobs i.e. having sex with the clients otherwise the police could shut the store down. Lawrence is sure the three are performing full service jobs so that they can make more money. Those three are cynical and acerbic tongued Betty who has a longer term financial plan for her life beyond her current work nipple fetishist Lea who is hiding her profession from her boyfriend Henry and Asian Cindy a naive woman who is working in Canada illegally. Cindy is hoping to find a Canadian husband - even one in a marriage of convenience - so that she can stay in Canada and make a decent living to support her family back home. Conrad's relationship with the three women especially Betty and Lea does not start off well and their power struggle has its ebbs and flows as the four really begin to get to know each other better and understand the others' motivations in life.
