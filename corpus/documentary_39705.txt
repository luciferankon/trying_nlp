Have you ever been in a sticky situation that at first seems near impossible to escape without major implications only to miraculously escape with little more than a bruised ego or a small fine of some sort or a simple apology (as painful as it may be) to rectify the situation? In these instances you pause for a moment and you wonder to yourself "How in the hell did I get out of that?" Then if only for a second you thought "The energy in the Universe is protecting me!" You know you've been in this situation before perhaps even more than once. What if you were able to see or learn first hand how traditional meditation and energy balance taught from Monks of ancient monasteries can protect you day in and day out?
