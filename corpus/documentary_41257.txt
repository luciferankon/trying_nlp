In 1975 an executive from Labatt's Brewery a lawyer and a local politician set out to bring Major League Baseball to the City of Toronto. Their journey led them to purchase the San Francisco Giants and face-off against a liberal first-time mayor who desperately wanted to save a team no one wanted. Through a series of fortunate and unfortunate circumstances including a broken promise to Expos owner Charles Bronfman this group managed to bring an American League franchise to the city but this was completely unexpected.
