In this documentary co-author of Redefining Health Care and Harvard strategy professor Michael E. Porter PhD shares the culmination of more than 20 years of work documenting what happens when organizations use the value-based care model. He makes the case that the healthcare industry should concentrate on quality as measured by patients even suggesting that organizations who cannot deliver high-quality care in certain areas should redirect their resources toward care delivery where they can be the best in the world. Additionally Martini-Klinik (a world leader in volume and quality of prostatectomies) shares how a surgeon in the group improved care quality using these patient-reported outcomes. Sahlgrenska University Hospital (Gothenburg Sweden) and Boston Children's Hospital add to the success stories that the value-based model is bringing to healthcare. The documentary also includes insightful commentary from Stefan Larsson MDPhD Senior Partner and Managing Director at The Boston Consulting Group and Christina Akerman CEO of the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement.
