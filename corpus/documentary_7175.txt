At a moment in time when humanity is obsessed with food - photographing every dish worshipping cooks and flaunting trophy meals on social media this documentary goes under the surface and offers an in-depth honest and relevant view into the world and every day of Michelin chefs and restaurants. Telling tales from a grand menu of culinary temples as well as digging into the greatness and flaws of Guide Michelin in this golden age of gastronomy. Because we share a great love for the industry that also includes a realistic understanding of things behind the picturesque scenes of the - perhaps - greatest most creative and dynamic industry in the world.
