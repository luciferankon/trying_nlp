Joey T's personal journey which has now become a television series began with a single email he received from the mother of a very sick child who needed a boost. That was all it took for Joey T to take charge and pull the neighbors out of their houses and to learn about those that live down the street and needed their help. "We get people off the back deck and back onto the front porch." says Joey T show host.
