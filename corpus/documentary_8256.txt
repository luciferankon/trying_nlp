In May 2006 American avant-garde playwright director and designer Richard Foreman and his creative collaborator Sophie Haviland visited Loughborough University for their film and theatre workshop The Bridge Project. Over a period of two weeks they worked with students and professional performers to create a resource bank of visual images on film for use in Richard's theatre work and Sophie's art installations. The Bridge project is an ongoing international collaboration initiated by Ontological Hysteric Theater Company in 2004 and involving the creation and sharing of work in many different countries around the world. This video documents the UK phase of the project and includes unique insights into Foreman's directorial process as well as interviews with Foreman and Haviland and performers involved in the filming.
