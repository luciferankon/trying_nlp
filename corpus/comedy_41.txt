If you want to preserve a feeling of relative safety and harmony in life you better avoid thinking too much about certain matters. Like what sausages consist of how laws are made. And what really goes on in hospitals. The Archive follows the daily chores of six individuals who work in the deep catacombs of a hospital more specifically in the hospital archive where the case records are kept. Archive Director Dagny loves her colleagues with all her heart. But is love and care enough when the hospital administration sends their most insensitive computer engineer to take on the (long overdue) task of digitizing every file from A to Z? How can they preserve status quo when facing the evil nerd from hell? Dagny claims they have nothing to fear but fear itself. After all engineers have their own jobs she reasons they have no interest in taking theirs. Her strategy: don't rock the boat and everything will eventually return to normal.
