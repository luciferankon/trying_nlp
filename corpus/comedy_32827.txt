Based on the real life biggest PONZI scheme perpetrated on U.S. soil in modern times before the Madoff's of the world took financial rip-offs to new heights. The story of two scammers that had no Wharton MBA nor a hedge fund AKA license to steal... they in fact had not even gone to college. They were essentially a couple of Southern idiots and in the 90's high interest returns didn't raise eyebrows they instead raised a lot of money $300M to be exact. It's an outrageous and hysterical tale of international proportions.
