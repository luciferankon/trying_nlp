Our documentary's subject centres on Catherine an anthropology student in her exploration of a plant extract known as ibogaine; a compound that many claim to be the world's most powerful psychedelic. It will focus on her personal journey through the experience of taking ibogaine; from her preparation the session itself and her experiences days weeks and months after. It follows her as she researches the topic in terms of its therapeutic benefits and wider social and cultural context. Here in addition to its psychedelic qualities she will look at its use in African spiritual ceremonies such as those of the Bwiti and the claims surrounding its use as a 'miracle' overnight cure for opiate addiction and a variety of other physical and mental health issues.
