A king appears materializes in minute form deals the cards of his suit and disappears. The magician opens out the pack until the cards stand in line when a king and queen rise step from their cards give ocular and graceful demonstration of their affection and retire once more into private card life. An ace next arises the center filled by a jocund face whose features work in a most ludicrous manner after which it divides and sub-divides into four aces each with its own animated center face a comic picture. These arrange themselves in a row and indulge in facial contortions of a most humorous character and the series concludes with the mysterious formation of the whole pack face outwards onto a sheet with a smiling animated Joker in the center.
