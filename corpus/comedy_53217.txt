John a Venezuelan filmmaker is to direct a feature film to be shot in the Amazonian jungle. The leading lady 'melts'; WW the American producer moves the set to to Caracas; Marvin the leading man is homosexual and Wanda is a vampire. To add to this the Cooks speak Latin and Eva the leading lady was a topless dancer. Thieves attack Marvin who reacts as a karate expert. A snake bites a Nazi skinhead. A tenor suffocates while singing a High C. The policeman loves magic. The 'shadow' of a movie spectator interplays with the actors. A false parrot drinks beer; a carnivorous plant eats the parrot and burps. WW is part of a band of international delinquents that sell arms under the cover of film making. The dead 'celebrate' dancing Bollywood style.
