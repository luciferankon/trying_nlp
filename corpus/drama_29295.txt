Shikoku Katya (age 6) is a girl with a rich imagination -- so much so that she sees everything around her as a cartoon character. Shikoku's dream is 'filling the whole town with my characters!' The years pass and before she realizes it Shikoku is already twenty-nine and a self-described character artist.
