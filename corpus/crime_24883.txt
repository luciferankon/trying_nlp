Lucie Champagne is given the role of the victim Marie-Claire in a film of a true unsolved murder. By coincidence Lucie's neighbour Francois was Marie-Claire's boyfriend. He is a suspect in the continuing investigation and is unsure of his own innocence although he has an alibi from his previous girlfriend Claude. Francois' polygraph (lie detector) test proves inconclusive and while he awaits his second test Lucie's film is completed with its own ideas on who killed Marie-Claire.
