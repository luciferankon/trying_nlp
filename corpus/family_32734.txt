Daniel Cook's new series I Dare You is set to encourage kids to exercise while having fun. Drawing on Daniel's established friendship with pre-schoolers Daniel playfully dares the audience to join him on three fun physical movements. Each action builds on the previous one leading to a finale in which all three dares are combined into a final fitness medley.
