Up to 10000 people were living there at one point. The Jungle at Calais was the biggest refugee settlement in Western Europe. Forgotten or neglected by those responsible for protecting the lives and human rights of refugees the burning question at The Jungle was always: "Where is everyone?" This documentary film records the facts and shows the truth bringing us face to face with contemporary political surrealism through the sceptical reflections of refugees and volunteers and the amazing force of civil mobilisation. Maybe it's time we listen to those voices reminding us that Humanity is in crisis!
