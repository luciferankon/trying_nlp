Every town has a story about its beautiful promenades and cascading vineyards which extend past the freeway up to the horizon; a symbol of its achievements in excellence. A story free of the people who today only reside in the many cardboard boxes filled with VHS tapes stored away in forgotten attics. Play back one of these tapes today and you'll find another story beginning and ending with Play and Stop of seven adolescents for whom the future they envision seems painfully out of reach. Two years after their high school graduation a group of friends caught in the heat of the summer look towards endless house parties careers cheap restaurants and latent artistic interests to fill up their new-found empty hours.
