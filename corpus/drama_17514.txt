A child living as prey to an opium-addicted father drowning in a gene-pool of lowest expectations feels shackled for life to the tobacco farms and cotton mill poverty of 1920s western North Carolina.

Emerging from their adolescent love the narrative rises far out beyond that opening milieu of violence ignorance and language-literal religious fundamentalism.
