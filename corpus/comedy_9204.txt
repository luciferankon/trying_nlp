After 15 years the zombies are very docile and barely a threat really more of a nuisance. The "heroes" Hobbes and Phil are pretty much just into surviving on chips and beer and all about fun. Kato (Hobbes' younger brother) has an outlook to make the world a better place and gets annoyed by the lack of care shown by his brother and Phil. Meanwhile a group of mercenaries have kidnapped a young lady Kamber who may hold the key to restoring a world gone by. It is up to Hobbes and Phil to save the girl...and save the world
