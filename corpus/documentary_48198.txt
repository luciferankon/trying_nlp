Should we be using rehabilitation or incarceration for errant youth? Or a combination of both? Many feel that punishment is the only option for a teenager who commits a crime but what happens to that teen after they have been placed 'in the system'? Daniel Beaty moderates workshops with incarcerated youth to find out their feelings and suggestions. We also hear from former incarcerated youth directors of rehabilitation facilities and academics. There are no easy answers to our questions but perhaps hearing from the youth in Nebraska could help other states in formulating their Justice programs for juveniles.
