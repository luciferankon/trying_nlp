Rewa Singh (Tabu) and Sia Sheth (Sushmita Sen) are inseparable friends. Their bond has grown despite of Rewa's marriage to Dhruv Malhotra (Sanjay Suri). All rejoice when Rewa and Dhruv are expecting a baby. Complications arise and as a result Rewa loses the baby and is devastated all the more when told that she can no longer bear children. Sia comes to her rescue by making herself available as a surrogate mother. This uplifts Rewa's spirits and plans are afoot to make preparations for the forthcoming child. Then Sia starts having second thoughts of having to keep the child for herself; and an insecure Rewa starts doubting her husband who she feels is paying far too much attention on Sia.
