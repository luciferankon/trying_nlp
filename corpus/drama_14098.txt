Hagar is somewhat of an alien. Childless and unemployed Hagar cannot find her place in her small town community and in her own life as a newlywed. Only with Yiftach her 10 year old neighbor Hagar feels comfortable and unrestricted. The two stroll around the ruins of an abandoned village following a beautiful young soldier who train there. The boy is caught up in the magic of Hagar's game and helps her to come closer to her passions closer to herself and closer to a great tragedy.
