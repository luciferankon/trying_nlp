Experience the Divine in a series of underground documentary missions to bring God to our screens. The Mission Divine is the search for that which is not known. In The Mission Divine 6 video diarists undertake a mission to find God as best they can and persuade Him (or Her) to make some form of appearance as the pay-off at the end their journey. Each programme represents the highlights of the spiritual journey of a single contributor traveling through Brazil England Israel India and England.
