For the past twenty years Uganda has been in and out of newspaper headlines as a nation in brutal guerilla civil-war. Over 30000 child soldiers have conscripted by the Lord's Resistance Army a predominant rebel faction in the north to fight over political and ethnic issues that many of them may not be old enough to comprehend. Through the eyes of an American film-student Memorize-you-saw- it documents the society that stems from the collision of former child-soldiers in a small rural orphanage and middle-class american college students. It explores both the impact that violence and abuse have had on a whole generation of growing young adults and the complicated effects the humanitarian aid effort is having on a culture of desperate people. Cross-cultural communication is an underlying theme of the film as the filmmaker documents his constant struggle to understand his subject's problems and their dreams while trying to keep from ultimately disappointing them when he leaves.
