It is a talk show it is structured like a light-hearted debate where two groups bring forth their own point of views and try to out-smart the other team with their argument. The show begins with Gopinath introducing the topic and the participants. After brief introduction Gopinath starts the debate by firing questions at the one of the groups and response to the questions followed by the challenge by the other group forms rest of the show. Often some participants 'act' out relevant situations to express their point better which make the show more entertaining. After near 2 hours of debate Gopinath concludes the show by expressing his personal observation and several facts and points of consideration from the participation. The sponsor of the show would often honor a participant with a small prize at the end. A unique 'light hearted' talk show called 'Neeya? Naana?' (You? or Me?) telecast every Sunday at 9.30 pm to 11 pm. Polarized sections of the society debate on a topic that affects them the most and they share their views opinions and counter-arguments... All of which will all be presented in a stylized format. Every week one topic is chosen and two groups of people representing the extreme ends face each other and discuss on the show. Apart from the general 'potta-potti' (big fight) the show will also have celebrity visits public polls competitions to make it more interesting. Stories like "Is fan-club for film stars required? Not required?" "Ghosts- do they exist or they don't?" and more will be up for debate. The host Gopinath is all set to for the debate... Neeya? Naana?
