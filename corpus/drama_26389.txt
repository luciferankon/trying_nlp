Yao (Madi Diocou) and Moroccan Rachid (Soufiane Ouaarab) arrive illegally in Valencia Spain and separate. Yao sells pirated DVDs in the street and wanders disconsolately around the barrio until he glimpses divorcee Maria Luisa (Marisa Paredes) working in her boutique. High-strung and irritable Maria lives with her gay son Rober (Nao Albet) who like many other things in life is a disappointment to her. Rachid meanwhile is doing just fine working as a hairstylist in a beauty salon; Rober is hopelessly in love with him. When Yao starts sleeping in Rober's flat a confrontation between him and Maria suddenly becomes inevitable and when it comes what could have been an embarrassment is actually handled with grace.
