Shila and Rahul have been married recently. Being a lower-middle-class family they could not afford to get all the things needed to furnish a house. There is no dressing table in the house. One day Rahul brings an old dressing table. Albeit an old one Shila is still happy with it. Next day while cleaning the dressing table she finds an old diary. At first Shaila hesitates about whether she should read the diary as it belongs to someone else but one night she gives in to her curiosity. After finding the first 2/3 pages interesting she ends up reading the whole diary by the end of the night. After finishing the diary Shila walks towards the dressing table. She looks at the mirror and discovers herself. Then starts a new chapter in her life.
