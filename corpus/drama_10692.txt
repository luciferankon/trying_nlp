Heera (Girish Karnad) lives with his adopted brother Brindavan Biharilal (Mazhar Khan). While Brinda is employed with Ram Pyare Misra (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) Heera drives his car as a private taxi. One night Brindavan sees Mrs. Misra running away with the family jewellery he tries to stop her but she does not. She gets away in Heera's car. When Misra finds out he is enraged and has Brindavan beaten-up. He is also angry with Heera for transporting his wife and vows to take over his car by hook or by crook. One day Heera meets with Champa (Rameswari) and both fall in love and get married. Shortly after that Heera meets with an accident and his arms get paralyzed. Brindavan takes to driving the car and becomes the sole earner of this family. Misra takes advantage of this and manipulates Brindavan into taking a loan by pawning the car which Brindavan does so. Then Misra spreads rumors about Brindavan and Champa having an illicit affair. Heera gets taken in by these rumors. Misra then asks the villagers that the only way Champa can redeem herself is to place her hands in boiling oil.
