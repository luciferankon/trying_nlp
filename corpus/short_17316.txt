Danny Belrose used to be junkie now he is on call 24 hours a day. When somebody dies he goes to pick up the body. For 2 weeks the film maker rode along with him on these calls and interviewed him. During this time one of Danny's friends overdoses on heroin and he takes the call to transport her corpse to the funeral home.
