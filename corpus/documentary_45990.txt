The historic Cliff House stands perched on a headland atop the cliffs on the northwestern edge of San Francisco California. Originally built in 1863 it is now a key part of the Sutro Historic District. That district included the lavish gardens and structures of Sutro Heights the home of Adolph Sutro entrepreneur real estate developer and populist mayor of San Francisco now a park. The ruins just north of the Cliff house housed the world-class swimming pool and museum complex called Sutro Baths. A major amusement park San Francisco's Playland at the Beach once spilled over more than five city blocks south across from Ocean Beach. The Cliff House has been rebuilt or remodeled many times through its century and a half of operation.
