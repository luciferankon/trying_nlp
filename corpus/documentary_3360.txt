This documentary profiles Indigenous leaders in their quest for justice as they seek to establish dialogue with the Canadian government. By tracing the history of their ancestors since the signing of Treaty No. 9 these leaders aim to raise awareness about issues vital to First Nations in Canada: respect for and protection of their lands and their natural resources and the right to hunt and fish so that their societies can prosper. In recent years an awareness-raising movement has been surfacing in First Nations communities. In this powerful documentary those who refuse to surrender are given a chance to speak out.
