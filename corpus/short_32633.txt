In Search of the Obelisk is the first part of a three part interactive 'show' that played at the Luxor Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. In Search of the Obelisk is a short film in which a team of intrepid archaeologists discover an ancient pyramid in the Nevada Desert and discover massive caverns filled with advanced alien technology which then morphs into an interactive film experience where the characters talk to the audience in real time as the first motion control 'ride' begins.
