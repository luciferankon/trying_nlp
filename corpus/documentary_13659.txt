THE ULTIMATE WAVE TAHITI plunges audiences into the stunning beauty of an island paradise on a quest to find the perfect wave-riding experience. Nine-time world surfing champion Kelly Slater and Tahitian surfer Raimana Van Bastolaer and a group of friends seek out the best waves breaking on the reef at Tahiti's famed surf site Teahupo'o. As their quest unfolds the audience is plunged beneath the surface of things to explore the hidden forces at work shaping ocean waves and the islands that lie in their path. Amidst playful surfing action we navigate the cosmos and an ocean storm in a search for the source and nature of a wave's energy. Exploring mountainous Tahiti we are thrust into the turbulent volcanic past of the island and its neighbors and discover the seagoing wave-riding roots of the islanders themselves -- a culture still rich in the music dance and lore of the sea. Beneath the ocean swimming with our surfers we explore the stunning fragile beauty of the reef habitat -- a turbulent wave-shaping interface that envelops the island and nurtures the ocean's multitudes in motion -- fish dolphins sharks and whales. When the truly big surf arrives at Teahupo'o surfing play becomes surfing survival as the riders artfully tackle some of the heaviest surf on the planet -- spectacularly captured for the giant screen for the first time.
