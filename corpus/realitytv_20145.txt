A wild ride through the lives of some of the world's best surfers as they spend a not so typical two weeks traveling up and down the world's most pristine coastlines. Donavon Frankenrieter Benji Weatherley Pat O'Connell Kalani Robb and one of Australia's brightest up and comers Yadin Nicol make up the crew of Drive Thru Caribbean. Fortunately for them they were guided by Puerto Rico's own Otto Flores Jamaica legend Billy Wilmott and one of Barbados' top surfers Stuart Stout. Creator Greg Browning executive producer Taylor Steele along with series editor Matt Beauchesne(Campaign 12) motion graphics animator Jeff Motyll and artist Brendan Raasch have put together the 7th installment in the series and no doubt one of the best.
