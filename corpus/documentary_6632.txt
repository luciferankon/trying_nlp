In May 1937 Amelia Earhart embarked on the most ambitious and dangerous flight of her career: an attempt to fly around the world at the equator. Six weeks later she and her navigator Fred Noonan disappeared without a trace in the South Pacific. In "The Final Hours" we take a journey around the world in a vintage Lockheed Electra recreating Amelia's flight and reliving the adventure through her diaries and logbooks. Through interviews with aviation experts and historians we discover a possible solution to the mystery of her disappearance.
