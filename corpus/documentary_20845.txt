As Niagara Falls transformed from honeymoon capital of the world to Las Vegas North corporate hotel chains and casinos cast a long shadow over the independent motels that once populated the town. The Continental survived the transition by converting its rooms into affordable housing units becoming a home for those with few places to go. The night manager Brian once a freelance photographer who survived the horrors of war in Vietnam shares his duties with his colleague Linda. Together they manage both the Continental and the individual struggles of its tenants providing more than a roof over the heads of those who live under their supervision. Bringing a fresh focus to one of the most photographed places on Earth director and cinematographer Jesse McCracken develops an intimate and caring portrait of the residents of this modest micro-community set against the backdrop of neon-lit tourist attractions.
