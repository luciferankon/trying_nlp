What is the theme of the Surreality Show you ask? This is a satirical show featuring a set of entirely fictional Youtube personalities who don't exist in real life. Now we are kindly asking you to read back the previous sentence and make sense of it. This is what Surreality is about. The show features Marci accompanied by the showman Bobek the two of whom endeavour to explore and illuminate the darkest sites on the internet alongside introducing them to the viewer. Be it cultural trends people or recent news - if they deserve criticism Surreality gives it to them for sure.
