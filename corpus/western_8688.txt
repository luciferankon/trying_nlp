Trouble on the Trail is two episodes of the "Wild Bill Hickok" television series edited together and released as a feature film by Allied Artists. The first half has Jingles (Andy Devine) framed on a murder charge which Wild Bill Hickok (Guy Madison) reveals to be part of a plot to get control of valuable mine property. Riding on Wild Bill and Jingles aid in the return of a cafe singer (Martha Hyer) kidnapped by a gang trying to get control of another mine which proves the two episodes were not shown back-to-back on subsequent TV weeks as even the cheap Newhall Productions (William F. Broidy) wouldn't do two mine plots a week apart. No rescind that they probably would have figuring TV addicts wouldn't remember last week's plot anyway.
