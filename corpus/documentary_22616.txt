Dancing With Myself (WT) is a film about three Berliners and their search for happiness - on and next to the dancefloor. All three are passionate dancers and spend many hours every week shaking their limbs. Maybe because the rest of life isn't as cheerful? Laurin (18) strolls alone through the Berlin night trying several semi-legal clubs always in search for "her" place to dance possibly for "her" man to love. For Mario (38) dancing is a stage complete with mirror ball and laser show where he hopes to forget his lack of employment and be somebody. Reinhard (62) is in search of himself and a rather more spiritual way of dancing - in self-help groups and express-yourself-through-dancing ensembles. His dancing began when he watched the movie Alexis Sorbas. The film encouraged him to accept his personal destiny. He still dances the Sirtaki at least once a week.
