Early in the 21st century a small town Sheridan in Northern Wyoming decides it must change how it cares for its elders and its frail. More retirees are arriving; more people with disabilities and frailties need home care. What might they do? In 2004 community leaders see a glimpse of what their town's future could become. They watch a video that depicts the very first Green House Project model built for elders in Tupelo Mississippi. Though the challenge of creating these new homes without outside institutional support is daunting the community forms a task force and they proceed together to develop their vision. Just as they begin to raise the millions of dollars they will need for the project the economic crisis hits and severely threatens what they might accomplish. Still in spite of odds they persist.
