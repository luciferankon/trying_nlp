The bootstrap paradox refers to scenarios whereby items or information are passed from the future to the past which in turn then sent back to the same point in time again (either the original or a copy). This creates a circularity of cause-effect or a reductive causal loop such that the items or information have no discernible origin. The paradox raises the ontological questions of where when and by whom the items were created or the information derived.
