An anxious teacher (played as is the lead role in all his films by the director) sits in a beer garden on the hill of the Andechs monastery. While flies drown in his mug of beer he confronts a life of failure: the wife he ignored the child he neglected the teaching duties he has shirked and his doomed efforts at winning tenure from school officials. Only a dream from the past-the memory of a former liaison with a film star with whom he shared "the Andechs feeling a feeling that we are not alone" - provides sustenance. Despite an unexpected series of events longing in Achternbusch's world ultimately remains stronger than fulfillment and thirst better than beer.
