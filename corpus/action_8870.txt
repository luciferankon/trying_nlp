The game is simple - your fruits are blue and your opponent's are red. Slice blue fruits avoid the red fruits and keep an eye out for the elusive white fruits - these can be sliced by either opponent and award extra points! The combos are still in full force so you must bring your A game to the table and rack up some huge scores.
