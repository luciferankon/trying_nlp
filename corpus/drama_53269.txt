A famous author encourages his young writing students to live and write on the edge leading to a blurring of the boundaries between fact fiction and sanity. Celebrated author Ezra Rosen stages a comeback after a long respite by teaching what is supposed to be an on-line writing workshop. Instead he hosts the classes at his home seeking to revitalize himself and his storytelling by seducing his young students into a cult of writing and living dangerously. Rosen wastes no time preying upon the students' vulnerabilities via his unorthodox dogmatic approach to teaching writing. While his past achievements and charisma beguile two students in particular it doesn't take long for most to see that the great writer has lost the plot. Before long some of the students' stories generate a meta-narrative and wrestle control from their teacher. In losing his hold on his characters and the narrative Rosen also loses what little hold on sanity he still possesses. Yet he somehow finishes his latest novel suggesting that perhaps there was a method to his madness.
