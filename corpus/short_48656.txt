David is an academic struggling with his books and papers at home. Genevieve brings a gift back from work an ornamental bowl and places it upside-down on the table. David becomes convinced that something is under it and unwillingly takes it upon himself to confront it. He begins to question how far sensible rationality goes against a deathly anxiety - can you really talk yourself out of being scared? What if anything is under the bowl?
