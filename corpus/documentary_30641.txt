This film uses the powerful first person testimony of victims and private archive material alongside expert forensic psychologist opinion and an interview with a convicted fraudster to offer a unique insight into what drives those who betray and cheat. From false identities to fake terminal illnesses the programme investigates how intelligent and sensible victims can fall for a seemingly incredible web of lies and probes whether serial fraudsters are driven by criminal greed or their psychological flaws.
