Son of a Sri Lankan village farmer (Pathum Thilakasiri) (who is struggling to get on with his life) is in Australia for his University studies. The day before his final exam he received a message about his mother's death. According to Sri Lankan culture he cannot avoid his mother's funeral. Confused young man does not know what to do. His mind (Rukshani Ariyarathna) is all over the place. Luckily he realized the message about his mother is a false alarm.
