Damien seventeen sets out to see the lighthouse he's dreamed about forever: Ar-Men the gate to the Atlantic high seas. To do so he convinces Marine the bartender of his regular bar to introduce him to Jean-Marc a fisherman who needs a sailor. Though his father is very reserved about his son's plans Damien sets sail for a inshore fishing trip keeping his true motives a secret from Jean-Marc. It's dark when the voyage begins and at dusk all of the coastal marks have vanished. The only thing that remains is the sea the great desert. Soon Jean-Marc prepares his equipment: weighted poles are thrown like javelins overboard; dozens of nets dive into the water - hundreds of yards of ropes and thousands of miles of mesh. Damien who keeps looking at the horizon suddenly doubts their destination. When he asks Jean-Marc whether or not they go to Ar-Men the answer is a firm no. As the weather changes Damien now becomes seasick so Jean-Marc has to pull the nets back in on his own. However Damien has a sudden burst of energy and helps to sort out the different species of fish. When back in the harbor he even unloads the crates as if he's done it his whole life. Before leaving each other Jean-Marc explains to Damien that Ar-Men is not in his fishing range that only ships aiming the Irish Sea pass through it and that it's always on work purposes. It seems that Damien has changed because this is likely the first time he truly listens to someone. His share of fish is probably not the only thing he gained on his journey.
