Just how real are people on reality shows.... are they still "real people" when they know they have a camera in their face? What if they didn't know. To find out we went in search of 6 people to let us invade their lives 24 hours a day 7 days a week for 3 months. We told them they would be followed around by cameras every where they went... what we didn't tell them was that the Castle we were moving them into was wired with Hidden Cameras. They just assumed (as we hoped) that when the camera crew left the room they were off camera. Reality TV has finally crossed the line.
