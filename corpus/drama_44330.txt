The story is a simple tale based on a simple village. Shambhu is a small boy raised up by his mother and grandfather. Shambhu is extremely mischievous and does things. Everybody in the village knows each other and all share a common feeling of love and concern for each other. But Shambhu belongs to lower caste and so every time he and his family is met with intense insult. Social stigmas like caste discrimination were strongly prevalent in those times. Purna DA loves him but also hates his naughty ways. Meanwhile a Brahmin high class family residing in the same village too is plagued by problems of their own. One of the two sons of the family does not like earning a livelihood simply by performing prayers around. He does not learn his scriptures well or anything expected from a Brahmin boy. His family falls in trouble often and is considered the laughing stock for this.
