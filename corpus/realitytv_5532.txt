Modern Monarchy: Here & There begins with a recent visit by BBC reporter and Royal Expert Laura Trevelyan to an exhibit that features Diana's stunning wedding dress and other important items from the Royal Wedding of Prince Charles and Diana in 1981- inspiring speculation about whose fashion footsteps Kate might follow in. Then takes a look at America's very own Royal Wallis Simpson who married Edward VIII and for whom the prince abdicated the throne. Simpson's storied history was recently highlighted in the Golden Globe nominated film The King's Speech and now using archival footage and interviews with people who knew her the special delves deeper into the life of the American divorcee who stole the heart of a King and almost brought about the downfall of the Crown. The final piece explores Britain's relationship with the monarchy as seen through the eyes of Americans living in London and whether Kate will be the Royal who finally makes monarchists out of a nation of republicans.
