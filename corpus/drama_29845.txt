Tour rep Brad (Danny Dyer) is determined to win the informal competition among the male reps to sleep with as many female clients as possible while his friend Mikey (Des Coleman) is looking for true love. Brad gradually learns responsibility and human concern from the awful examples set by corrupt manageress Alison (Davinia Taylor) and self-serving treacherous super-stud Mario (Rik Young). Along the way we get some memorably gross-jokes and one or two moments of rather touching tenderness as well as a convincing portrait of what people go to Ibiza for--loud large times of music and drunken excess. Brad is convincing as a young man who learns better from experience and Des Coleman makes Mikey a three-dimensional soulful romantic with a wicked sense of humor rather than merely good personified.
