Michelin-starred pub landlord Tom Kerridge is back with a new episode of Food & Drink. Forget your pilaffs and paellas - this edition is all about the best of British food. Tom is joined by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall - a passionate champion of British dishes. He cooks a classic roast chicken to go up against Tom's great British stew and dumplings. Oliver Peyton puts cured meats from Blighty under the spotlight and drinks expert Joe Wadsack tastes a wine made in London before we find out whether Tom's stew or Hugh's chicken is the best British dish.
