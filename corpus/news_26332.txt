Nerd Caliber focuses on nerd lifestyle meaning not only do we report about some of the latest releases in the world of books and film but we also focus on what makes all of us special. We are living in a world where change is constantly happening. Definitions of what is steampunk cosplay or even nerd and geek are constantly in flux. Our goal at Nerd Caliber is to explore our culture and not only question its definition but to see where it will lead us years from now.
