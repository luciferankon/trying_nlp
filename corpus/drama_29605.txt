Athens today. Three siblings face the prospect of selling their family home. The potential buyers will tear it down and erect a modern building in its place. Alexis defends the sale documenting his position with the financial benefits that this will bring. Anna reacts negatively. For her their family home is the memory of her childhood. Amalia hesitates in making a decision trapped between her emotional reservations and the practical needs. The heroes are in conflict with themselves in a city that is in conflict with the memory of its history. The sale of the family home functions as a pretext for the heroes to bring to light their interpersonal relations. The image they have of each other in absentia the "non dit" that characterizes family ties and reveals raw wounds when the surface of childhood is scratched. A surface sprinkled with gold dust like a fairytale. But the fairytale is weakened by a chance occurrence. A message from the past functions as a catalyst prompting the heroes to make their own mark in their own age. To find a balance between the debt of memory and the debt of forgetfulness. To come of age taking the present of their own lives in their hands.
