The two best friends Mischa Sigtermans and Wijnand Huis were tired of having to be busy with their phones all the time. For this reason they came up with a plan: 'Project Naptime'. The rules were simple; being dropped in unfamiliar territory with no phones money food and no place to stay. During 'Project Naptime in the USA' the two friends take you along to relive their epic trip through different states of America where they experienced their most unforgettable adventures. They relied on strangers and their generosity. Many of these strangers would later become their friends.
