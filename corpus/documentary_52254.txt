In this dramatic follow-up to UNDER OUR SKIN EMERGENCE takes the viewer on a journey from horror to hope. We witness the emerging epidemic of Lyme disease as infection and education spread globally. We watch as the truth emerges about the disease's persistence and reach about promising new research and about medical collusion and conflicts of interest that continue to impede progress. We revisit the characters from UNDER OUR SKIN as they emerge into better health reclaiming their lives and dignity and offering hope to the legions now suffering. As Lyme disease surges EMERGENCE shines a probing light on the issue and becomes a beacon in the dark.
