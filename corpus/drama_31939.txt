A filmization of a typical burlesque shown offered from the stage of a Los Angeles theatre. The genre tag of "drama" does not apply as the only drama is whether Lili will shed all or not. (She doesn't.) It might since there is no Burlesque genre pass as a musical...until one hears the orchestra. Just another of a long line of "burlesque movies" shot on the cheap and sold to the bottom-of-the-barrel theatres which served to add a second meaning to the term "grind house." Some of the listed performers were still bumping-and-grinding in schlock pictures into the 70's and later.
