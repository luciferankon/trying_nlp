Servants' Entrance is a 1934 American Pre-Code musical comedy film. The movie was written by Samson Raphaelson from the Sigrid Boo novel and directed by Frank Lloyd with a cartoon sequence by Walt Disney in which an understandably startled Janet Gaynor sings a song while obstreperous animated singing silverware prance around on her bed an early example of combining live action with animation. Critics found this musical interlude especially charming.
