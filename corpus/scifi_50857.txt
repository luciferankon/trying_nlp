When big city newspaper reporter Vanessa Trojan goes to a small backwater town named Anywhere Washington to do a feature article on two female Street Racing icons she doesn't realize that this will be the last article she ever writes. When the icons - the always talkative Jo Leene Dodge and Betty Petty (unable to speak) take Vanessa to a ruckus rockabilly house party a strange light appears from the sky and people start to feel sick. The party ends in a vicious brawl between Jo Leene and jealous rival Vikki Lee. The next day Jo Leene is accused of killing Vikki Lee who has disappeared with only her severed fingers found on the seat of her wrecked car. As more people turn up missing or murdered Anywhere's only detective Detective LLoyd soon realizes that this is not a simple murder case but something much much bigger.
