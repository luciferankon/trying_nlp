Peter the tramp ('Karel Lamac' (qv)) wants to end his life but he isn't successful in doing so. After his third attempt at suicide he jumps under a car but the owner and driver Jirí Landa ('Karel Lamac' (qv) again) brakes in time. He notices their similar builds and gives Peter a winter coat. In the pocket is a forgotten invitation to a ball where Jirí is to meet his future bride Anicka Karesová ('Anny Ondra' (qv)) for the first time. Peter goes to the ball instead of Jirí and immediately wins the favour of Anicka and her father ('Theodor Pistek (I)' (qv)).
