A series of mysterious murders confounds the country's secret services as they investigate discreetly but persistently every aspect of the case. With the help of a number of coincidences it is revealed that the crimes are connected to the activity of foreign agents who operate in Greece. In the end all these agents - although their origin is not specified - try to obtain valuable ultra-top-secret documents that are related to certain "serious" experiments that are being secretly performed on a NATO military base.
