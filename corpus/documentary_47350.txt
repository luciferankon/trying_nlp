Life magazine photos are used as the inspiration for the re-telling of some compelling holiday stories including: USO footage of Bob Hope entertaining American troops and visiting wounded soldiers on the battlefront; the astronauts who piloted the risky Apollo 8 Christmas Eve mission to the dark side of the moon; mill owner Aaron Feuerstein who saved Christmas for Lawrence Massachusetts; a movement against racial discrimination in Billings Montana; a reunion for adoptive families and their Romanian children; how the Boys Choir of Harlem profoundly changed the life of one of its members; and a tribute to Jimmy Stewart.
