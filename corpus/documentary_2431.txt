The Everyday is a one-hour program documenting the lives of the monks living at Mount Saviour Monastery in Elmira New York. The program shot over the course of five years is an invitation into the private and holy existence of monks. The Everyday explores the monastic attitudes toward everyday secular issues such as work commitment and love. The monks offer insights to the joys and the disappointments of monastic life and in the process lay down the groundwork for a new way of thinking about our own 'everyday' lives. "The Everyday" is a profile of six monks and their quest to achieve the extraordinary by doing the ordinary faithfully everyday.
