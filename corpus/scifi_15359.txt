A man alone abandoned by life suspended between the present the past and the future. A man who has sacrificed his family at the altar of ambition. A man who can at last recognize his mistakes and who is determined to win back everything that is dear to him. Mercurio is a journey back in time and through memories a journey searching for the essence of life itself through worlds and undefined realities where fashions settings and characters melt together in a puzzle of eras and styles that runs throughout the 19th Century.
