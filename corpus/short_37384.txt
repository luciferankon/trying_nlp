A four engined propeller airliner with 50 passengers on board is flying cross country. Both pilots ate poisoned fish and were incompassated. Dana Andrews a passenger who flew fighters in the war is the only one who can fly and land the plane. He had problems in the war and is afraid to take the controls. Very gripping film.
