A documentary that addresses sexuality in people with functional diversity through six real stories which show that sex belongs to everybody. It explores not only what sexuality can do for the people with disabilities but what functional diversity may contribute to human sexuality. It breaks the pairing dependence-infantilization using explicit images that portray disabled people as sexual and sexed beings and as desiring and desirable bodies.
