Indie producer Julia Stemock took her professional frustrations and disappointments and made lemonade in the form of a newly released DVD/CDROM package entitled "The Basics of Filmmaking." The project is the fruit of an innovative 8-hour 3-table gabfest between more than 36 industry professionals that was organized and staged by Stemock with the idea of passing along the kind of practical real-world information that could save other aspiring filmmakers from costly mistakes errors in judgment or the fallout from ego-blindness.
