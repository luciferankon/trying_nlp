Metro depicts the life of four people a barman a lottery-ticket seller a security man and a cleaning lady who work in the Barcelona metro a maze of tunnels and passages which constitute a meeting place for over a million passengers per day and a lively social-life. Coffee shops gambling machines and kiosks take the form of a dynamic living city which is a dark copy of the city above. Through the portrait of this underground microcosm the film attempts to draw some conclusions on the above-ground Barcelona.
