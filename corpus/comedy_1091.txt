Bedtime Stories for Men is a comedy series with shades of action satirizing typically male-oriented genres and delving into fantasy worlds to illustrate a modern day dilemma. Late twenty somethings are moving back in with their parents in droves and although they're loved it's becoming harder and harder to get them to seek their independence. If they won't take a hint maybe they'll take a bed time story.
