In the tone of No Country for Old Men and History of Violence: A priest trying to atone for his bloody past as a special ops soldier witnesses the brutal murder of members from his congregation by a malevolent Sheriff and his deputies. Tortured and left for dead in the desert he survives. Then he faces a crisis of conscience and the dawning realization that his past military training and three tours in Afghanistan may have been preparation for what his soul and his heart tell him is right. From there it goes all bad for the crooked cops.
