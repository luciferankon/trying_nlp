In a world where it is more important that a politician looks good on camera - and has "great hair"- a clueless childlike womanizing yet very popular U.S. Senator (who was elected for the first time 12 years ago as a joke because he played a Senator on a very popular soap opera) comes up with a plan to save the country from the impending financial doom created by Medicare and Social Security. His plan is to send all the old and sick Americans to a giant island -never to be seen or heard from again. This plan is called " ISLANDCARE". Along the way he faces much resistance.
