Ziyad and Maryam are a happy young couple in Lebanon yet after three years of marriage they remain childless. Due to intense family pressure they try everything they can but eventually learn that Maryam is infertile. Ziyad repeatedly reassures her of his undying love but family and social pressure particularly his evil meddling mother gradually poison their happy relationship until the love enthusiasm and humour of their early days soon take a tragic turn.
