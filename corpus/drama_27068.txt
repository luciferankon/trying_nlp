Montreal 1954. There is a rumor that a black market selling illegitimate babies would exist in Quebec. A special squad is formed and quickly Edgar McCoy and his team discover a clandestine organization that sells newborns and whose ramifications extend to the United States. At the same time in Tadoussac the life of the young Gabrielle HÃ©bert tilts when she gets pregnant without being married. She goes into exile in Montreal where she finds refuge at the Redemption Hospital. Driven by the desire to find her lover and especially to keep her child Gabrielle flees the establishment and finds herself in the midst of a large-scale police investigation that will expose this odious traffic. This series is freely inspired by real events. In the 1950s more than a thousand babies were sold in a black market of newborns between New York and Montreal. Wealthy Americans were willing to pay up to $ 15000 to buy a child. Private clinics in the metropolis "found" the children in question and even procured them false papers to legalize the adoption. The events that inspired the series will be the subject of a documentary broadcast on the Historia channel.
