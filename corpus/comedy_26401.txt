Sunil Mehta gets stuck in a giant ferris wheel with an attractive young woman all night due to power failure. He arrives home the next day and meets a very suspicious wife Geeta who knows that he has been up to no good. She refuses to believe his story about the stalled ferris wheel and he invents a story about spending the night with a fictitious friend named Champak Boomia. Geeta does not believe that he ever has a friend by that name and decides to write to him to come and visit her. Sunil then convinces his friend Amit Desai to pretend that he is Champak and thus convince Geeta that he was indeed telling the truth. Amit agrees to do so and everything goes according to plan - until a real and amorous Champak Boomia shows up - resulting in hilarious chaos.
