Imagine you are blind. Imagine you are utterly dependent on an animal - your guide-dog - to make sense of the world around you. And then imagine your guide-dog disappears. That's what happens to army veteran Mal Walker on a tough council estate called Greyhawk. But Mal is pretty tough himself and he's not going to let a little thing like blindness stop him finding his best friend.
