My name is Chiho SATO I live in France since 2010. I was born and raised in FUKUSHIMA. My whole family lives only 60 km away from FUKUSHIMA DAI-ICHI nuclear plant in an area called : "The Voluntary Evacuation Zone". More than four years after the disaster the invisible radioactivity is still omnipresent but gradually vanishing from the locals 's mind. Unlike the apocalyptic and anxiety-provoking images often shown in Europe I'd like to make an intimate documentary with genuine stories coming from the people who live in one of the most radioactive places on earth. My aim is to reignite a debate regarding Fukushima's situation including the voices of the locals. The explosion of FUKUSHIMA DAI-ICHI's nuclear reactor that occurred on March 11 2011 had a large impact on the public's opinion against nuclear energy. Some countries even changed their energy plan as did Germany. Many demonstrations and anti-nuclear movements shouting indignation were seen across the world. But what have we heard from the first concerned: the people from FUKUSHIMA.
