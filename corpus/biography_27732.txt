In 1815 the Battle of Waterloo ended the Napoleonic age and restored the Bourbon monarchy to the throne of France. But the revolutionary spirit of 1789 refused to disappear and the next decades saw France bitterly divided between conservative and revolutionary factions. This divided age produced some of the greatest achievements in French painting and literature. Dominating these achievements were the novels of Honore de Balzac a French journalist and writer who is regarded as one of the creators of realism in literature. Balzac's dream was to become a writer and after publishing six novelettes entitled Scenes de la Vie Privee he came up with the idea to create an amazing work of literature entitled La Comedie Humaine which includes his masterpieces Le Pere Goriot Les Illusions Perdues Les Paysans La Femme de Trente Ans and Eugene Grandet. Although this major task was never completed it was a unique achievement and comprised of 90 novels and novellas and featured more than 2000 characters.
