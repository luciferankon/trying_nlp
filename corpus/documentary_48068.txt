I'm gay I'm Muslim I'm a drag queen I'm British and Pakistani said Asif Quraishi Britain's first out and proud Muslim drag queen who performs under the glamorous alter ego Asifa Lahore. "People say these things shouldn't fit together but hey here I am." Now Quaraishi and his fellow artistes have been promised police protection amid fears that a Channel 4 documentary shining a spotlight on the "hidden" community of gay British Asians could provoke a violent response. Quraishi 33 from Southall West London performs a provocative act in which he strips off a Burka and has received death threats from fellow Muslims.
