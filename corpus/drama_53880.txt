The stories of three men get tangled up in the life of the young Gipsy called Magdalena - that of the Bulgarian Lilyanin who starts off as a fighter for brotherhood but turns into a persecutor of the Gypsies; the story of the savage Halibryamov who knows the language of animals but does not speak any human tongue; the story of a rich Gypsy called Kanyo who wants but does not dare to break with the lot of his kin and story of a Frenchman in a wheelchair who comes to realize that money cannot buy everything. Magic alone can unravel this knot of destinies... And then there is the Gypsy tale of the black swallow and how it came to be.
