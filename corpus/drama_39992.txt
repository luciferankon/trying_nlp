Naive illiterate Bhola Nath lives in a small village in India which has yet to receive electricity. Bhola is helpful to everyone around him and even speaks out against the local politician Chatriprasad. Perturbed by this Chatriprasad first accedes to all of Bhola's demands and then asks him to re-locate to Bombay and find employment with a former villager named Jagganath Tripathi to which Bhola agrees. Upon arrival Bhola is welcomed by Jagganath and is even hired to escort young women to meet with their brothers. Bhola enthusiastically takes on this opportunity and works diligently to earn the respect of everyone around him. During the course of his duties he meets with a beautiful woman named Roopali and it is then slowly it dawns on Bhola about the true nature of his duties - that a pimp. But will this realization be enough for Bhola to reverse the regression in order to redeem himself?
