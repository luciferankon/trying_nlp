Welcome to Aurora. A medieval world plagued by ever-present lightning. Cities and roads bristle with lightning spires as protection from charged skies. In thunderous battles metal shards are catapulted over enemy armies summoning lightning from the clouds. An obsidian humanoid race the Inazuma feed on lightning. And yet an order of human warrior monks Masters of electrical weaponry and physics use it to fight and heal. Shotoku is a naive warrior in this world and after killing his own brother Shotoku vows to never use his tremendous electromagnetic powers again. But on the eve of invasion as allies turn traitor and danger looms from all sides can he hold his oath? An enemy warrior princess Makiko may help him find balance and when his principles falter his roguish friend Jirai will deliver salvation. But only Shotoku can decide. Will he shatter his vow unleash his chaotic power and face the invaders alone? Or honor his oath and gain the new allies that might save his world?
