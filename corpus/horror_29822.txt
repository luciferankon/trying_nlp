It's "Last House on the Left" meets "The Desperate Hours" when four escaped cons enter an isolated safe-house retreat for abused women. Some have called it an exercise in depravity while others have deemed it to be an illustration of the strength that exists in all women. No matter how you view it "Slaughter House" is a 90 minute odyssey of absolute terror! Don't watch it alone!
