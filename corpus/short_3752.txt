Under the N is the story of a 30 year old working class native of Astoria (an area in Queens NY experiencing widespread gentrification) named Al. A loser in love art and his job Al is pushed over the edge when a fight with his ex turns ugly and he loses a treasured link to his past. Even in encounters with a pathetic drunk and a pair of friends who have surrendered to premature middle-age his own life does not compare favorably enough to continue. Can a weak bladder induced chance encounter with a free spirited DJ in a bar bathroom convince Al to go on?
