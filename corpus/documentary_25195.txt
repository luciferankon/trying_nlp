The young Danish band 'The William Blakes' have made it into something of a dogma to record their albums in no time and under the dictate of certain changing rules in a house in BÃ¶sebo in Sweden 300 km from Copenhagen. The same is true for their latest record 'The Way of the Warrior' which took nine days to 'invent' helped by the rule that for each time somebody said 'no' one should say 'yes'. The film follows the band during these nine days and portrays four witty guys and their both thought-provoking and funny musical discussions embellished in a melancholy winter atmosphere. The record was awarded the prize as the best rock album of the year in Denmark.
