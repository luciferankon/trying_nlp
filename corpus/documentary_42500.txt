Hainan is the holiday paradise in the Middle Kingdom: Chinas only tropical island lures visitors with endless white sandy beaches palm trees and pineapple. Hainan was once an almost pristine island in the South China Sea. But ever since around 13 million holidaymakers almost exclusively Chinese fly to the dream island its days as an idyll are numbered. Typical Hainan tourists love crowds and like to wear conspicuous clothes: leisure combinations reminiscent of pyjamas in garish bright colours and a parasol as nothing would be more embarrassing than returning home with a suntan. Hainan is located in the tropics 2500 kilometres south of Beijing. The dream island of the Chinese is roughly the same size as Belgium and is home to more than eight million inhabitants. Actually it borders on a miracle that Hainan has become a tourist magnet as in almost all Chinese dynasties the island formerly served as an exile for disgraced civil servants.
