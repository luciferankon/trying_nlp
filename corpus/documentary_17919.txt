Shelter Me: New Beginnings is hosted by Allison Janney and features volunteer pilots that fly shelter pets to safety. We also see a nationally recognized animal trainer who teaches shelters how to safely implement play groups for dogs. The goal is get each dog out of their kennel to play in groups every day. These play groups enhance the health and well-being of the dogs and dramatically increases their chances for adoption.
