Didier Noirot and Roger Horrocks take us on an expedition 'Into the Dragon's Lair' to explore the one hundred meter deep papyrus caves of Botswana's Okavango delta and the actual lairs where the giant Nile crocodile drag their prey. They set out to understand and document the underwater behaviour of these wild reptiles while exploring the fears and fascinations that humans have with crocodiles. They confront our ultimate nightmares and transform them into scientific understanding and beauty.
