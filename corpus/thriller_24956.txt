A man is accused of killing a policeman in his art gallery and his court case is getting closer to conviction. The judge presiding over the case starts getting phone calls that tell her to set the process to a direction which would release the gallery owner and is informed that she is being closely followed and can't tell anyone of her situation. She resists at first but then she witnesses the kidnap of her daughter and is told that in exchange for her daughter she must do what she was told to do. Despite the constraints she quietly begins to investigate with a police detective and both discover that there's decidedly more to it than just a simple demand for the gallery owner's release while at the same time her daughter's kidnappers' pressure on her steadily increases.
