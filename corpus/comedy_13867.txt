There's no place like home. And to many of the patrons of a popular Palm Springs restaurant Shame on the Moon is home. But something seems off tonight. Is it a full moon? Is it the crazy notion of running pink squirrels as the bar special? Or is it the short staff that has Jimmy doing double duty as both waiter and bartender? The daffy cast of regulars - plus a few unsuspecting newcomers - have jimmy running in circles but there's also trouble at the home with his boyfriend Terry and a little cutie that could claw them apart. Ultimatums have been delivered so tonight's shift could spell the end of Jimmy's career not to mention his happy home. There's chaos in the kitchen a backup at the bar and no shortage of attitude and sass as Jimmy circumnavigates the squirrelly dramas unfolding at each table. By nights end however Jimmy again grasps the meaning of an old truth: there's no place like home.
