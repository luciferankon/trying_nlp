Return to Zion Ranch" is an allegorical story of Israel set in a western setting on a ranch called Zion's Ranch. Jacob Israel is the father of twelve sons who become discontent with their simple yet blessed lives on the ranch. They disperse out into the world going after gold and a more exciting life. But in the end it would prove to be a dissatisfied and empty life. Hearing that the ranch had been taken over by Phil Stine's renegades and that their youngest brother is badly hurt they all return to live by the charge (God's standard) given to them by their father.
