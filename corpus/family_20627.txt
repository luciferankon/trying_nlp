Once upon a time there were twelve children who were born the same day in the village of Timgad in Algeria eleven boys and a girl Naďma the grocer's daughter. Over a decade later they were all in the same class under the iron rule of Mokhtar the secular schoolmaster. They also all played in the village soccer team founded by - Mokhtar. All except Naďma although she was itching to. But the families were poor and without decent shoes and worse without a competent coach the kids lost most of their games particularly against Batna their main rival. One day Jamel a young French-Algerian archaeologist from Marseilles landed in the remote village. And he was not that bad at soccer.
