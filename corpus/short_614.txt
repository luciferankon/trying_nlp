Do you ever wonder what is hidden behind a face what passions lie behind a person you would otherwise pass by without a thought what wonders opinions and artistic expressions can dwell in each nook and cranny of your city town or village? In a time of division a time of confusion and anguish it's time to start asking questions to be curious and compassionate and discover the common nature that connects us all. Words. One cold winters night in Leeds England we discovered Stan. We discovered love. We discovered anger. We discovered hidden talents. We discovered togetherness. We discovered poetry and passion. We discovered diversity. We discovered fish and chips. We discovered Stan's Fisheries. Extraordinary things exist in ordinary places. In a world of hope a world of pain a world of both tragedy and happiness if you have the words there's always a chance that you'll find the way to connect with people everyday people. In times of division we must remember that we are far more united than things which divide us. As the Jamaican national motto says "Out of many one people".
