Imagine a magician who reaches into his hat to pull out the rabbit he previously hid there and finds himself not with a bunny but a unicorn. By the time Jeff McBride was a teenager he was appearing on national TV. Since then he has won world renown among lovers of magic and illusion. Whether gracing a stage in Las Vegas or Paris performing a card trick under your nose or teaching a master class to already accomplished conjurers he is one of the contemporary masters of the arts of deception. He is also the follower of a spiritual path based on a form of magic that he says far from being a deceit is a path to sacred reality.
