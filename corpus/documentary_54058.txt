Thomas Quick believed to have been a serial killer having confessed to more than 30 murders while incarcerated in a mental institution for personality disorders. Convicted of eight of these murders between 1994-2001. These sentences was squashed 2010-2013. Details in the confessions were wildly wrong and Quick relied on hints and body language from his interrogators to guess the answers expected of him. One of his psychotherapists provided him with vital information regarding many of the murder cases he confessed to. The credibility of Quick's confessions was widely debated in the Swedish media. Critics of these confessions and the trials including a policeman involved in one of the investigations wrote that there was no evidence that tied Quick to any of the murders he had confessed and that until he could show something he had taken that belonged to one of his victims the probability was that he was a compulsive liar. In 2008 Thomas Quick reverted to his birth name Sture Bergwall. He was released from SÃ¤ter's institution for the criminally insane and most of the treatment plan has been made confidential and subject to secrecy.
