Rory is a professional photographer taking the best pictures of his life but he's not where he thought he'd be by now. At 42 Rory is part of Generation X - the invisible generation that has been overshadowed by Baby Boomers and Gen Yers. But every generation has their time and Gen X time is now. A journey of love photography & fine dining where Rory becomes a reluctant hero for a generation that's ready to be heard.
