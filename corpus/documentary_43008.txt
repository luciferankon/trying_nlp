Generations of parents have wondered why their children turn into obnoxious argumentative angst- ridden reckless lazy and rebellious monsters. Whatever! has the answers. Using a series of ground-breaking on-screen scientific tests we will tread where adults fear to go. This series will combine observational documentary of family life and teens behaving badly with carefully designed scientific challenges that put our teenagers to the test. Experts will be on hand to give physical physiological and psychological analysis of the way teenagers behave while we talk to teenagers and parents to give us a 360 degree view of the experiments and what they could mean in everyday life.
