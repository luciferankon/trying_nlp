Nahapet (meaning patriarch in Armenian) has lost his family his house and all his properties during the Armenian Genocide in 1915. Self-absorbed and reticent he's like a withered tree. The village on the slope of Mount Aragats where he finds shelter consists only of half-destroyed houses and sun-scorched earth. Could Nahapet find the inner strength to build a new house start a new family and revive the things cast away by his destiny? This eternal story of resurrection is symbolic for the Armenian nation's history.
