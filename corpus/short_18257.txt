Music Forward! is the order given by a lady in Colonial costume and in march a group of five musicians working industriously at their instruments. The directress stands them in a row and taking the head off each throws it onto a huge music staff and each becomes a note of the scale. The whole bodies appear again after which the manipulator seems to wrap them up in a large sheet of music which is then shown to contain nothing. The paper is rolled up again and a cane is held perpendicularly in a horizontal position to the sheet when the musicians each about one-twentieth of the natural stature issue from the paper and parade up and down the narrow stick. This done a pretty effect in human notes which are the players' heads is shown after which the little band and their directress march out again.
