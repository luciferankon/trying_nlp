After 30 years of a splendid career and exploring a variety of styles Al Di Meola still ranks among the most popular guitar-masters of jazz and jazz-rock. Here on his first "electric" DVD Di Meola shows up with "Speak A Volcano" in Leverkusen in November 2006. Surrounded by a band including his old companion and superb percussionist Gumbo Ortiz he rediscovers his love of the electric guitar without denying newer influences. The result is a balancing act between volcanic electronic ecstasy and emotionally moving sound excursions between fervent improvisations and intimate conversations including many compositions of Al Di Meola himself and five Piazzolla tunes.
