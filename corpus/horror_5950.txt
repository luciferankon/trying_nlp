Erica a 21-year-old psychology major learns she's inherited an abandoned lumberjack camp from her catatonic mother. She heads to the camp with her boyfriend and childhood friends to learn more about her family tree. Upon arriving the party of five engages in seedy behavior such as the ritualistic drinking drugs and sex. Everything is groovy until her boyfriend Chuck is brutally murdered by LOG - a rascally piece of wood that inexplicably springs to life with an insatiable thirst for blood and a penchant for buggery. Erica's sanity unspools faster than Chuck's intestines around Log's branch as her friends are all killed by Log and she's raped by his stubby branch. Erica births a bloody acorn and realizes that Log is her father. Erica and her oak embryo escape to a nearby road where she commandeers a logging truck and drives home - with Log secretly riding on the back. One year later Erica eats breakfast with Log and their daughter a bizarre log/human hybrid that feeds on blood.
