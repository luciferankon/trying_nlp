Some scenes from the life of Eduard Anseele the leading figure in the beginnings of the Socialist Party in Belgium. Brought to the screen in a theatrical rather then a realistic fashion with some scenes played by puppets. Originally this was a theater production played in Ghent Belgium with more or less the same cast.
