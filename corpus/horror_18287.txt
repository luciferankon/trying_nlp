The surrivors of the first film "House of deaths" join up with the owners of Mortimer house to travel to the Hellfire club to invite the worst of the worst to spend just one weekend in the house. When they initially refuse the invitation they are drugged and when they awake on the premises they are all tortured and killed according to their sins.
