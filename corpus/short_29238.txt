In a Welsh village the last of the local Gypsy musicians has died. The wind is blowing hard at the grave of Laszlo Ferencs as the priest a few friends and four musicians wait for the coffin to be lowered into the ground. The priest's words are difficult to hear in the wind as is the music of the players. But in the town the music is blowing in the wind; it descends on and enchants people as they repair a fence hang clothes to dry write a letter knit or sit for tea. The music breathes rhythm and delight into one and all including the sexton.
