A brother and sister sitting in a coffee bar bicker mildly about whose idea it was to come to Memphis and which kind of cigarette is fresher. Danny their waiter comes by offering refills; after determining they are twins he guesses which is the evil one. Without a pause he sits down and offers his theory about Elvis's twin. He drones on. The good twin finally speaks up giving her own opinion. The waiter is unfazed. After his boss finally calls him back to work the twins are free to resume their bickering amidst the coffee and cigarettes.
