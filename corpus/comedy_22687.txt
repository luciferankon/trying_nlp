Emile Brockton enjoys TV chicken pot pies and...well not much else. His life has become a meaningless procession of banal activities that prompt him to spice things up the only way he can devise: by killing himself. However the road to suicide is filled with distractions and these create the ultimate conundrum for him. It turns out there's quite a market for autobiographical snuff flicks and Emile's new acquaintance from work (who is a few tacos shy of a combo plate) decides to document his demise.
