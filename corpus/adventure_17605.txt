Patrick Malone and Gregg Miles were Korean-war buddies who "retired" to a life as beachcombers in Acapulco. When they weren't lounging around or chasing women they worked as bodyguards for Mr. Carver. Carver was retired from a long career as a crusading criminal lawyer and he was frequently threatened by enemies from his past.
