In her documentary on Hungarian-Slovak relations Vladislava Plancíková focuses on the word "felvidék" which refers to the now non-existent northern part of Austro-Hungary. In a personal collage consisting of the stories of members of her Slovak-Hungarian family and of visual references to historical events she follows the eventful and today often taboo history of the post-war fate of Hungarians on Slovak soil. The abstract topic grabs our interest not only through the witnesses' testimony but also by using thre novel technique of animating real objects including a number of contemporary and modern photographs.
