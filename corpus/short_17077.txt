The Impermanence of the Ordinary features photographer Patrick Cummins. Patrick documents a history of Toronto by capturing the changing surfaces of buildings over time. With over 40000 photographs of architectural details such as storefront signage facades and structural renovations taken since 1978 he continues to revisit photograph and contrast the subtle and drastic changes to the exterior of buildings. The images meticulously present a street-level perspective of a city in constant flux.
