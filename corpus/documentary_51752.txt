To promote blood donation for the Swiss Red Cross in Eritrea a country shaken by war Doc Redbeard (aka Martin Weber 58) puts his shirt on Beny. Beny (50) is an ultra-distance sport cyclist - and one armed. Through the cycle race Giro d'Eritrea they experience a for-gotten country full of surprise. Beny Furrer wants to cycle down the 1'100 kilometers of the Giro d'Eritrea as the ambassador of blood. His participation amongst a hundred young local cyclists should state that blood donation doesn't effect his performance. Even if he has only one arm and is at the age of 50. Sweat For Blood shows the incredible adventure of two real characters on their mission in the breath-taking scenery of East Africa.
