2014 is the year of the horse in the Tibetan calendar and Shakyamuni Buddha's year of his birth sign. According to Tibetan folklore you may double your merits and virtues if you circumambulate Mount Kailash this year. Kailash is holy mountain commonly recognized in many religions. In the hearts of believers that is the center of the world. The film is about the stories of five characters related to Mt Kailash: A young Living Buddha starts off his first long difficult journey of his lifetime with his friends to circumambulate Mt Kailash. A Beijing journalist is returning to this place of worship to complete the trek around the mountain despite his death kissing experience in the mountains a few years ago. A band of four local Tibetan women farmers are adopting the most difficult way in their circumambulation after their busy farming season. The local tour guide who has led hundreds around the mountain is making money as a guide and doing his pilgrims at the same time. Meanwhile a thousand kilometer away from Kailash a 83-year-old man is planning his trek around the mountain. He is a famous Tanka master in Tibet he can't forgive the mistake he made in 50 years ago. He hopes that such an arduous journey around the holy mountain will cleanse his sins.
