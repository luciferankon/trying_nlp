This program documents the history of the Railways in the Dalby area. Situated in the center of the Darling Downs Dalby was once the terminus of the Main Western Railway and the central hub for three branch lines. Today the main rail traffic is made up of coal hauled from Macalister however past traffic was much more interesting. Join us as we explore and travel these lines! AC16 class steam loco 221A will take us to Meandarra and other trains will take us to Glenmorgan. 2000 class rail motors make it to Bell and Jandowae and we will travel from Macalister to Bowenville with coal trains hauled by various diesel locos. Rich in history this program takes us right from the planning stages through to the present day - where the drought has caused the Dalby Branch lines to lose all traffic leaving an uncertain future. As a bonus the trip to Meandarra and the coal trains running from Macalister are provided in separate programs free of narration or music.
