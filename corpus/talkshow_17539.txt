The Dream Team with Annabelle and Michael is a reality show in the vein of a Dr. Phil episode but dealing only with people's dreams. Both the dream 'analysts' Annabelle Gurwitch and Michael Lennox hear audience member's most intimate dreams many of them either bizarre or sexual and interpret what the dreams mean and what the people's own subconscious minds are trying to tell them.
