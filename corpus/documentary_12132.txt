As with many things it's the people their stories and their experiences that can best describe life aboard a narrowboat. Join us in this programme as we meet a wealth of characters and personalities who are united in their love of days spent on the canal. Life on a narrowboat may be taken at a slower pace but it is never dull - missing bridges ghostly goings-on undiscovered murders and more than a fair share of people falling overboard: these are the tales of life on the waterways.
