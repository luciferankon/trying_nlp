Caucasus. While labourers from Azerbaijan are working on the construction of a new high-speed train line intended to bring glory to future generations in Armenia a station master has been awaiting idle the return of the trains for 20 years beyond a closed border in an abandoned depot. In a landscape whose light and colours are reminiscent of the atmosphere of a Western the men at work are filmed in a suspended time frame struggling with their economic needs and their dreams for a better future. Their harsh daily routine filmed with a certain thoughtfulness subtly reveals what makes it possible: moments of complicity. With wonderful sequences and an original narrative structure - fragments of magic appear through the editing (of images and sound) - All That Passes by Through a Window That Doesn't Open seizes the history and the present of a world crossroads.
