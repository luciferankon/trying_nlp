After the announcement of the servant Losat the nobleman Kurt Menliff returns to the castle of his family at the seaside to congratulate his brother Christian Menliff for his marriage with his former lover Nevenka. Kurt feels the hatred and the fear of his father Count Menliff and the servant Giorgia who blames him for seducing and killing her daughter and indifference from his cousin Katia. On the next afternoon the sadistic Kurt meets Nevenka riding a horse alone on the beach and whips the masochistic woman and makes love with her. Late night Nevenka is missing and everybody is seeking her while Kurt is stabbed in the neck with the same dagger that Giorgia's daughter was murdered. On the next days the members of the family suspects of each other while Nevenka is haunted by the ghost of Kurt. Kurt Menliff is a ruthless and sadistic 19th Century nobleman who returns to his seafront castle home after years of wondering. He finds himself immediately at odds with his invalid father a Count as well as Kurt's spineless younger brother Christian whom is married to Kurt's cousin and former lover Nevenka. When Kurt is found in his room on the next night murdered suspicion falls on everyone which gets more complicated when Nevenka begins seeing his ghost (real or imaginary?) haunting the castle supposedly wanting revenge against his killers.
