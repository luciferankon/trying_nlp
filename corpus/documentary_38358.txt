Every Boy Wants A Toy Gun is a creative immersive action-driven documentary about two young men in contemporary northern England. Both of their identities defined by war but for very different reasons. With a hybrid style that boldly mixes highly cinematic reenactments with observational elements and interviews the film explores themes of masculinity and heroism fantasy versus reality and reveals what drives modern manhood.
