Willy and Jonny drive the time to make the ladies' world happy in the village of Bumskirchen. Local men have little understanding of these activities so they are forced to take a break. They go to the city where they continue to devote themselves to their favorite job: Jonny becomes the target object of starving ladies because of his perseverance while Willy is running a lady's chapel and performs his performances half-naked.
