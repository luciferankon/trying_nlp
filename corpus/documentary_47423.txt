Although massively underfunded and working with long since outdated equipment the dedicated employees of the Krymmtrolleybus department have managed to keep their buses running on schedule and safe. Many spare parts needed for repairs have to be made from scratch. Much of the equipment has to be meticulously maintained far beyond its designated retirement age by people well beyond theirs. In early 2000 the Krymmtrolleybus with the help of a popular uprising barely survived a dubious attempt by the Ukrainian government to bankrupt the company and transfer all business to a private fleet of minibuses. In 2014 as the fleet of electrified buses was slowly being upgraded the Russian Federation decided to annex Crimea. An uncertain future lay ahead once again.
