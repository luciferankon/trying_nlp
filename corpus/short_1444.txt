Letters to Palestine is a documentary project that gathers the voices of Arab people to read their letters-never-sent to the Palestinian people living under occupation. Young and old these correspondents are given a unique chance to send Palestinians their love and their stories. In October of 2010 the first cut of the film was screened in Lyd El Khalil (Hebron) and Naasrah (Nazareth) to the members of the community and copies were given to the attendees to screen in their own communities.
