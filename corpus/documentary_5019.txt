In April and May 2008 the alpinist Mario Vielmo reaches Nepal for a new adventure: climbing Mount Everest without oxygen. But this time the expedition seems to be anomalous from the beginning: at the same time the torch of the Beijing Olimpic Games 2008 is supposed to ascend the Mountain from the opposite side. This macro-operation will cause several and unexpected inconveniences to all the climbers at the base-camp. Himalayan Blackout is the concrete evidence that the alpinism can go over the individualistic limits of a simple sport challenge: the few lucky people who are able to climb this kind of mountain have also the responsibility to give voice to the speechless ones asking for a little justice from the top of the world.
