Although Brigham Young continually preached peace men women and children on both sides of the conflict were subject to raids treachery betrayal kidnapping and murder. Led by Chief Blackhawk the natives were successful in stopping white expansion as scores of Mormons evacuated their settlements and relocated to larger communities and newly erected forts. Told by the descendants of those involved in 'Utah's Blackhawk War' this documentary focuses on the cultural economic and political affairs which existed in Utah during the 1860s.
