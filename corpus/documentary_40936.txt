'The Memory of the Hands' is a hybrid documentary film concerning the revision of teaching methodologies developed by Celestin Freinet and tested by a number of teachers in public schools in the Region of Murcia on the 1970s and 80s. The research arises from the university classroom and involves a review of the evidence which created a different way to teach in order to assess its validity in the current school.
