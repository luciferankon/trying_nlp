Chekka Bommalata is a wooden string puppetry tradition from the state of Telangana in India. With only two troupes and its artists into their 60's the folk art form is on the brink of extinction. This film follows one of the troupes and tries to explore their hope in keeping it alive. From 1974-1994 called as the Black Period for folk art forms in India Chekka Bommalata lost its presence and was declared almost extinct. However in through a workshop for children and a public performance in 2001 Mothe Jagannadam's troupe got support of committed scholars artists patrons and journalists helping it show a direction. Since then they gradually got wider visibility and recognition across India through performances at various platforms. Today the average age of these puppeteers is 60. With the younger generation not taking interest in the practice of the art form due to various socio-economic reasons Chekka Bommalata is again at the brink of extinction. Tracing these ups and downs following Mothe Jagannadam's troupe in Ammapuram the film tries to explore the hope in the artists who despite all odds seem to be fighting the battle to keep it alive - at least by choosing to perform until they die.
