Officially this series is a 12 episodes (15'00" each) Open University Course -but in hilarious disguise. It is meant to give tips and information on environmental friendly housekeeping. So the two main characters the next-door neighbors Hoeksteen (Cornerstone) and Groenstrook (Greenbelt) left behind by their families in their cartoon-like homes try to keep house for a few weeks. Hoeksteen as a specimen of a environmental 'un'concious consumerist couch potato Groenstrook as his patronizing pedant who knows all but succeeds in exploding a bio-gas-valve running away a dishwasher and much more. All this under scrutiny of an ever-alarmed officer of the eco-law.
