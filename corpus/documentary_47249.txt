In 1880 at the end of his life Edouard Manet the painter of 'Olympia' and 'The Luncheon on the Grass' is still both famous (for the scandals he created) and misunderstood. Things change at last when the Galerie de la Vie Moderne gives him the opportunity to show an overview of his whole career thus allowing visitors to appraise his production in terms of artistic value not basing themselves on hearsay.
