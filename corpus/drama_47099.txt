Around midnight at the orphanage..In the corridors of the housein the darkest night up comes a man.Who is this man? For the headmasterit's the second coming!The messiah. He'd always told him he would come back some day.He was the pride of the orphanage a former pupil who became a celebrated lawyer.There's in the house a place dedicated to himwith his picturesflowersdecorations...It looks like an oratory. But the hero is not the one you think he is;the Police are hot on his heelsand he is looking for a refuge. For the headmasterit would be terrible unthinkable to tell his pupils the man they admire is a criminal.
