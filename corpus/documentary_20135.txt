The Programme focuses on children from all over Bangladesh who have come to Jessore to await cleft palate surgery. For many this will mean the freedom to go to school speak fluidly and escape the brutality meted out to those considered cursed. In Bangladesh it is widely believed that cleft palate is caused by expectant mothers gutting fish during a lunar eclipse. This observational documentary follows several children as they face the challenges of a third world surgery.
