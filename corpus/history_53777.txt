Great Lady in Dirty Oil Town Builds Theatre Palace for College Kids. That's a headline Gertrude Krampert would have loved. Gertrude Krampert was a colorful worldly woman whose love of theatre was wholly unmatched in central Wyoming. The Gertie at 30 commemorates the Gertrude Krampert Center for Theatre and Dance at Casper College. The "Gertie" turns 30 this fall. The story behind the theatre's origin and its rise to prominence as the elegant regional home of top-quality entertainment is a compelling tale. The documentary blends a rich variety of local lore and legend with past voices and historical perspectives to honor the grand and generous lady who bought a theatre and thus elevated Casper College Theatre and Dance to impact the national stage. This unique glimpse into Casper history will deepen your appreciation for "Gertie" and for the many students who have proudly called Mrs. Krampert's glorious playhouse "home".
