It is dawn. Biagio Propane lives in San Lorenzo where he organizes poetry readings in his brother's pub. He teaches foreign languages and literature at a high school but is also a poet who writes books for "the unfortunate and flawed." Salvatore Sansone lives in Testaccio where he lounges and writes poems. Biagio and Salvatore have not seen each other in over ten years. They meet by chance one morning at the Protestant Cemetery. Both went there to see the tomb of Gregory Corso a poet who spent the last years of his life in Rome reciting poems. As the two converse about poetry they wonder if there will be a repeat event like Castelporziano where in 1979 poets from around the world gathered in a large Woodstock of poetry. So they decide to try to organize a Great Reading putting together the largest possible number of poets living in the capital.
