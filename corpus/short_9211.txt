An incident from the early days of Québec's quiet revolution tailor-made for the cartoonist. It is the story of a Montréal commuter train a unilingual ticket collector and a bilingual passenger. The passenger appears on screen himself to describe his bid to have tickets requested in French as well as in English. What ensued and how even the railway president became involved is illustrated with wit and humor.
