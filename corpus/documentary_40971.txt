India raised its Border Security Force some 50 years ago after a war with its neighbours Pakistan. Since then these Bordermen are trained specifically to guard these borders under the harshest of conditions. They are trained to deal with civilians during peacetime and during war hold the enemy till the army arrives. These men and women perform their duties day in and day out living far from their families bonding with each other and with hopes to see their family soon.
