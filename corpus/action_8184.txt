In 2005 incursions along the Mexico/Arizona border have risen to an all time high. Not just illegal immigration the Mexican drug cartels have stepped up their drug running and female sex-slave trafficking activities. One evening on a routine operation across the border the cartel has a flat tire on a ranch near Bisbee Arizona encounters the ranch owner and murders him as he inquires about their presence on his land. The Governor of Arizona then screams for the presence of US Army troops on the border. The President details the Pentagon to send a team to investigate the murder. Colonel Edward Justice and his crack team of Rangers are assigned the mission. The Cartel notices the presence of regular Army troops and cooks up a plan to kidnap the young Hispanic female member of the team for not only intel but to sell her into their profitable sex slave trade. Colonel Justice and the team then plan and execute an unapproved covert rescue mission across the border.
