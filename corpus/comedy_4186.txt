Wonderville is all about working in a theme restaurant with a handful of crazy characters trying to do their job without killing each other in the process. They range from a burnt out haggard manager a professionally trained actor too good to be there to a spoiled bitchy princess type sweet on the outside but rotten on the inside and a very sensitive cry baby that wears her heart and emotions on her sleeve.. Let the good times roll!
