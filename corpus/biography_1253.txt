On Blank Canvas we meet extraordinary artists and share in their stories of passion and dedication. What drove them to their art? How did it feel the first time they picked up that brush and filled up a blank canvas? Sometimes it is a form of personal expression and other times it is a way to preserve one's heritage. A few rare artists even use their art forms to build bridges and foster dialogue bringing people together. We also delve into the life of the artist his fears and passions and ultimately how he uses his art form to make sense of the world and strengthen his connection to the divine.
