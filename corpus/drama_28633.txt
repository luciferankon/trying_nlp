Already on edge Cody develops a series of unhealthy obsessions that gradually cause his life to spiral out of control. While fixated on his ex-partner Cody channels his obsession to a new love interest the former tenant of his new apartment. Yet an even darker obsession begins to develop---a morbid fascination with the assassinations of two American icons-- President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert Kennedy. The Lonely explores addiction and loneliness through the eyes of a millennial-a millennial whose experiences are captured in a postmodern re-imagining of the American Dream. It is the story of a generation struggling to reconcile the promise of the 'Dream' with a reality of economic downturns perpetual violence and unfulfilling relationships.
