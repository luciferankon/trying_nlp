Siesta is a sweet girl that has a weird condition: she suffers from narcolepsy. Suddenly she falls asleep. But this is not so bad because she can choose what to dream. Her dreams become a crazy and very funny adaptation of the Classics. From the Ancient Greeks to Shakespeare from the adventures of Jack London to the mysterious worlds of Kafka or Poe. The Classics have never been so awesome.
