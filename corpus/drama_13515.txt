An accident entwines the lives of two complete strangers. When Po-Hai ('Kunda Hsieh' (qv)) is involved in an accident he is so worried about the girlfriend that he will leave behind that he grabs a random stranger Ho Pu-Fan ('George Hu (I)' (qv)) and asks him to tell his girlfriend that he is breaking up with her. When Pu-Fan passes on the message of the dying man to the girlfriend Hsu Man-Man ('Phoebe Yuan' (qv)) he sees how upset she is about being dumped and does something on a whim.
