Award winning filmmaker Karen Everett gives us a no-holds-barred look at her sexually charged love life by revealing every juicy detail. While examining the human ability to redefine ourselves and reshape what we think "love" means Everett masterfully weaves images of lesbians making their way through present-day sex clubs and attending masturbation seminars. Drawing on her own experience and that of her circle of lesbian bisexual and polyamorous friends and lovers Everett blends her own personal trials with intimate raw and emotional moments of sexual pleasure and heart-wrenching loneliness.
