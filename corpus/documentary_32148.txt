Bryan Singer and Guy Shalem in collaboration with Same Name Productions are developing a documentary exploring the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through the vantage point of a dynamic Arab-Israeli activist. The movie which has the working title "In the Middle of the Middle East" will follow a young man as he navigates personal and political minefields determined to advance a workable solution for coexistence in the Middle East while searching for true peace within himself.
