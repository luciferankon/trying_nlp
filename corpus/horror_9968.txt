While waiting for their bus five passengers have just had horrible nightmares and decide to tell them to each other to help killing time. A swimmer who has lessons in a swimming pool with a dead swimmer tells the first one. A young boy who goes camping with two friends and a crazy man as a leader is the next. Then a lonely woman who has an infatuation with the anchor of a late night show and finds that he is indeed a vampire. A young man who finds he has the gift of bringing dead people back to life brings a cold blood criminal back to life. Last a skeptic professor of anthropology tells to his students about an evil Spanish creature from the Middle Ages called "Ixpe" and a young woman embodies it. When the bus arrives they have a huge surprise.
