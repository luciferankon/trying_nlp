Typical Amos 'n Andy storyline has the boys trying to make a go of their "open-air" taxi business while they get caught up in a society hassle involving driving musicians to a fancy party. All the regular characters are here (or mentioned) including the famous Mystic Knights of the Sea. The only film appearance of radio's long-running characters.
