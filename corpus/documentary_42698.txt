The film combines the testimony of four women who went through rape or incest and the myths of rape from Metamorphoses and attempts to locate the forgotten flickering voice. To tell the story from the inside to allow a place for a narrative which is difficult to hear that deviates from the aesthetic and illuminates the sordid outlines of our culture.
