Her mother always raised Beth to be a 'good girl' but never really specified how to be good. One evening her mother decides Beth cannot go to a party even though she had promised Beth she could go. Beth sneaks out of the house anyway and spends some time with a boy she is in love with. A biology teacher decides that if parents don't tell their children the dangers of the human body he should do it in order to prevent more accidents from happening. Beth suddenly starts to cry and runs out of the classroom. When her mother hears about this she thinks that Beth was shocked of having to hear those things and she together with some of her friends ask the school to do something about this degenerate teacher. But that was not the reason why Beth was so upset.
