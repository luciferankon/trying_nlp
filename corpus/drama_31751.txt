As he interacts more with the public he learns that he has options in life that he had not originally conceived. He meets Rachel (Lauren Chase) an ex CIA agent's daughter and Samson (Cal Simmons) a fellow mercenary on a journey that subconsciously gives him the direction to change his life for better or worse .
