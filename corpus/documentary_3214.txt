The world's most renowned surfing cinematographer Jack McCoy spends two years following two of the world's greatest surfers: Andy Irons a highly competetive and driven surfer set on beating Kelly Slater and winning the world title and Dave "Rasta" Rastovich a free surfer who is more about the soul of surfing. The result: Blue Horizon a documentary made to bring surf movies back to the big screen where "they truly belong".
