Compiling over 7 years and 1000 hours of filming and footage respectively the vérité-style documentary Land of Opportunity captures the early years of post-catastrophe New Orleans through the eyes of those most affected by its devastation. From the urban planner to the immigrant worker the pragmatist to the activist our protagonists represent the rich diversity of lives and stories that call New Orleans home. Through their eyes we experience the personal and emotional impact of an unprecedented urban reconstruction process. The people in the film are examples of urban paradox: marginalized multi-racial moneyed or not and often contradictory. Their stories echo a universally applicable paradigm: that of ordinary people in cities and towns across the world grappling with extraordinary circumstances much larger than themselves.
