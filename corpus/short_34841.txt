This dance film short takes place in Western NY in an old manor house situated on a cliff overlooking Lake Erie.  The dancer Helen French portrays two characters or rather two aspects of the same woman.  Indoors we observe her isolated inside a starkly furnished room.  She is trapped inside the walls inside her mind possibly by old memories and habits or society.  She looks out the window and visualizes the freedom and endless possibilities that the outdoors have to offer.  Does she follow her vision of freedom?  Or does she remain confined behind closed doors?
