Ellie and Tess are young struggling actresses and feminists who regularly struggle with challenges as women in the film industry. From the pay gap to nudity in film to body shaming to a string of female characters who are defined by their relationship to men. They regularly have to choose between accepting roles that misrepresent women or not working at all. After a day of particularly trying auditions Ellie and Tess decide to write and produce their own film: a multi-genre movie that takes the stereotypes that each gender faces in the the industry and flips them on their head. "REPRESENT" follows Ellie and Tess as the recruit a cast and crew on a shoestring budget juggle day jobs tackle misogyny overcome limitations try to teach male actors about the finer points of the feminist content and do their best to make a difference no matter how small.
