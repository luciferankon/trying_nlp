With a large number of factories in the area the hosiery industry forms the backbone and economic mainstay of a small rural town. One in two of the population makes their living from the production of socks. "Brother Black Dog" is of one of them and has been toiling day and night. However one day in spring his overseas orders suddenly disappear. He gets stuck in a midlife crisis. For decades workers just like Brother Black Dog have depended on the manufacture of socks to raise their families and realize their dreams. But a great economic crisis like a Tsunami is hitting this small town. People in the small town are worried that they won't be able to survive amid global competitions in a year of worldwide depression. In spite of all the bad news Brother Black Dog remains hopeful inspired by his good old days. Years before his dreams of becoming a volleyball player were crushed by a car accident. With persistent injuries he knows how important good socks are to athletes. Now he dreams of creating socks to protect people's feet and works on designs for his own brand aiming to reverse his fate of simply manufacturing subcontract OEM orders. How will he survive the crisis? Can he realize his dream during his middle age? It is a real story of struggling about a man who will never give up.
