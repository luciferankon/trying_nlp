Marc and Biana have three weeks to train a staff of former bank robbers thieves and minor offenders. They also have to completely outfit a brand new business and create an Italian menu around fresh and seasonal ingredients. But the real challenge will be making it beyond opening night-because once the eatery opens the restaurant's motley crew have only three months to turn a profit-or their bosses will pull the plug and they'll lose their second (or last?) chance to turn their lives around. Can these convicted criminals handle culinary boot camp? Are they ready for the stresses of a professional kitchen-and can they cook themselves up a bright new future on the right side of the law?
