Chick Brian overeager cub reporter is stranded during a storm with his girlfriend Mary at the remote Lame Dog Inn. As Mary says 'What a creepy place!' Soon they're alone in the house with the victims of a double murder...and Chick has the silly idea of incriminating himself (hiding evidence of his innocence for later) to gain journalistic fame. Things go wrong and the electric chair looms... Charlie Brian - Chick to his friends - is an overly eager junior investigative reporter with the New York Star newspaper. His eagerness is in part so that he can make enough money to marry his girlfriend Mary Agnew. The success and money are more to placate Mary's father Police Inspector William Agnew who doesn't approve of Chick as a match for his daughter. As such Chick and Mary have to see each other on the sly without her father knowing. Chick's career takes a backward slide when he bungles a big story on which he is working concerning a diamond smuggling ring. Out later that evening Chick and Mary take temporary refuge at the Lame Dog Inn an isolated and creepy roadhouse while they wait out a rainstorm. They stumble across two murders in progress of the only two other people associated with the roadhouse the porter Charles Spengler and the only guest Emil Brugger. They came face to face with the male and female culprits who manage to escape. Despite Mary's objection Chick senses an opportunity to use the murders as his big professional break manipulating the story to make it more sensationalistic and as a "Chick Brian" exclusive to the paper but with a twist that could be dangerous for Chick if anything were not to go according to plan. What Chick does not take into account is that the murderers ultimately are able to identify both him and Mary from his newspaper articles on the case the murderers who will do whatever required to protect their identities as the true culprits.
