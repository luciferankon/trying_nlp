When gun-wielding guerillas skyjack a Los Angeles airliner the government calls in the one man who can get the job done. He's the Scorpion - a hardcore intelligence agent and the prime target of every country's hit list. The Scorpion defuses the skyjacking but steps into an international scheme involving the assassination of a Faued an imprisoned kingpin turned informant. When the Scorpion's lifelong friend and partner is killed he unleashes his ultimate sting - avenging his buddy's death and finding Faued's killers before they find him.
