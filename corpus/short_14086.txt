A frustrated hotel receptionist forced to acquiesce to the constant demands of customers Stewart Weavemeyer holds auditions for a non-existent film to invert the power dynamic he experiences daily. Through the imposturous auditions Stewart catapults himself to positions of control and power that satisfy his ego and validate his self-worth. He selects actors from piles of submitted headshots conducts interviews and directs complete strangers in whatever manner and scenario he chooses. But this curious form of distraction has turned into an insatiable dependency for control. Stewart suddenly finds himself submerged in a passive and escapist lifestyle that has lost all sense of direction. Audition looks to see if Stewart can recognize his own state of delusion and confront the reality of his discontented life.
