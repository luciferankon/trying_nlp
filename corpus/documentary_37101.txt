Creative Dimensions is a documentary film created by two souls trying to see perspectives of life creativity and human abilities. Where lays the intrinsic value of our thought process that always works to better our lives? Is it called creativity? Or what is creativity? As vague and as easy as as difficult it appears to answer these questions we can almost believe that life itself is a creative process.
