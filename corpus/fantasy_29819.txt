In the year 2018 a story unfolds of a man who is down and out and lost in the underbelly of urban London. As he is bullied by a rich passer by all is not what it seems as he foretells the mans imminent future which ends in his accidental death as he leaves. A young boy who holds his nerve in the unsettling crowd reaches out to this modern day tramp and takes him to a psychic who starts to realise the man is a spiritual person perhaps the most spiritual man on Earth. The psychic reveals the man's history through a tarot card reading and begins with his birth in a squat where he is visited by 3 pearly kings and starts to see a remarkable resemblance to the most famous and oldest story in the world. Is this the 2nd coming a day of revelation or just a normal day in Londinium.
