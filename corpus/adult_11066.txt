At the NYS penitentiary known as "The Playpen" the gals behind bars are used to getting their way. That is until Warden Fishbone is replaced by tyrannical Warden Kahn. With their fun formally shut down the gals must use some friendly persuasion to get Kahn to see their way - a task that's harder than it seems. Meanwhile a conniving con-girl creates the perfect stud in her cell - except for one small problem.
