The Countess Gone Wild-Less is a new reality-follow series centered on former first lady of Nice and the French Riviera Countess Ilene Graham Medecin. The Countess was a contemporary of Princess Grace of Monaco. She is also the great great niece of gangster Jake the Barber and Max Factor. The Countess grew up in Beverly Hills and was married twice before the age of 26. Her life dramatically changed when she met Count Jacques Medecin the Mayor of Nice and the President of the Province of Cote D' Azure; after a two year affair they married but not without controversy. The Countess then became the American Jewel of the French Riviera. The show will follow the Countess as she tries to jump-start her life especially after living for nearly two-decades in obscurity due to her own arrest while she was visiting Paris in 1997.
