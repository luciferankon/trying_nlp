Brownfinger is an action packed movie with scenes and sounds that will make your heart skip a beat. The masterful directing by Marcus Gunnebo Ardalan Adlund and Jonathan Gustafsson will take you on a nerve edging claustrophobic and self exploring ride through time and space and it will with no doubt leave you stunned and amazed. It is swift witty challenging yet clever in its way to keep you on your toes through out the entire elapse of the film. The movie of the century!
