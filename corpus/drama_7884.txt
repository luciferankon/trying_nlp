What You Will is a tragi-comedy drama shot as if it is a fly-on-the-wall documentary. Co-produced with the Royal Shakespeare Company Filter Theatre's extraordinary production of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night is featured live in this backstage road movie. Interviews with Romola Garai and Dominic West are deviously mixed with behind-the-scenes filming where the actors' off-stage shenanigans reflect their onstage characters and the real and unreal meld into inglorious technicolor.
