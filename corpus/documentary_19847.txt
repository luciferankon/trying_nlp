June 2003. During the final month of their year-long stay in Fiji indie-film gurus John and Janet Pierson and their two children host a documentary film crew. John's been showing free movies at the 288-seat 180 Meridian Cinema in remote Natokalan Village on the island of Taveuni. Reality intrudes in paradise: their home is burgled the local Catholic priest criticizes John's project their daughter's behavior may be threatening the reputation of her friend and John's prickly personality follows him. Against this backdrop the Fijians laugh at the Three Stooges Buster Keaton and "Jackass: The Movie." John finishes the year with ten movies in ten days: do movies matter?
