A unique film portrait of the famous Italian pianist. Maurizio Pollini felt himself that the time had come to submit to the probing of the camera an exercise made all the more necessary because of his usual avoidance of the public eye. In "Man and Master" he discusses a richly complex range of topics with lively wit and intelligence. In addition to some biographical details the film covers his musical experience from the Chopin Piano Competition to avant-garde music; the people whose paths he has crossed including Abbado BÃ¶hm Kleiber and Boulez; his repertoire (from Bach to Verdi Schoenberg Boulez and Luigi Nono); and his political commitment in Italy during the "Years of Lead" and more.
