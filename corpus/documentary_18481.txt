Set in Brown University Castle on High tells the story of three undergrads duking it out for the student body presidency! Zac knows the Undergraduate Council of Students' constitution by heart. John has a hard time thinking of anything he's really done in two years on UCS. And Arthur has never been to a meeting - he's too busy playing with his band! The three candidates cheered on by a crazy crew of characters fight for the hearts and minds of a student body that just doesn't care. In the race to the top anything is fair game!
