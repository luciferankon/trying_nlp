Twelve-year old Maggie likes to build miniature houses out of trash. It's easy for her to find trash because she lives on the streets alone. Middle-aged Margaret tries to deaden the pain in the big house where she lives alone. There is a door that waits to be opened. No matter where you are there is always a door. It's not an escape; it's an invitation.
