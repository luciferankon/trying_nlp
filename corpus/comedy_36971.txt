In this series the French Canadian clown Mark Favreau teaches common words and phrases that are used in the French language. To show how these elements of French are used in conversation Favreau stars in comedy sketches as Sol the Tramp; a clown who has an uncanny knack of innocently causing havoc with every encounter he has with people.
