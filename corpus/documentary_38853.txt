Aged 34 Wilco and Anja Drew decided to take a year out to travel the world. For Wilco it meant turning his back on his own successful telecoms firm. For Anja taking unpaid leave from her financial management position. Despite the risks the plan was simple - pack a rucksack head off for new adventures and enjoy some precious months by themselves. Or so they thought. The plans did not change but the cast became a little larger. Two weeks after they adopted twin baby boys they found out Anja was pregnant. Despite suddenly being a family of five they were determined not to miss out on the fun. Ollie Max and Freddie were all just about a year old when they set off.
