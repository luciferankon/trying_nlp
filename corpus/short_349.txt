Jim is a notoriously anti-social suburban teenager. When he ventures out on a lone walk down to a local creek Jim drops his watch in the filth-ridden water. After arachnophobia prevents him from retrieving his watch Jim finds himself reluctantly and awkwardly interacting with another person to get it back. At home Jim prepares for a couple hours alone with his parents out of the house- closing the window shades and heating up some microwaveable soup. After some mysterious phone calls from seemingly malicious strangers Jim has a fear-induced panic attack and begins to drift away from reality. When Jim lets loose his fear he severs all connection with the outside world and secures his own unfortunate fate.
