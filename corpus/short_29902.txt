The old fellow whose wife is insanely jealous of him never misses an opportunity to force his attentions upon the girl although she will have none of him and manages to keep the old pest at a safe distance. One day however the young fellow becomes suspicious that there is more than an ordinary amount of affection existing between his lady love and her employer for while visiting her he is shocked when the old fellow steals away from his wife and comes to pay a little visit to the maid. The youth steals out of the room and hastens to inform the lady of the house of her husband's unbecoming conduct. The lady is loath to believe that her husband is unfaithful to her but upon coming up to the room he finds him on his knees pouring forth words of love to the much-amused maiden. The wife feeling that the girl is to blame attacks her while the two men make a hasty exit leaving the women to settle their little affair undisturbed.
