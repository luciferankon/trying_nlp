San Diego California has the largest concentration of military might in the Western hemisphere. Thousands of marines and sailors call San Diego home while on their tours of duty. Working as a drill instructor Sgt. Glenn Swann has many experiences with marines; while off duty has more than his share of contact with sailors. In his "Private Files" Swann relates a few of his fantasies such as a one on one instruction with his hot aid and attendant Scott R & R with his friend Rick and his partner and a thorough workout with his buddy Troy. It all ends in a climatic scene with a barracks full of hot Marines.
