Murdo is an accordion player but has not played since his mother passed. He meets an old lady called Queen Monzee-ay who plays accordion. She rekindles his interest in music and invites him play a gig with her. The music becomes a wedge which drives itself between him and his father who out of the best intentions tries to control him. Eventually Murdo transcends his father and follows the music.
