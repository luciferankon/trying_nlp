Code Kids is a documentary that follows four successful tech leaders and entrepreneurs as they influence change on a policy level and on the front lines with teachers and students. This is a film that will document the beginnings of a cultural educational and technological revolution that is only just starting in Atlantic Canada. David Alston Gavin Uhma Nicole Leblanc and Jevon MacDonald are four leaders in the Atlantic Canadian tech sector. All four are investing their time heavily back into the community and the region. They also share a vision to see every child in Atlantic Canada learn code to prepare them for a fast paced and excited future. David Nicole Gavin and Jevon each have contributed to this vision in unique ways. This documentary will follow each of the four as they work with schools politicians parents and industry leaders to help see this vision become reality over the winter and Spring semester of 2014. If there is buy in from leadership and from the residents of the region their efforts will be considered a success. This is a model that is inspired by countries like Finland and Estonia who have successfully rebuilt their economy and education systems by integrating coding into all aspects of learning. In a region that loses thousands of young people every year to the West the stakes are high. If the kids are not being prepared with the tools necessary to succeed careers in the knowledge sectors then there is a very good chance that we will lose more of them as they move to other regions that have other career opportunities. This film will also follow the stories of the students that the four leaders are mentoring. As it turns out each of the mentors are helping students from four levels of education.
