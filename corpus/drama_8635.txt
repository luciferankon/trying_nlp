413 Hope Street is the physical address of a crisis center catering to inner city youth and their families. The doctors surgeons psychologists and social workers work together to provide the best possible support to anyone walking in their door. The show is a drama ranging in issues from a girl getting gonorrhea who had an affair with her father; to a kid who repeatedly witnessed his cop-father abuse his mother; to characters living up to the responsibility of caring for their infant children.
