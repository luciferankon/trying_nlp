In each programme a celebrity who is passionate about cooking gets a chance to become head chef in a real restaurant with real staff and real diners. The chef devises their own menu and selects their own wine list. A table of three critics comments on what the chef produces and ultimately gives them a star rating. The highest accolade is five stars.
