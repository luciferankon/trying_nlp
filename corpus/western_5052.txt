Ranchers on the California/Nevada border are harrassed beyond endurance by the combined efforts of Jack Slade (Ed Lynch) a rustler leader and Brand (Charles King) who runs a "Protective Association." Rancher Ringold (William Walling) goes to the capitol for help which soon arrives in the form of Dan Wright (Robert Frazer) and his pal Jack-Knife (Lane Chandler) posing as drifters.
