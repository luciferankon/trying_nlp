Twin brothers were separated at birth. One was good the other evil. They have to fight each other at the turn of the millenia to determine which side will rule. The good one is often visited by his last incarnation a knight who lived around the year 1000 and killed his brother in a similar ceremony. Other people from that same time resurface including a monk that is now a priest and the lover of the knight who becomes the hero's lover.
