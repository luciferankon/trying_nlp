A man walks the streets intent reading a book. On his path he is going to meet different strangers: a man and a woman a mendicant two girls who are in love a bartender and a black guy. The book is a collection of Shakespeare's tragedies and comedies and the people the man is meeting are reminding him of the characters described by the English playwright.
