A glimpse of a man. A prodigious talent born from the ashes of the promise of the greatest country in the world. Humble beginnings to the biggest sports star in the world. What happens to a poor kid that's exploited and trained to attack for profit. Then the shell that's left and the emergence of the human being and his struggle to retrace it back and start again. Change it and make it fresh. Redemption for the irredeemable.
