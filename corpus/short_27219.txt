The only person Daniel has ever really trusted is his older brother Sam. From the time they were small children they have always looked out for each other and now they are in their early 20s little has changed. Despite Sam's impulsive nature and little forethought for the consequences his actions may have Daniel has always believed that Sam has his best interests at heart and therefore been willing to help him out. However when Sam drags Daniel into a particularly life- altering situation the brothers have to make a decision whether they hand themselves in to the police or run away. The brothers conflicting views on what to do leads to decisions about whether they can stick together through this like they always have or if they'll finally have to go their separate ways. The issue is complicated further when Sam's increasingly selfish nature starts to come out making Daniel question whether Sam really is doing what he thinks is best for them both and if he is willing to continue to blindly follow his brother in and out of various situations or if he should start to stand up for himself and make his own choices. These decisions force them to seek advice from someone from their past their estranged father someone that they'd rather leave behind. This is a difficult visit for the brothers and they hope their father will be able to point them in the right direction but his personal agenda and shady activities get in the way once again leaving Sam and Daniel with no clearer answers than they had before and all the more desperate to make their final decisions.
