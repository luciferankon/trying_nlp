Minsu is a film-major university student who has failed to show his talent so far. For a student director like himself it is hard to make a short film about dating violence without any respect from the crew. He became frustrated when editing his film at his place and at that moment he heard a woman screaming in front of his place. Without any hesitation he takes out a mini shotgun mic.
