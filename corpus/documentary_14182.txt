In 2003 documentarian 'James Miller (V)' (qv) began filming Palestinian children but was killed by an Israeli soldier before he could finish the project. Assembled from footage shot before his death this film follows three children in the Gaza Strip city of Rafah. Twelve-year-old friends Ahmed and Mohammed many of whose friends have been killed by Israeli forces dream about martyrdom while 16-year-old Najla has also lost many of her relatives. All three talk about their lives and hatred of Israel.
