In the skies.. A plane is a small homeland.. The trip is history.. And the passengers are the people.. with all what is going on the ground and It's communal religious political and tribal courses ..Within a succession of love.. Parting.. Jealousy ..Dispute and Differing.. The plane falls.. And falls the Disputes.. We live when we coexist.
