They hold a "travel permit" instead of an identity card; they are free poignant and brotherly. They are the "Brothers of the Wind" as filmed by Bruno Le Jean in a music documentary: Angelo Debarre Ninine Garcia Tchavolo Schmitt and Moreno. Django-style swing permanently caresses their guitars. It is not so much the concerts that Bruno Le Jean has captured but rather the soul of his heroes. He does so using images and a sense of composition and movement that has everything: emotion humour and poetry. Crafted with tact and sensitivity by a "gadjo" who truly understands gypsy culture Les Fils du vent is an indisputable success.
