A game where two contestants vie for the chance at guessing a certain object well hidden inside a larger white on black negative line drawing. True or false questions are first asked in rapid succession and the contestant that guesses enough right answers gets a chance at "seeing" the object and pointing out where it's hidden with a pointer. As each succeeding effort fails part of the puzzle is removed until it becomes more and more obvious where the camouflaged item is.
