Seeing the Forest chronicles the history of the Siuslaw National Forest over the last quarter century. 25 years ago when the controversy over clearcutting the old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest was at its peak the Siuslaw was at the epicenter of the conflict between timber interests and environmentalists with the Forest Service caught in between. Today the Siuslaw has become the exemplar of sustainable forest management. They are restoring the ecosystem including the once historic runs of Pacific salmon. The environmental and timber communities are working together with the Forest Service to accomplish this goal and creating jobs for local workers at the same time. Seeing the Forest tells the story of why and how this remarkable turnaround in the fate of a public forest took place.
