Due to his morbid obesity the Houston teenager suffered from a range of serious medical problems that threatened to greatly reduce his lifespan including severe sleep apnea high blood pressure and a risk of diabetes. After trying numerous diets with no success Brandon decided to pursue having a gastric bypass operation to help him lose the excess weight.
