Cassie Gardner moves to a new town as a result of her parent's divorce. Cassie is funny sarcastic and clumsy though mostly she is just pessimistic refusing (unconsciously) to let anyone into her life. She quickly discovers Cole Phillips a caring boy in her grade who does not speak or associate with anyone. She decides to befriend him. Both are deemed outcasts though their problems are similar to those many teenagers face. Cole has been silent for four years shutting down completely only ever writing comments and ideas about the world on his wall. Cole's ideas and similar views on the world give Cassie hope which in turn gives Cole the hope he needs to get the courage to speak and change his future. Overall it is a story of hope truth and friendship.
