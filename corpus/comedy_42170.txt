Jula is a sultry lead singer searching the crowd for two things; a boyfriend with a "Greek-Roman Profile" and anybody with "full-on signing power". Micah is a wannabe in love with BMW's pink martinis the fairer sex and the dream of being the next single-name success story. Scott is a trust fund baby whose inner voice is constipated from the constant pressure of an over-bearing family business. And at the heart of this pandemonium is Rhonda the freak out of water trying to document it and follow her dreams in the face of all obstacles especially herself. These four artists are swimming in their desires to be understood accepted and loved...but drowning in the overwhelming pressures of selling out in the highly commercial world of LA. A world where they learn that dreams can drive you desire can destroy you but love can find you in A Couple of Days and Nights.
