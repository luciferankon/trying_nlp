The centennial flooding of Paris where the river Seine is expected to rise 8.62 meters above normal is expected to take place within the next five years. How will it happen? What will the most beautiful city in the world look like then? Imagine the Eiffel Tower the Louvre and L'Arc de Triopmhe deluged by dark icy waters. With the subway under water no electricity or telephone where can millions of citizens and twelve hospitals evacuate? THE GREAT FLOOD: PARIS 2010 is not a drama or disaster movie but a future archive documentary written in close collaboration with Paris' City Hall and Police Department as well as the main economic protagonists. The wealth of archive material on the 1910 and former centennial floods the precision of recent studies and the CGI technology's possible scenarios enable us to for the first time make a realistic and spectacular film of what will happen to the City of Lights when the Seine rises once more. Paris has been actively preparing for its centennial flood for many years and it remains to be seen the collective efforts have been in vain.
