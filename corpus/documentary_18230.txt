We traveled across the country to 10 major U.S. cities observing/interviewing Caucasian women without asking any personal information about themselves. Not even their names. We primarily focused on blonds brunettes and read heads with no in between hair color. What we found was quite shocking......Women with darker hair weren't just nicer than blonds as the stereotypes would say but much better human beings.
