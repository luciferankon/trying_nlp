'If you lose the toughest kids the school is no longer a school. It is a hospital that cares for the healthy and rejects the sick.' Don Lorenzo Milani. From this assumption comes a long research work that questions the role of public school in Italian society especially in difficult contexts such as those of the suburb. The outskirts of the big cities are places where using Pasolini's words 'there are lumps of alive imperfect disorderly and free humanity.' Exploring its microcosm means in a sense to describe the complexity of our present the direction that Italian society is taking. In fact in the 'class' universe there are already all the dynamics of our contemporaneity.
