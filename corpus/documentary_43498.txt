The filmmaker and his wife must adjust to the steep learning curve of being new parents the very little sleep and their old lives now gone forever; replaced by a crying eating machine who they have to learn how to love. The Turning Point is a funny heartwarming and honest film; edited in a very tight almost dream like fashion. It is a story that most people go through at least once in their lives but told in way and from a perspective that has not been seen before.
