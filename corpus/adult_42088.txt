A pretty young woman is at first appalled when she learns that her uncle is a white slavery racketeer - at least until she finds out how much money is involved then she joins the operation. Her first mission is initially a success - she grabs binds and gags two unattached women - but soon the tables are turned and she's the one about to be sold to ruthless overseas criminals. In the second tale three lovely ladies decide to throw a housewarming party for a friend but are quickly grabbed and tied up by a burglar.
