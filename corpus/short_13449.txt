This short film on the Roma community in Dublin focuses on the everyday life of three young Roma  Florin and Johannes of nineteen and Jennifer a young girl of fifteen. Stateless and without a home of their own they arrived in Ireland from Romania hoping to start a new life seeking asylum from the persecution suffered in their home countries because of racial harassment. The film structured as a visual poem reflects on the theme of immigration and racism and it's a song for all the migrant workers who are seeking a chance of a better life for all who lose that which they will never find for all who drink out of sadness for deportees for prisoners for the vanquished and for many more.
