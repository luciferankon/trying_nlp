Traveling from morning to night "Sandcastles" chronicles a day in the life of a construction worker named Getz. Getz wakes up alongside a highway. His wallet and cell-phone are missing. With no recollection of the previous night he returns home. On his answering machine he finds a message from himself...to himself: "I called you out of work today." For a laborer who's devoted his entire lonely life to his work and has for years worked seven-day weeks this is a first. And with his routine disrupted Getz can't help but puzzle over the riddle of his self-excused absence. All he knows is that it has something to do with Karina whom he met at a bookstore months earlier and Virgil whom he's never heard of but whose name now appears on his cell-phone's greeting.
