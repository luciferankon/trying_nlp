A female psychic (Sandra Ng) leaves her mainland home to visit Hong Kong. Along the way her bus crashes killing everyone on board except her (her powers protected her but they cause the dead passengers to re-aminate). So she seeks the help of a famous Tao Priest (Lam Ching-Ying) to put the dead back to rest.
