Mrs. Espig is deathly ill. Every breath is a struggle and every step exasperating. It seems as if time almost stands still in the respiratory clinic where she is quartered. her illness is a recurring compulsion a seemingly never ending irresistible impulse. An uncontrollable obsession and addiction. A mania. Nonetheless she can't kick. This is her struggle.
