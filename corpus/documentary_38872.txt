Christo and Jeanne-Claude met in Paris in 1958 and so began an extraordinary adventure in art a series of spectacular public art works in many parts of the world that reached its climax in February 2005 with the opening of "The Gates" in New York's Central Park after more than 20 years of negotiation and struggle. In this portrait the indefatigable duo reviews all their main projects since 1958 beginning with their small wrapped objects. Major emphasis is placed on their decades long effort to obtain permission for the "Wrapped Reichstag" project - a landmark event in the history of both art and politics.
