A heart-warming black & white silent film about a teenage boy who decides to play a board game with his grandfather (while at his house). During the game the boy's grandfather cheats and gets caught by the teen. But the teen (out of respect for his grandfather) lets him win and deals with the fact that his grandfather cheated. The film was written and directed by Michael J. Mantsourani Jr. who was inspired by his great-grandmother (for the story) and by the 2011 film The Artist (for it being a black & white silent film).
