FISHERMEN is a 5 minute 34 second long single channel projection. It shows fishermen in their boats heading out to sea. There is a strong wind and heavy waves. Despite numerous attempts the men fail. The waves capsize their boats and scatter their fishing equipment over the water - repeatedly. Filmed in West Africa. Fishermen is the first work in the series of five single channel video installations called Ã‰tudes. The works explore story elements in a short form and each have a special approach to moving image.
