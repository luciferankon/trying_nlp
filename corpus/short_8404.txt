Somewhere in the U.K. May and Jimmy are wannabe Bonnie and Clydes. They daydream of being criminals who die in a hail of gunfire. Jimmy tries to fence some stolen goods in order to buy heroin. May whines when he doesn't succeed. So Jimmy suggests they drive out to Kinney's - it's Kinney's birthday so he's sure to have some skag about. They are happy and in love as they drive through fields of grain toward Kinney's where one of Kinney's hangers-on has borrowed his pistol and is getting a shooting lesson from another slacker. By the time May and Jimmy arrive something terrible has happened and the fates of Bonnie and Clyde don't seem so romantic.
