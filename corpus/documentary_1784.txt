ZERO: An Investigation into 9/11 has one central thesis - that the official version of the events surrounding the attacks on 9/11 can not be true. This brand new feature documentary explores the latest scientific evidence and reveals dramatic new witness testimony which directly conflicts with the US Government's account. Featuring presentations from intellectual heavy weights; Gore Vidal and Nobel Prize winner Dario Fo the film challenges assumptions surrounding the attacks. In the words of the Italian daily newspaper Il Corriere de da Sera "What results is a sequence of contradictions gaps and omissions of stunning gravity." The importance of this film can not be overstated if its thesis is correct the justification for declaring the war on terror is built on a series of outrageous lies.
