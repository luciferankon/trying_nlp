Something has happened in the old far house (prison?) but no people says what: there were sliding doors strange words slaughters and an alone man confined in to a cellar... Director Ruffino and his troupe went into a haunted prison in Palermo now not more existing. They inspected all the building to find a natural location: when they went to the third floor they discovered a destroyed and "forgotten" area rich of wrecks and nearly walled up. They entered in and found three doors: the second was closed and they had to break it and when they where inside they find a very strange room with an upset bed (it seems somebody was nearly inside in!) a still full wash basin and other objects such as the room was still lived in.
