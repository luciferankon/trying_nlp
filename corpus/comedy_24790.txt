Half-witted longtime friends Albert (Luis Manzano) Isaac (Billy Crawford) Mozart "Mo" (DJ Durano) Michaelangelo "Mike" (Martin Escudero) and Aristotle "Aris" (Marvin Agustin) were used to living moronic yet pretty normal and hassle-free lives until successful career woman Becky Pamintuan (John Lapus) accused them of killing her father and ruin everything for them. The Moron 5 are more than sure of their innocence but for the life of them they can't find any single satisfactory argument on how to prove it especially when their opponent would do everything to punish them for whim. Spending three miserable years in prison trying different failed comedic attempts to get out they finally figured a way to escape. They stalked Becky and tried to understand why she's fighting so hard to have them imprisoned when it's clear as day that what happened three years ago was a nonsense frame-up. An opportunity came when Becky's driver got fired for having an affair with her maid and Albert volunteered to apply to replace him. He infiltrated the Pamintuan Residence and together with his four crazily daft friends they've gathered information about the curious family yet to them it isn't making any sense at all especially Becky's unexplained hatred to the five of them. Why is Becky fighting so hard to have them suffer? The Moron 5 will try their hardest to know and hopefully understand what's really going on although little did they know that by doing so everything that they hold dear might be at risk.
