Siham Raadi a 30-year-old Iraqi woman was found slaughtered in her room in the Student Campus in Sofia July 1988. She was the wife of Hussein Salman a Iraqi and a former fellow-student of the filmmakers at the National Academy of Theatre and Film Art in Sofia. The murderer has not been found. Was Siham part of a greater game? At the time Sofia was the European center of the Iraqi secret services; the Soviet block was supporting Saddam and at the same time was giving refuge to those prosecuted by his regime. Obviously that tricky game took its toll. Even today nobody is interested in the reopening of the case.
