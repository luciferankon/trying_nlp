Not writing about the plot but about the TOUR! By dad was the pilot chosen to fly BOB HOPE on this tour and had the time of his life! I have a lot of black and white/sepia shots and an article written about the 'girls' on the plane. and nobody knew my dad was "Instructed that there was ground artillery fired so my dad USAF Robert B Parker made a steep climb and then passed a note to the crew so they knew it was intentional! Got some home movies too but "NO TALKIES!" We were bummed when my dad's name was not mentioned as the pilot but the 'other pilot' was! Luckily he had proof:-) Now my son in law who is a Marine Major takes over for the military part of our family who was deployed 4times to Iraq/Afghanistan before his final assignment in DC area.
