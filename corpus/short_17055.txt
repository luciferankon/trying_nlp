Demonstrating the brand-new technique of close-up through the use of a circular mask the director alternates medium shots with extreme point-of-view shots to simulate the magnification of various objects. As a sweet grandmother organises her sewing basket Willy her inquisitive little grandson plays with her magnifying glass to look at the inside of a pocket watch only to soon turn his attention to a caged bird grandmother's rolling eye and lastly a well-fed cat. A child borrows his grandmother's magnifying glass to look at a newspaper ad for Bovril at a watch and then at a bird. The child shows grandma what he is doing. The child looks next at grandma's eye then at a kitten.
