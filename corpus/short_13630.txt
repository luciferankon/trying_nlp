After wishing to build a playhouse out of a cardboard box three young children are transported to join Boxter (the animated box) and Builder Bette in Boxville. There they are taught the basic ideas of carpentry roofing painting and landscaping through the incorporation of singing and dancing. The video also features a visit from Professor Squeezebox and a spectacular performance by Boxville's friend Bonnie West. Boxtime encourages the use of artistic creativity and individualism helping our viewers to realize how important and unique they are.
