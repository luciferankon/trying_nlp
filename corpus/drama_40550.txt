A tedious morning in a district court somewhere in Dublin Mrs Bridie Foley sits anxiously waiting to hear the clerk call her son's name. Bernard Foley has recently been keeping company with small time career criminal Anthony Clarke they have both been caught stealing a car and are waiting to get their court date. Bridie has had to take out a credit union loan just to pay for a solicitor and is offering her children's allowance book as a guarantee to the court that he will show up for his court appearance leaving her younger children vulnerable. A mothers sacrifice to keep her family intact.
