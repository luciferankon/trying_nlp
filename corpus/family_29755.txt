On Martin's tenth birthday strange things start happening in the ancient forest. Even the friendly chestnut tree seems worried. A couple of strangers arrive from the city to live in Martin's house. Although the lonely Martin desired company for a long time the newcomer girl Teah spells nothing but trouble as she ruthlessly invades his world. As if that were not enough another disaster lurks on the horizon: malicious signs appearing on trees indicate the impending building of a motorway right through the heart of the magical forest. Can it be that the ancient trees will be cut for the sake of a new road? Magic and reality are inseparable in the forest. Is there a way to face reality and preserve the magic? What Martin needs most urgently is a true friend. Together they can fight for the survival of the forest. A big revelation awaits Martin on the road of this struggle: the source of magic resides not in the forest but in the hearts of people.
