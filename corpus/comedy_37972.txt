Nothing to Report follows the day-to-day adventures of Chance Blackstreet (Chris Jericho) and Moses Packard (Nick Mundy) two cops who operate in the vein of action duos like Riggs and Murtaugh and Tango and Cash -- only with much less investigating and a lot more sitting in the car. Actual crime notwithstanding they'll get the job done -- just as soon as they deal with their emotional baggage.
