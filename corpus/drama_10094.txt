JOSEPH AND MARY is a biblical drama that follows Elijah a devout Rabbi during a time of unrest when King Herod the Great's slaughter of innocents claims the lives of two boys Elijah had sworn to protect. Consequently he makes it his life's mission to avenge their deaths according to the laws of the land. Complications ensue when Elijah spends time with Joseph Mary and their young Son who challenges the very beliefs that fuel Elijah's quest for retribution. He begins to question the true identity of this young boy. Could Jesus possibly be the Son of God? Was Elijah bearing witness to a two thousand year old prophecy? When the time comes to face his life-long enemy Elijah finds himself warring within whether or not to kill or to turn the other cheek and choose forgiveness contradicting every scripture upheld by Elijah's forefathers. JOSEPH AND MARY is a story of inspiration and hope of mercy versus revenge in the years before Jesus became the Man that ultimately changed the course of humanity forever.
