Reuniting after more than a year apart breast cancer survivors Cindy and Asha celebrate five years of remission with a trip to exotic Playa Tamarindo on Costa Rica's Pacific coast. Traveling with their best friend Sheila -- who supported them through their treatment -- the girls encounter crocodiles and monkeys in the jungle "fly" through the trees on a harrowing zip line tour surf with a hunky Italian instructor and flirt their way through the nightclub scene. All the while they reflect on their triumph over cancer and come closer together as friends.
