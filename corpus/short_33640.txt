PILLOWTALK is the story of a woman who learns that her boyfriend has been unfaithful when she discovers several uniquely feminine items planted around his apartment. Instead of confronting her boyfriend on his two-timing behavior she begins to plant items of her own around his apartment for the other female party to discover and in essence "mark her territory". A silent dialogue begins with the two women through the careful and strategic placement of their belongings/items throughout the man's apartment that goes completely unnoticed to him as he believes he is getting away with cheating on two different women. Their strategic "hide and seek" escalates to the point of confrontation between all the parties involved in the love triangle.
