The film is a female orientated story based on a dreadful tragedy of a dedicated and educated village woman (lawyer) respectfully known as Tai (meaning elder sister) who chooses a valiant but perilous avenue. She unfortunately suffers sexually as well as psychologically in her personal life yet altruistically battles for a common cause of protecting acres of land owned by the village farmers and deprived poverty stricken village community from the clutches of the corridor of Power Builders (the land sharks) and of course not forgetting the voracious politicians.
