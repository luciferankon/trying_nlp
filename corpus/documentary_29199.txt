Where can a mother obsessed by the desire of power arrive? Are there unacceptable means in the political world? How can people be manipulated? Does the end justify the means? "Facing Agrippina" is a documentary in which the Grammy award winner conductor René Jacobs the designer Christian Lacroix the French director Vincent Boussard the soprano Alexandrina Pendatchanska and all the cast transform the search for answers to the issues of rule and power in a paradise for the senses. The director Nayo Titzin guides us through Händel's music across the halls of the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin discovers the marble busts of the main characters in the halls of the Louvre and finally accepts the challenge to face Agrippina.
