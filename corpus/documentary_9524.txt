In true Mondo form the film starts off with a visit to a slaughterhouse and then takes off on a non-stop sonic run through Africa in search of firewalkers Snake charmers babes in bikinis and anything strange and unusual. Finally the film ties everything together with a special focus on witchdoctors and their sundry rites and mutilations.
