Rich young Joan Hope is ashamed of how her father made his money--as a chewing gum magnate. While taking a train trip she meets the Countess of Crex a member of the Russian nobility--who is in reality a jewel thief. Entranced by the "countess" and her royal image--a far cry from her father's "vulgar" business--Joan agrees to change places with her. It turns out to be more trouble than she bargained for.
