For 60 years the Alliance for Women in Media (formerly AWRT) has served as the voice and resource for women in the media. And for more than three decades the Foundation has been a leader in celebrating and honoring programming created for women by women and about women as well as individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the industry. The Gracies strive to encourage the realistic and faceted portrayal of women in entertainment commercials news features and other programs.
