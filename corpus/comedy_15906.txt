He's friendly and attractive and seems to have everything going for him. In fact you might assume Jack is one of the luckiest guys around. But most don't know that Jack was horribly disfigured at birth making him incapable of forming close relationships with women. Things start looking up however when Jack learns of a medical procedure that can reverse his condition. With the help of his womanizing best friend Alan and an eccentric doctor named Skinner Jack tries to win the heart of the girl next door and obtain the life he's always wanted. Things turn comically tragic however when things don't quite go as planned.
