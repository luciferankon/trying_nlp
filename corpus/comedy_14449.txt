Dad Drives tells the story of Malcolm and his Dad. Just home from University Malcolm needs some time to figure out his next step in life. But while he's home he'll have to deal with his trying-to-be-cool father who just wants to hang out and crack jokes. Malcolm can generally avoid Dad except when he wants to get anywhere because Dad has the only car and insists on driving it. So Malcolm is beholden to Dad's errands whims and brainstorms. And he has so many brainstorms.
