A commissioned project made for TV in honor the the 200th anniversary of Mozart's death this is a highly avant-garde piece of music theater and dance set to an original score by the controversial Dutch composer Louis Andriessen (who would later collaborate with Greenaway on the operas "Rosa" and "Writing to Vermeer"). Four nude powder-white dancers (representing the Gods) appear on a stage designed in the style of an 18th century anatomy theater. A woman sings a list of objects beginning with various letters of the alphabet up to "M"; the Gods then decide to create Man assembling him from body parts listed as onscreen text. Having created Man the Gods then give him Movement; so as to give him a reason to move they create Music; finally so as to have Perfect Music they create Mozart.
