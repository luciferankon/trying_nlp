Through the eyes and words of New York's Bravest FDNY Firefighter Brian Hickey and his brother Ray beautifully capture a snapshot of life as Firefighter in the busiest fire department on Earth as it was in 1990. Brian and Ray take us along with Fire Companies in all five boroughs to Probationary Fireman's School the FDNY's 125th Anniversary Celebration and of course Medal Day. Riding along we come to appreciate and understand that Firefighters are truly a close brotherhood fighting to ensure that others may live. To this day Brothers in Battle continues to be shown at the FDNY Fire Academy-and remains an outstanding historical snapshot of FDNY.
