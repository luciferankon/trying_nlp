Two sculptural ceramicists share a four-day residency in an old brick school building and together create eleven extraordinary heads. This short documentary shows the intimacy of a communal creative project it explores the creative process especially regarding clay work and it explores the role of place in creativity as an old building in a post-industrial town which was scheduled for demolition finds new life as an arts center. The ceramicists are Doug Jeck long a prominent worker in the field. The other is Christine Golden who once did a paper on Doug Jeck when she was in graduate school. Christine won the inaugural $20000 Zanesville Prize in Contemporary Ceramics and when Doug Jeck saw her prize-winning piece the next year when he was a judge in the next competition he knew this was someone he wanted to work with. The film documents day by day how the two artists craft a startling and stunning array of psyches gazes and visages. Zanesville once a rich and bustling town because of its industrial clay production now one more of the many sagging post-industrial cities in the Midwest is in the process of reinventing itself with an arts and culture identity. The Zanesville Prize is a key element of this movement as is the Pioneer School Zanesville (PSZ) project. Duet captures the kind of creativity Zanesville is just beginning to attract.
