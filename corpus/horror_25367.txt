ST. FRANKENSTEIN is a contemporary return to the classic gothic morality tale twisted with taboo-smashing blasphemy otherworldly lust and blood-chilling terror. In this blend of horror and psychodrama FATHER ANTON FRANKENSTEIN seeks to redeem his infamous family name by converting Castle Frankenstein into an abbey and furthering the original Dr. Frankenstein's ghastly experiments this time toward a divine end - but again with unintended and even more terrifying results.
