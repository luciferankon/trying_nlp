Typhoon Morakot caused a disastrous mudslide and destroyed peaceful Hsiaolin Village on August 8 2009 killing many villagers. For more than two years survivors have wondered how things turned out this way. Some people try to reunite with the dead through psychics; others put their hope in the child they are about to have; and others are still haunted by the pains of losing their families. This documentary painstakingly records villagers' never-ending hardships and their indomitable spirit as they try to rebuild their lives
