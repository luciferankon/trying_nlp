We re-trace the steps of Holocaust survivor Israel Arbeiter as he returns to Poland and Germany for the final time to look for items buried in 1939 in the basement of his old home in Plock Poland as the German army advanced. We also travel with "Izzy" to Treblinka death camp where he parents and younger brother were murdered and to other camps most notably Auschwitz-Birkenau where "Izzy" used the motivation of his father's final words to him to stay alive. He is also reunited with those who at great risk helped him to stay alive. A somewhat strained impromptu meeting with a former German soldier is also chronicled. Airing on American Public Television.
