Behind The Lines takes a look at the men and women behind the scenes of a California Wildfire. This is a rare look at the people and activities in a base camp and the sheer magnitude of effort needed to support the firefighters. From the woman who brings portable showers to national incidents to the Incident Commander himself this film goes beyond what is ever seen on the news and may answer some questions for the public who wonder "why can't they just put this thing out?"
