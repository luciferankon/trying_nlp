The GHOST is the road. This is a DOCU-STORY. The "DOCU" literally documents accurate history of the entire 2200-mile journey from Chicago to Santa Monica through six decades. The show was shot in all four seasons. The "STORY" is a fictional account of the GHOST telling stories along the way about the birth of the FILLIN' STATION DINER MOTORCOURT and DRIVE-INS. Thanks to the mass of foreign visitors from the Far East Europe and an American renewed interest in ROUTE 66 you'll be surprised to learn that ROUTE 66 is as alive today perhaps more so than decades ago. Thus making it economically viable for not only domestic but international distribution as well. Who better to tell a great American story of the most famous road in America than the GHOST OF ROUTE 66?
