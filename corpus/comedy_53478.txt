Phil Schultz is a responsible thoughtful introspective witty Los Angelino. Sam Daniels is a whip-smart hard-drinking hard-smoking action-oriented womanizer... oh yeah and a lesbian. Two friends both in long-term monogamous relationships find their worlds turned upside-down when each are victims of a blindsided breakup. But similar lives changed by similar circumstances don't always yield similar results. The brutal breakups cause opposite reactions- Phil puts himself in relationship exile hiding his heart away and cutting himself off from all romantic possibilities. Sam goes off the opposite deep end becoming a promiscuous player jumping from one meaningless one-night stand to the next. However the one thing they still have in common is their need for each other. Phil moves in with Sam and the friends vow to 'fix each other.' Sam guarantees she'll shake Phil from his shell while Phil claims he's going to reel Sam in from her life of debauchery. Somewhere in between their opposing polar positions is a happy medium and they promise to help each other discover it. Phil and Sam learn that while misery loves company commiserating is company. This show is about what a broken heart can do-- how it hurts how it heals and how we lean on our friends to make us whole again. It's about two best friends who say 'We're gonna save each other' and back it up.
