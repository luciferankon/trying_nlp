His younger sister the idealistic Aneta ('Vanda Hybnerová' (qv)) is an investigative journalist writing about political scandals. Thanks to her work for which she sacrifices everything her personal life falls apart. The middle sibling Bruno ('Miroslav Vladyka' (qv)) has held on to a childish view of the world as he has avoided real life. Each one is totally different yet they all try to stick together.
