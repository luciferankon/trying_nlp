220 MILES documents the journey of the brave New Zealand women who decided to take a stand against family violence and establish the Waikato Women's Refuge Te Whakaruruhau. Their story unearths the truth about family violence in rural New Zealand and their determination to create solace for those in mortal danger and be the voice for victims who cannot speak for themselves. On their journey they are met with many seemingly unsurmountable challenges that threatens their vision. During the course of 220 MILES we see how they were inspired by their ancestors who had a similar vision for the people of Aotearoa and how Samaritans and business people rise up with them to create a sustainable refuge for all women men and children.
