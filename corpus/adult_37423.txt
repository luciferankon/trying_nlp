Mrs. Seville is a sex therapist who has a strong hold over her latest therapy group...filled with patients who are "sexaholics." The group proves very challenging as two of them sneak off for a "quickie" even before the first session begins. As each member of the group relates his or her experiences everyone gets turned on. As Ms. Seville counsels each alone in her office total sexual chaos takes place outside. By the time she has talked to each patient she has lost much of her willpower until she finally succumbs to one of the girls she is treating. The sessions ends with the therapist turned patient...confessing to the whole group her inability to cope with unbridled sex. Naked the group then clusters about her...!
