He witnesses his daughter Pooja being molested by Kali the son of gangster Dhabla objects to this behavior but is silenced by Dhabla. Pooja is in love with a young man named Raja. One day Pooja is sexually assaulted by Kali and a group of his friends who then throw her to her death from the roof of an under-construction building. Raja witnesses this and reports this to the police. Inspector Shirke instead charges Raja for this crime. Pooja's brother Vijay finds out and attempts to try and put a stop to this injustice. Shortly thereafter Raja is killed and Vijay is charged for killing him and held in a cell. The charge against Vijay is that he killed Raja out of anger for molesting his sister a charge that may carry the death sentence. Kali is a local ruffian who harasses students in his college. The principal Satyaprakash is helpless to stop him because Kali is the son of Dabala who is one of the biggest gangsters in town. The principal has 2 sons and 1 daughter - Vikas Vijay and Pooja. Vijay is in love with Priya a colleague of his in his engineering company. Kali rapes Pooja and then the corrupt inspector Shirke puts the blame on Pooja's fianc√©e and has him killed while in custody. This enrages Vijay and he embarks upon a bloody and violent fight to cleanse the city of ruffians like Kali and Dabala and Shirke. Dabla is a gangster who would murder anyone standing in his way. He also has the local police on his payroll; when Vijay an engineer gets into his bad books he has him frame through Inspector Shirke for the murder of a man named Raja who was once in love with Vijay's sister Pooja. To worsen matter Dabla has plans to do away with Vijay's entire family while he is in police custody.
