This documentary is based on the remarkable life and philosophy of Bob Randall an elder of the Yankunytjatjara people of Uluru in Central Australia. It explores his idyllic early life shattered when he is taken from his family as one of the 'Stolen Generation' and his journey since then. 'Uncle Bob' also explores the reasons for the tragic problems in many Australian Aboriginal communities today. While there is sadness and desperation the film finishes with a sense of hope. Archival footage from the very early days of white contact with indigenous peoples is skilfully interwoven into the film.
