The Marshmallow Ghosts Graveface Records' Halloween band presents this omnibus of spooky music videos centered around a hearse tour company in Savannah Georgia. The guide Louis recounts various Savannah ghost stories and legends to his seemingly lone patron Paige. Her bizarre and dazzling visions make up the individual music videos tied together by Louis' storytelling. "Hearse Song" sees a man at work being harassed by unseasonable trick-or-treaters. He meets an untimely sugary end. "The Attic" features a little girl's psychedelic decomposition. A pig farmer and his brother perform at a carnival in "Pigman's Bridge" with grave results. A witchy fantasy for "Trick" takes a turn for the demonic. In "Wait for the Day" a lengthy hospital stay gives new meaning to "vegetative state." The hearse tour ends at a ghastly soiree for the video "White Satin Gown" where Paige immediately senses something is amiss. 'Corpse Reviver No. 2' is the 'other' side of The Marshmallow Ghosts debut.
