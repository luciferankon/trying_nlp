This is a unique and intimate exploration of a single oil painting and the first major film to reveal the motive and techniques behind each stroke of paint as the artist is creating. Filmed over four intensive months what starts as a blank canvas emerges Peter Howson's monumental oil painting; PROPHECY. We are granted a unique insight into the artist's mind. Howson reveals to us as he labours a deeply religious and troubled yet surprisingly humorous man. Working from his imagination Howson draws inspiration from is heroes Goya DaVinci Brugel and El Greco. The film sticks deliberately and rigorously to the frame work of the painting itself; observing the canvas as it is mounted onto a wooden stretcher through its turbulent creation in the artist's Glasgow studio crossing the Atlantic to its first public exhibition in a New York gallery and then reaching its final destination on the wall of a private art collector in London. Inventive filming techniques and hypnotic camera work make the invisible visible revealing how the unseen images in the artist's head are transferred to canvas. We discover the intentions and difficulties that push his creative output and how he achieves this ambitious masterful and detailed 6ft x 8ft canvas. This film draws us right into the artist's eye magnifying the apocalyptic world of Peter Howson's painting; PROPHECY.
