Parviz Tanavoli is Iran's greatest living sculptor. As a guardian of ancient traditions and innovator of new forms of artistic expression Tanavoli's contribution to the modern art movement of the Middle East is without equal. "Poetry in Bronze" tells the remarkable story of this esteemed artist's journey of creation that has spanned three continents over more than half a century. The film sheds light on how the legendary Tanavoli was inspired to create his unique body of work. Following his formal training as a sculptor in Italy Tanavoli returned to Iran where he found inspiration in both historic Persian and modern Iranian folk art culture and poetry. He brazenly broke with tradition and began creating modern art works with a distinctly Iranian aesthetic. The documentary features exclusive interviews with Tanavoli and leading figures in the international art world who illuminate the emergence and rise of this extraordinary artist.
