Vito Acconci Joan Jonas Chris Burden... Frank Cole? Yes with this movie Cole emerges as a performance artist extraordinaire. His body like theirs is a machine for producing pictures. A Life is Cole's nearly wordless performance for the camera with Cole back-and-for thing between a horizon-less Sahara and a room that contains only a desk and a bed. Figure and ground mash-up in a duet that sends his grandfather's ashes scattered across a continent to create a newly emptied world. The long road of grieving brings him a burning car a new tattoo and a long snake duet.
