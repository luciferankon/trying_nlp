Dr. Arbutus Budd is a New York physician specializing in "beauty". His business is successful but he is still plagued by money problems. One day he gets an idea--he obtains the coat-of-arms of a long-forgotten Italian noble family the Bolognias and uses it as his logo on his line of beauty products. As luck would have it the crest is recognized in Italy and before long an emissary is sent to the US to bring back "The Baron". Budd is overjoyed as he believes that he is about to inherit the Bolognia family fortune. However it turns out that all he inherits is something he wasn't counting on--a blood feud with a local bandit.
