After nine years of tap dancing in a small nightclub the brothers Franz and Heinz lose their jobs. Lacking significant funds they are forced to move out of their apartment possessing only the tuxedos on their backs. Due to their exquisite attire the brothers are mistaken by others as being pall-bearers godfathers from the United States waiters and wedding guests. The brothers stroll through an absurd universe encountering awkward funny and somewhat grotesque situations. Overnight two elderly tap-dancers become unemployed and homeless. All that remains is the timeless tuxedo - and that gets them into some weird and wonderful situations. A tragic-comedy about two outsiders in a social fabric governed by accepted rules and rituals.
