Three Christs is based on an extraordinary experiment that began in 1959 at Michigan's Ypsilanti State Hospital. It tells the story of Dr. Alan Stone and his three paranoid schizophrenic patients who each believe they are Jesus Christ. Dr. Stone pioneers a simple yet revolutionary treatment: instead of submitting the patients to electroshock forced restraints and tranquilization he puts them in a room together to confront them. Will this force them to give up their delusions? After all there can be but one Jesus. What transpires is a darkly comic intensely dramatic story about the nature of identity and the power of empathy.
