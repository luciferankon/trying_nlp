Verdict Day is set around 100 years after the events of Armored Core V. Following The Raven's victory over Exusia the contamination that isolated humanity had begun to subside allowing humans to return to more of the world. The discovery of high-tech Towers once hidden by the contamination ignited a new war--known as the Verdict War--between several different factions. Adding to the conflict is a mysterious group known as the Reaper Squad as well as the usage of Unmanned Armored Cores called UNACs. The game follows the story of an unnamed AC pilot generally indicated as The Raven who accepts assignments on behalf of various factions encountering numerous mercenaries in battle before entering into conflict with the Reaper Squad and the Foundation.
