The corrupt banker and owner of the Banco Federal Luiz Fernando negotiates a slush fund of fifty-million Reais (twenty million dollar) with the corrupt businessman Carlăo. His graduated in Harvard assessor Romeiro receives a provisional check from Carlăo to be exchanged by a deposit in Switzerland in the afternoon. Meanwhile the naive middle-class bank manager of Banco Federal Roberto is proud of his twenty-five years of service working in the bank and worships Luiz Fernando. Together with his wife and teacher Angelina they are paying a bank loan to buy their house and support their only son Henrique (Thiago Fragoso) in the university. When Carlăo has a stroke and is interned in deep coma Luiz Fernando invites his secretary Ângela who is Henrique's girlfriend to be his figurehead and use her bank account to deposit the dirty check. In return he would pay seven hundred thousand Reais to her. Ângela accepts the bribe but Romeiro commits a mistake and deposits the check in Angelina's account. Meanwhile Roberto is fired with 599 other clerks in a downsizing operation and decides to kill his former "friend" Luiz Fernando.
