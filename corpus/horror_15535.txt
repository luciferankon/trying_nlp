Old St. Leopold's Hospital has many urban legends surrounding it but the residents of Bridgeport all agree on one thing: tortured souls roam its abandoned halls. The mystery proves too much for a pretty young student who decides to investigate for her senior class project. Unfortunately she does not find ghosts. She instead finds Stanley... serial rapist murderer and psychopath. As the young girl becomes Stanley's new pet a team of young investigators descend on the hospital to "hunt some ghosts." Stanley sees nothing but fun and games in his future. But what Stanley does not know is that the hospital truly is haunted and the restless spirits there are not happy with what he has been doing.
