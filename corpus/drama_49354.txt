Paris 2018 The days are brisk and sometimes cold and wet. the fall is coming and the changing vibe lingers over everything even relationships. Friends are seeking more than the Summer's dream. Lovers have had there last forest walks. Business allies from the previous seasons have had it and are now venturing out on their own. Criminals know people are stocking up for the hard times ahead the time when they strike. Anything can happen in the cold winter city. Paris' societies have come to together only to be ripped apart. In these dying days of the turning Fall lives are torn apart. But what was it like when they all came together? Did they know it would lead them down these dark paths? Will any one who came together stay together? And will someone purposefully tear everyone apart? You can only find when you witness and pay attention to what you love. Paris Mon Amour.
