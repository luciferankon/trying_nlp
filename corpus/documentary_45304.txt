The documentary "Die h√§usliche Seite des Krieges" (The Domestic Side of War) tells the stories of three military-families. It accompanies their daily lives and takes us into their homes. We learn how they deal with missing a loved one and how they experience the public discussion about whether or not it makes sense to deploy Bundeswehr-soldiers internationally.
