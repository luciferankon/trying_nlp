First appearing before music videos had become commonplace this show featured the week's top hits in pop music. Guest performers would occasionally appear on the show to play their songs. Typically however the only visual accompaniment to the music was the Solid Gold Dancers a dozen or so dancers in skimpy costumes who would perform interpretive renditions of such hits as "Down Under" and "Maniac".
