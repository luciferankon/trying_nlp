Mark is a young Italian enterpreneur specialized in investments on new territories in Tuscany with the partnership of American rich people. He is in vacation in Cinquale near to Forte dei Marmi with his girlfriend. Everything seems to be normal. But Mark hides a secret. People are not always the same. They change in some sort of way sometimes for a day sometimes just for minutes; maybe because they are drunk or because they are very sensitive or because for a while we would love to be someone else. But then after that moment they realize that they were the same human beings but not the same people they ask theirselves "was really me"?
