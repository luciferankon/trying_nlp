Lucy a privileged North American in contemporary Berlin living a life of post Punk hedonism roams the streets with her best friend Derek. Together they use the city like a playground a stage and a never ending party. Into their lives enters Galia a young Israeli woman carrying the promise of a better cleaner way of living. A tribute to Punk underground films turns into a melodrama in "Saturn Returns" mirroring Lucy and Galia's modulating states of mind. Our and their look into each other's life and culture becomes an investigation of empty facades. The film was constructed by both improvised and pre-scripted scenes as required by the nature of each scene.
