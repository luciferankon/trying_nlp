Is nuclear power the fossil-fuel alternative that will save us from global climate change? Scientists at MIT in Cambridge Massachusetts are working to develop the next generation of nuclear reactors. They argue that nuclear fission holds the promise of producing the electric energy we demand without emitting any carbon dioxide. But anti-nuclear activists in Plymouth Massachusetts and Seabrook New Hampshire are fighting back against their local power plants. They insist that no nuclear power technology is safe. Instead they advocate for renewable energy sources. "Nuclear Climate Change" explores these stories and illuminates the conflict over the safety affordability and necessity of nuclear power.
