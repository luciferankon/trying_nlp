In 1989 Alfredo Márquez used an image of Mao in an artwork. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. For every artist the need to create and be heard is as basic as food and shelter. But what happens when you live in a country where the state clamps down on free thinkers forcing artists to censure themselves? Four Peruvian visual artists including Márquez defy this tyranny through their work and ignite change challenging ordinary people to speak out. These struggles and commitments raise the question: Is freedom of expression a right or a privilege?
