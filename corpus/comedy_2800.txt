An inspector in the Bulgarian Anti-Terrorist Agency is due to lose his job and produces a report identifying an innocent boy as the leader of a terrorist cell. His success-hungry Agency boss orders surveillance of the kid who is meanwhile crushed by a split from his long-time girlfriend and undertakes actions that look very suspicious for any observer and enough to convince the Agency in the youth's guilt leading to his arrest. Feeling remorse for the kid the inspector admits his guilt to the boy in custody. But surprisingly the youth devises a plan to turn all negatives into opportunities forcing the inspector into his scheme. The two form an unusual criminal tandem to steal substantial financial resources from available anti-terrorist funds playing a dangerous faux terrorist theatre. When their scheme is finally revealed for the scam it is all players are so mired into the lies they have created that the only way out is to turn those lies into truths. Which could be easily achievable in the country they live in and so absurd indeed that may confuse some real terrorists...
