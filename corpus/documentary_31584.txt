From pieces of papers glued together are drawn and lined up the natures of multifaceted characters. From luxury magazines exhibiting the opulence of an unreachable world are exposed figures who have broken and changed History. From goods which promote a dream of extreme consumption are brought to light the dreams and the ideal of a whole people. This is not a subject about class struggle but a way to highlight a paradox between a South fighting for food and a North avid for expansion. This is not a subject about a technical curiosity of an original artist but how to highlight the comments and the concern of a "his-(s)tory" conscious citizen. This is not a subject about diverting views but a reminder of comfortably forgotten stories. This is not a subject about an artist with demands but gathered pieces of demands from men and women who choose to make their dreams true.
