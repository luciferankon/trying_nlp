They arrived to Manhattan in the 80s and the 90s a place where their lives were transformed forever. The director Gustavo SÃ¡nchez started his filming with the idea of capturing New Yorks underground scene and somehow among hundreds of hours of footage he discovered four heroines of titanic force and one of the most powerful brave and unconventional love stories that we have ever seen on a screen. This documentary is an intimate portrait and devastatingly moving journey that offers an intense follow up of survivor artists fighting an extenuating combat towards freedom.They are living within the margins of activism transgender culture and the nightlife in the New Yorks underground now in extinction. They all reveal non-conventional ways of living going against the grain to push changes that transform Western culture today. Shot with a handycam over 10 years (between 2007 and 2017) "I Hate New York" offers an alternative and close vision to one of the most underrated sides of the underground subculture of New York City. It is a sincere document with an activist soul that beyond its artistic value it is touching original and unique. Original music by Arca.
