Guohui and Peiling were childhood sweethearts who met again after years of being apart and became a couple. On an idyllic island south of Singapore they spend their last moments together as their relationship falls apart. The film is about the impossibility to know what has made people change. Through the ever-changing landscape Guohui and Peiling realise that what is transitory is also eternal.
