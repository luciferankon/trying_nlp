Ray and Brian two hapless guys who wait under a tree for a man known simply as "Al." They don't know how long they will be waiting so they must come up with ways to pass the time. They consider hanging themselves to pass the time - but decide that's no good. They later consider doing their exercises - but that's too difficult. They have a thumb war - but are interrupted in the middle of it. Delilah a girl who breezes in on a scooter sees Ray and Brian waiting under the tree and becomes curious. She thinks they're foolish for waiting so long for someone they've never met and never even seen. She questions if this man Al even exists at all. So who is right and who is wrong? Is Al ever going to show up or is Ray and Brian's waiting pointless?
