'Intake-Release' is the tightly-sequenced story of two fateful days in the lives of two childhood friends from the same hardscrabble Maine mill town. Steve Ryan a prison guard working his shifts eight hours at a time and Chris Cattinni a prison inmate. The story opens on the day of Cattini's release. Over the next 48 hours each will make a series of decisions that underscore the fundamental differences between their characters - why they are on different sides of the bars despite both growing up together but on the wrong side of the tracks. In an intense fact based drama these decisions will determine the rest of their lives and the lives of those they love.
