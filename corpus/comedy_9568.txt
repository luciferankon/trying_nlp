When hyperactive egotistical Ste moves in to share a rented house life is not the same for quiet Peter and theater loving Melissa. The camera crew have a field-day following around these three unknown actors. Ste has just moved from London and is looking for an agent in Manchester. He loves the attention from the cameras. Peter would rather be left alone. Melissa is rehearsing a play with eight other actors and seems the most sensible of the three. Over the week leading up to the night of the performance we discover both Ste and Peter have secrets. But all three will have their lives turned upside down on performance night. Three actors under the same roof is too much.
