The Mission of Pathfinder Outdoors television shows is to reduce the 22 American veteran suicides each day by engaging veterans most prone to suicide those living with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Our purpose is simply to facilitate healing and PTSD management through supervised outdoor activities Christ-centered focus and mentor ship encouragement and overall spiritual growth. Many veteran experiences will be captured as keepsakes for the veterans as well as a vehicle to share their stories experiences and testimonials with the public at large via our TV program. Our message then is simply to offer hope and healing to unseen casualties of wartime service at a pivotal time when their worlds seem hopeless.
