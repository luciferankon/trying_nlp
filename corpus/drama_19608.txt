CHARLIE is in her final year of her Bachelor of Psychology studies; not only determined to establish her own prominent Mental Health Practice but even more driven to appease her often displeased Mother HARRIET herself a reputable and notable Clinical Psychologist. Charlie is left to rearrange the Practice's schedule of patients' appointments as Harriet is suddenly called overseas on an emergency personal errand. Here enters HERNAN an impetuously impulsive recusant with a vast history of aggressive and hostile behaviour recently arrested for assault and thus facing a lengthy jail sentence. He's encouraged to undergo therapy hoping it may support the portraying of his genuine strive towards rehabilitation. With Harriet suddenly unavailable and his court case in thirteen days Charlie is his only hope.
