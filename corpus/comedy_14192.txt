More than 60 years have past since Israel's dramatic fight for independence. The values that once were the building blocks of Israeli society are now mostly forgotten. The statue of Alexander Zaid who once was an Israeli national hero is visited today less for its heritage and more for being an excellent make-out spot for the neighboring teenagers. But for an Israeli family the Zionist pioneer riding his proud stallion is still worth a whole lot - more than 2000 dollars in pure bronze. The statue travels from one greedy hand to another while Alik Zaid steps out of his grandfather's shadow to become a hero - a pathetic one - but a hero nonetheless. As father and son fight for retrieving the statue they soon enough find themselves deep in trouble. 'Half a Ton of Bronze' is a mix of a Middle-Eastern western and a cynical comedy about a world in which values are sold by the pound.
