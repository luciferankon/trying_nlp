King Udayapandyan ruled some provinces of Tamil Nadu 600 years ago. He fell in love with a huntress named Mathangi (Ramya Krishnan) married her and built her a bungalow near the forest. When Udayapandyan is defeated in a war he takes shelter at Mathangi's bungalow and she vows to take care of the king. She sacrifices her life before the deity Bhadrakali to save the life of King Udayapandyan. However Mathangi's spirit continues to stay on and a yogi (Om Puri) performs certain rituals to rein in her spirit. When this myth continues it affects the life of a well-known businessman Satyajith (Jayaram) who leads a happy life with his family.
