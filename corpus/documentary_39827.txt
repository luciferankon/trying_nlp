A Documentary that attempts to recover and reconstruct the relationship between my mother who lost her memory about two years ago due to an accident and her best friend who disappeared during the Chilean military dictatorship and was pregnant at the moment of her arrest. A destiny we don't know; a failed attempt to recover of memory; a reflection upon friendship motherhood and loss.
