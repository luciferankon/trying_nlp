The documentary dramatizes the recruiting and training of a young men into the Greek police during the 1967-1974 military junta rule. Seemingly decent young men are selected based on traits viewed as exploitable by the recruiters : illiterate anti-communist young and male. The film interviews Michailis Petrou one of the Greek policeman involved in the tortures who agreed to testify against his peers in exchange for a reduced sentence. Petrou's testimony reveals that the training methods themselves were brutal and often torturous and was viewed as a necessity to ensure the robotic and brutal obedience of the trainees. During the dramatic reenactments of the training camps the directors draw parallels to modern military boot camps and the methods used in the training of soldiers.
