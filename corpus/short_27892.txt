Little Gladys and Claude are playing in the nursery. Claude has monopolized the building blocks to the extreme perturbation of Gladys. She with sly procedure knocks over the little castle Claude has built. The children at once engage in a bitter quarrel and Gladys leaves the room going into the dining room just after the maid has put some cream puffs on the table. Gladys appropriates them and Claude enters and asks for a share which she refuses. He then eats up the sugar which is left on the plate. Mamma enters as Gladys sneaks out of the room and discovering the loss of the puffs accuses Claude who mutely receives the punishment a switching. Gladys hearing this is seized with a spirit of contrition and coming from her hiding place says "I did it mamma" and picks up the switch hands it to mamma saying "whip me."
