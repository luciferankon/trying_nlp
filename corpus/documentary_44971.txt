Oblivion is our biggest fear and cinema has the capacity to bring back to life for a moment those whose memory has been captured on film. My mother and my uncle passed away in an extraordinary way that symbolized true friendship and the love between siblings. Their passing was the most important thing that ever happened in my life and I keep the story as a treasure. When my nephew was born I knew that I needed to make it into a film so that he could get to know his ancestors and the magic and poetry that existed between them.
