Rebecca leaves large corporate theatre MegaFilmPlex to manage at an independent movie theatre Cinema Six. Kicking off a new phase in her career she meets: the owner David Darvis who has a number of businesses but loves the theatre as it reminds him of his first job; Andrew a burdened General Manager with MacGyver-like abilities; Jordan a clerk who continually questions himself; Sunny a bright smiling young woman who tries to hold back her dark thoughts; and George an agitated Canadian Goose who guards the parking lot. Tossed into the deep end of running a smaller theatre Rebecca has to deal with personnel issues a video game machine that rewards winners with pornographic pictures and fight off attempts from her former boss Herb and his sidekick Harv to hijack Cinema Six's special advance movie premiere for the action sequel Cardinal Kickboxer 2.
