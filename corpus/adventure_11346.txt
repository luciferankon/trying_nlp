Written by author and poet Ahmed Salmeen and directed by award-winning Emirati Waleed Al Shehhi Dolphins revolves around Fadel an ambulance driver who is divorced and has one son Saud who lives with his mother Kawthar. Saud lives in a state of uncertainty due to the separation of his parents which leads him and his friend Hilal on an unusual adventure with an extraordinary outcome. Dolphins is a story of three paths that happen within twenty-four hours. Those paths extend to an open ended destiny. There are three separate worlds ostensibly but intertwined in depth within one social community: Femininity masculinity and childhood. Each story will have an equal opportunity to describe its image in the society and justify its rebellious towards the other stories and the society as a whole. The script won the IWC Award for Gulf Filmmakers.
