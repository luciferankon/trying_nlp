Three friends see life in the city. Ana (Hilda Koronel) became the mistress of a wealthy married man Roy (Dindo Fernando). Candy (Maria Isabel Lopez) left her boyfriend Dick (Raul Aragon) for a much older but wealthy man Peter (Eddie Garcia). She became suicidal after she found out that Peter the old man she has an affair with is actually a married man while Millie (Lorna Tolentino) found true love where it had always been there along after long fruitless search. In the ends they reflect on the things they should never have done in the first place wondering what might have been had these tomorrows been their yesterdays.
