This title is record of authentic theatre play. The subject is composition of series of real secret records of phone calls between soccer bosses in Czech soccer underground brought to investigation in 2004. The most absurd parts used Petr Ctvrtnicek to compose this performance given in form of text recitation as it were the phone calls while the actors are sitting in chairs in front of audience having the screenplay by hand.
