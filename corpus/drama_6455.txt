Recognizing that she has been suffering the same loneliness and emotional isolation that he has Jamie encourages Kacie to be with this new man and pursue what makes her happy. When she does Jamie immediately realizes that he has not drifted as far away from her as he thought and suffers immensely trying to continue to be her friend while she fosters a relationship with a new partner. The situation quickly becomes untenable and through the trauma of the resulting conflict Jamie and Kacie experience a renewed sense of intimacy between them but realize that it may be too late to remain a part of each other's lives.
