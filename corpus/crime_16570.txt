In the late 1990s the United States government attempts to expand its influence throughout Eastern Europe which is torn apart by endless military conflicts. More refugees begin to flee and arrive in Russia where they are being placed in refugee camps. Vadim Markov a popular television host risks his own life to expose the fraudulent elections in one of the Eastern European states fearing the possibility of a rise of the US-backed neo-Fascist regime to power. He suddenly learns that one of his sons got framed for the murder of a son of one of the presidential candidates and faces execution while his other son (from another wife) remained in the war-torn Balkans. While trying to save both of his sons Markov is being persecuted by his enemies who try to kill him and his family.
