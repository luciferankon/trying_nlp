An alternative portrait of the crisis-hit capital of Greece. Although filmed during a dramatic period the film does not focus on any factual details of troubled Athens. Instead it sees the polis in depression as a stage where the real drama takes place outside the frame. Through series of static observations the film is giving space to the leftovers and the anodyne daily life that persists. Captured fragments of 'reality' recompose a 'fictional' space allowing to imagine possible experiences. The film results from a four years work-in-progress experimental filming reflecting the city and its people during a period of profound mutation. Athens in its symbolic meaning which is the place of democracy per se is peeled off from its principles and could reflect a no longer existing public space and dialogue.
