Miss Tickle transforms a statue of a cat into a real one. The cat Tut-Tut is the key that allows her to draw a door on the blackboard that opens and allows the club to travel to the magical worlds. The club members Tut-Tut and Miss Tickle travel to the world where Rick and his owl Ptolemy are waiting for assistance. At some point during the episode Rick will sing a song that is relevant to the episode theme in some way either in subject or word choice. Miss Tickle the club the animals and Rick resolve the problem of the episode and then Miss Tickle Tut-Tut and the club members return to the real world. Rick and Ptolemy usually remain in the magical worlds. At the end of the episode the theme is re-emphasized for the club member who raised or was the subject of the initial theme definition.
