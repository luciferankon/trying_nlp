The five life stories told by former East German citizens incarcerated for attempting to flee the Republic in the GDR who are representing a group of around 72000 ex-convicts are shocking to the core. The subjects speak with extraordinary openness of their struggles with the regime of horrific prison conditions and interrogation methods. This sensitive documentary maintains a close proximity to its protagonists throughout examining open wounds and bringing psychological damage to light that have made it impossible for them to live a normal fear-free lives ever since. A remarkable cinematic contribution that shows five unique facets of a daily life consisting of torture abominations and violations of human dignity without attempting to judge provoke or explain. Rather the film documents and makes an important chapter in German history more palpable in the best possible sense.
