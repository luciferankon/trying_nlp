Coached into Silence is a feature-length documentary which deals with sexual abuse within the world of organized sports. The film tells the stories of a diverse group of young athletes whom the system failed to protect. Far more sinister than those failures of prevention this film will shed light on the organizational institutional and legal systems which have conspired in attempting to silence the victims while protecting profits reputations and in some cases the predators themselves.
