Two friends - Min-gyu a wild-animal vet and Eun-hae a fashion photographer - commiserate with each other when each realizes that the person they love is no longer in love with them. In anger Eun-hae smashes up her boyfriend's car; in frustration Min-gyu breaks glasses and carves up a spider. Min-gyu and Eun-hae each urge the other to be calm to move on to forget about it. Good advice if only they could take it. "Why do humans need love?" these friends ask each other. Can jealousy anger and desire for revenge lead two jilted lovers to embrace what they have? Will someone dream of a giraffe?
