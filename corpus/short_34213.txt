Home. Everybody knows what that is. Nobody knows how to describe. Or rather everyone has its own definition of home. Therefore - The concept of this short movie is in having no concept. I am just expressing a vision an idea that once came to me thence this very vision has been elaborated during half a year into this very form of visual art. But this all doesn't really matter because as you watch it your Conscious or Subconscious perceives whatever and however it perceives and converts it into its own interpretation of the story thus art should not be explained. This video is about global and particular real and abstract. I am in no place to explain to you dear audience what you have just seen.
