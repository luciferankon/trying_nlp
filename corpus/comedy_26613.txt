Young dumb and full of love! is a hilarious comedy about sex love and youth. What happens when a clumsy teenage boy meets the woman of his dreams? A woman who's a little bit older a little bit married and a little bit unfaithful - hey nobody's perfect. But she does exist; you can see her you can touch her sometimes she even seems interested - so you just have to make her yours. Only it's not that simple. Your great plans become great disasters as you try to overcome a jealous husband a nerve-wracking lover a paternalistic janitor a bashful paddle-boat lender and a girl who may deserve a lot more attention than the "dream woman" herself.
