Based on true stories ALLURE is a process-driven film where filmmakers and actors worked together through a series of improvisations to tell the stories of five women in New York who come from five very different countries. Each one struggles to overcome her personal conflict set against the Occupy Wall Street movements of 2011. These stories touch and inform each other and create a larger narrative about gender emigration power class and personal politics.
