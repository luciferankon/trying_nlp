Outside the Wire is an interactive movie where you "play" as the lead characters make decisions for them and experience the consequences of the choices you select. This immersive experience allows viewers to try wartime decision making in the safety of a movie. Based on lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan it mirrors in-combat support operations. You make the pivotal decisions that alter their storyline and outcome. Your fate and the fate of your troops hinge on every decision you make as you proceed through your deployment.
