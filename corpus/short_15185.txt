A capital film showing the acrobatic performances of a celebrated Continental troupe. The performers are one lady and two gentlemen who go through some wonderful ground tumbling lightning somersault throwing and astonishing pyramid acrobatic feats. The lady finishes her performance by throwing fifty somersaults in succession. A tastefully arranged stage and the beautiful dresses of the performers make the film particularly attractive.
