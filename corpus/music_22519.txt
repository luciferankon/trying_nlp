Mengone (tenor) the apothecary's apprentice loves Grilletta (soprano) but Volpino a man-about-town loves her too. Sempronio Grilletta's foster father seems unlikely to allow them to marry as he is interested in her himself. Calling Mengone's bluff to see if he really loves her Grilletta pretends to accept Sempronio (tenor) but the notary who arrives to marry them is actually Volponio in disguise. Mengone also appears also disguised as a notary!
