Porn store owner Pete orders some new stuff from his supplier Niko but Niko mixes up the address with the address of the local Barclays Bank. Here newly-weds David (the bank's assistant manager) and Penny Hunter is shocked when first photos then films and then finally two girls are sent to them in the Bank's flat. They and their friend head cashier Brian Runnicles (who slowly starts to have a nervous breakdown) have to deal with getting rid of the porn without letting their boss Mr. Bromley - the bank's manager (who's very anti-porn) the local police in the form of Inspector Paul and David's mother Bertha Hunter in on what is happening... A mistaken address causes a newlywed couple's apartment to fill up with mail-order Swiss porn...right before a visit by the wife's father a bank president who happens to be the husband's new employer. From the Broadway play. Illegal pornography has been flooding the streets of urban England. Local dealer Pete Hunter whose shop is located at 313 High Street orders some pornographic photographs from his supplier Niko. Niko addressing the package to "P. Hunter" inadvertently sends it to 131 High Street instead. At that address is a Barclay Bank branch upstairs at which is a flat belonging to the bank where bank executive David and his wife Penny just returned from their honeymoon live. Their last name is also Hunter. When the package arrives at 131 David and Penny thinking that the P. Hunter is her are horrified as to its contents not only because of the salacious material but also that David's boss Mr. Bromley has previously fired without question others who possessed such materials. With help from David's bank colleague head cashier Brian Runnicles they try and dispose of the photos before either Mr. Bromley David's visiting mother Bertha or ultimately the police see them. But getting rid of the evidence is more difficult than they expect and Pete Hunter just keeps on ordering more porn which gets delivered to 131.
