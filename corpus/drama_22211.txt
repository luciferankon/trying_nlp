Peter and Maria a newly-married American couple come to a small Swiss village to hire Glooker a famous mountain guide to take them up the east wall of Pitz-Palu one of the highest peaks in the Alps. They meet Dr. Jensen a fellow American whose wife fell to her death on a Pitz-Palu climb twenty years ago to the day. Jensen returns each year on the date of her death in the hope that the ice will yield up her body. He cautions the young couple against attempting the difficult climb especially in the threatening weather and confesses he had failed to heed a similar warning twenty years before when the fatal accident occurred. As dawn breaks Peter leaves the house leaving Maria asleep determined to try the climb alone. Jensen hears him and insists on going. Maria awakes and is determined to share with Peter the adventure and the danger. Together the trio begin the assent waving casually to a band of students (who are later buried in an avalanche). The climbers also have a few problems of their own.
