After Sam a "second year 6th grader" steals her lunch during the first week of middle school Lauren Jeffreys seeks out other victims labeled "Zeros" and forms a support group in her backyard tree house. Meanwhile Sam's father a bow-tie wearing science teacher belittles "Crazy" Carl an unconventionally wise hillbilly janitor as they compete for the affections of a hot new English teacher/volleyball coach. Along the way toilet paper flies mop water splashes and cafeteria food splatters as the Zeros and Mr. Carl clumsily learn the difference between standing up for oneself and fighting back.
