Mary Alden and her brothers Matthew and George have extremely different political views. Matthew is a committed pacifist and is constantly giving speeches against war. George is notified that his draft number 258 has been called and to report for induction but he refuses. Mary on the other hand is intensely patriotic and comes up with a plan to shame him into reporting for induction. Meanwhile Matthew is being set up for a patsy by a gang of German secret agents led by Van Bierman who are planning to blow up an airplane factory.
