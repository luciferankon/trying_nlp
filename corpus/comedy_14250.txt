This stream-of-consciousness live-action comedy is a journey through our hero's to-do list as he tries to escape his everyday life by moving to Japan. Each episode of Frank Leaves For The Orient deals with another aspect of Frank's attempts to wrap up his life break up with his girlfriend quit his job etc. The action becomes a surreal rapid-fire sometimes non-linear story that splits apart and then comes back together.
