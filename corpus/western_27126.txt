On the way El Conejo's men captures Red and is about to be executed but the bandit ever the sport gives Red a chance to defend himself. Red beats El Conejo to the draw without shooting him and then since he is innocent convinces him he will be better off in jail. Red his friends Buckskin Blodgett and Little Beaver his aunt the Duchess and the Marshal's fianc√© Carole Loomis are guarding El Conejo in jail figuring that Hanlon's gang will try to free him since they can't blame raids on him while he is in jail. Carole leaves to go home and finds her uncle Happy Loomis unconscious in the street after having been beaten up. She summons her friends who leave Buckskin as the sole guard in the jail. Hanlon's men overpower Buckskin take El Conejo to a ranch shoot and wound the rancher who sees only El Conejo and then they let El Conejo escape.
