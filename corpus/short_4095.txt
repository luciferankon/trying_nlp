Snapchat-story based drama first of it's kind. Chantelle is young wild and free. We follow her vibrant life through several months of footage. Things radically change however when Chantelle suffers an acid attack on screen. Chantelle is left physically and mentally scarred- but what will she present through her phone? 'Cracked Screen' is a difficult and unique experience. It charts Chantelle's desperate and damaging relationship with social media as we- her community her critics and her audience- watch on carefully.
