Saturday the 15th of November 2002 three days after the grounding of the tanker Prestige the first oil slicks arrive on the Galician coast. During a weekend of gale force winds the local fishermen along with tourists and curious onlookers contemplate the beginning of what would become Europe's worst oil spill. A few days later they would have to go to sea to try and stop the oil from destroying their livelihood. A Galician TV crew witnessed during three months the tireless effort of the people of this coast in blocking and removing the oil slick. Two years later taking with them their original recordings they returned to the coast to find those that had appeared briefly for twenty seconds or so in TV news broadcasts as they tried to avert an ecological disaster with their own hands. 15th of November 2002 the first oil slicks arrive on the Galician coast.Two years later taking with them their original recordings they returned to the coast to find those that had appeared briefly in TV news broadcasts as they tried to avert an ecological disaster with their own hands.
