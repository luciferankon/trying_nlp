In 1984 JÅ™rgen Leth cinematographer Dan Holmberg and sound recordist Niels Torp travelled some 6000 kilometres by train through China. The result is a very calm beautifully perceived travelogue borne by unprejudiced curiosity and observational ability. A riverboat in a landscape of sugar-top mountains in Southern China and the many shots from the train journey are the visual leitmotifs of the film in which we meet an acrobat a painter in inks some opera students from the Beijing conservatory and a group of female racing cyclists. The camera falls in love with exquisite tai chi movements and the dexterity of the train kitchen staff and the soundtrack gives a vivid sense of the noisy life on board with music blaring from scratchy loudspeakers. The fact that the film should be viewed as a collection of notes on film i.e. a kind of travel journal is emphasised by the title and by Leth's only words on the soundtrack: "I take notes because I want to remember what I have seen. I am smoking a Chinese cigarette and I am travelling on board a train in China". (In an English version of the film which is nineteen minutes shorter a further three notes appear on the soundtrack).
