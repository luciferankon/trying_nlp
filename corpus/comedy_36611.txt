It has been a year since Johnny and Wayne created the Ultimate Bra for Samantha's company. Now Johnny and Lena (Wayne's girlfriend) are asked to make the Ultimate Baby product called Mighty Baby. When Johnny and Lena are stumped they turn to Wayne...but Wayne is terrified of babies. To help things out Lena hires Boey an expert on babies to join the team. However Boey and Wayne get closer and Johnny (who had broken up with Samantha) falls for his new secretary the paranoid Sabrina. However they must get the Mighty Baby product done before they can settle their personal affairs.
