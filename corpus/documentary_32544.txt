The film tells the story of Engineer Ivan Ivanov the longest-ruling and most successful mayor of Sofia who was in office in the most turbulent times from 1934 through 1944. During his terms Sofia was known as the "Little Brussels" and the "Vienna of the Balkans". The Mayor is a documentary about the dramatic and extraordinary life of a person who preserved his morals and dignity despite all hardships and vicissitudes he had to endure. However this film is not simply a depiction of the life story of an exceptional character. It also focuses on the role of the individual against the backdrop of major historical events. It delves into the issues of what price has to be paid for withholding one's personal choice and whether it is possible to abide by one's principles in a time when this may turn into an excessive burden.
