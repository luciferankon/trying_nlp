Teaching the Life of Music is a documentary about the transformative power of music. It celebrates the success of Maestro Jose Abreu's mission to bring free music education and instruments to the underprivileged and at-risk youth of Venezuela. His vision and the work of his organization El Sistema have inspired the creation of similar organizations in North America specifically Ottawa's The Leading Note Foundation which has adapted its program to also support young new Canadians. Narrated by Glee's Cory Monteith this documentary will reveal the inspiration and passion that defines El Sistema and music's ability to create social change.
