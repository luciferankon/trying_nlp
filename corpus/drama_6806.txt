In "Love Trap" we meet Richard- a laid-back yet forward-thinking law student- hanging out with the guys at a local pool hall. When Angel- a seductive vixen in a red dress- appears from nowhere and smothers him with attention he finds himself in a situation most guys wish for. Faced with temptation Richard makes a seemingly innocent suggestion that sets in motion a series of events that ultimately unbalances his world. When the dust settles we witness Richard's small but profound epiphany about the true nature of love.
