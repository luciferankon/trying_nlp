Late Flowering lust is a lot more wistful than it is lustful but it is a real gem of a BBC production. It is a reading of a number of John Betjeman's poems by Nigel Hawthorne (Yes Minister) one of which gives its title to the film. However the format is unique. The 'plot' is that 'Cousin John' (Hawthorne) is invited for a weekend at a country house. He and owners of the house are of the older generation and the daughter and all her friends are of the younger one. The action of the film consists of Nigel Hawthorne voicing-over the selected poems while the three older people mime the subject matter of each one and the 'bright young things' (who are a dance troupe - Adventures in Motion Pictures) dance the subject of each one. It doesn't sound like much to describe it as I have you have to see it to realise just how original and creative it is. Very English very amusing and very well done. It was choreographed by Matthew Bourne and the music was composed by Jim Parker. The film was only ever released on VHS so is not available in DVD quality and of course it is a 4:3 aspect ratio.
