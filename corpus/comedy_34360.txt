This comedy series stands halfway between the average sitcom and Tarantinoesque production. It focuses on Curtis a weird couch potato who never leaves his home and watches the Rex Reilly Show (Geraldo on acid) all day long. Also of importance are his room-mates Hope and Nathan and Lucky the cat. To some extent the show might be considered a wild satire of Generation-X life in Toronto.
