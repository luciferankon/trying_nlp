Altitude: 4000 meters. We find ourselves in the Andes Perou. Up there near the clouds where the llamas used to graze brown water springs from the rocks. A teacher and her pupils are sampling the murky liquid in order to analyse it in the school lab. Later from the samples the pupils diligently extract tiny 'bugs'. And where there are bugs there is bound to be life right? Wrong. There is lead. Those invertebrates are a scientific proof that the water is contaminated. But who wants to believe them? Like so many others the survival of the community of Huayhuay depends on the mine.... And while a miner is witness to the upheavals jeopardising his job his own daughter comes to believe that one day things may change.
