After 27 years Paraguay receive a Pope in July 2015. "Ore Ru" tells the history of waiting for this event through the life stories of Gaby a native of one of the poorest neighborhoods of Asuncion; Mafe who fights against a terminal illness; Margarita Aché indigenous fighting for the survival of their culture and tradition; and Tati a survivor of the tragedy of Ycuá Bolańos. The documentary features four different looks that show us how we are and feel the Paraguayans but mostly show how far we get for what we believe.
