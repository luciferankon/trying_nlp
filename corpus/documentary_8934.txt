At a stone quarry above Hebron Arab stonecutters work without explosives to cut away slabs shipped to cities to build houses. We visit a site in an old Arab quarter of Jerusalem where Palestinian laborers are enlarging a house for a Jewish family that had been an Arab family's home until 1948. We meet the house's present owner a Jewish professional. We meet a stonemason at work on the addition; he talks about his hatred of Jews. We meet an older man who had built the original house and we meet the physician who had lived in the house until he and his family evacuated it. He explains why they left. History class labor and attitude on display at a construction site.
