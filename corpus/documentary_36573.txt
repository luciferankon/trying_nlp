How do people spend their time during the daily traffic jams? Standing still in a traffic jam seems an aimless occupation but there appears to be little resistance against daily driving on Holland's congested freeways. Director Michiel van Erp created a portrait of a variety of Dutch people who live and work in their car. The drivers are portrayed among a cacophony of honking and waiting motorists far away from their destination with plenty of time to reflect on their personal lives and works. Are they still on the right track? Stuck offers a moving and revealing insight into the mindset of Dutch men and women from all walks of life. Career coach Titia looks back on her failed relationship with a Senegalese man and clairvoyant Tino Fiorelli contemplates how to deal with his wife's illness. The chauffeur of Alexander Rinnooy Kan-the Dutch Government's top economic advisor-philosophizes on a solution for the traffic jam problem and Turkish satellite dish installer Ziggy Kayabasi fantasizes about returning to his home town Istanbul. Free of spouses colleagues and employers the private world of the personal car seems ideal for inner thoughts and self-counseling. Stuck is a poetic film that provides a unique reflection on a country and its mobile inhabitants.
