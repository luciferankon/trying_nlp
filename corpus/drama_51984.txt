It is the 61st birthday of the American author 'Eugene O'Neill (I)' (qv). He is sick old and his name has started to fade from the public consciousness. His wife 'Carlotta Monterey' (qv) is far from supporting in fact she constantly reminds him of his shortcomings and unfulfilled dreams. Their sons Eugene Jr. and Shane come to congratulate him (and perhaps expecting to get some money). But they are unable to help their father since they have their own problems: Eugene Jr. is an alcoholic Shane is doing drugs.
