Inspired by the passion of an iconoclastic young artist gallery runners Jon and Candy hit upon a scheme to inject interest into their failing gallery - have the artist desecrate valuable works of art (only he'll be ruining fakes instead). Problems arise when two of the "fakes" turn out to be real. The artist is talented enough to replicate passable fakes to replace and "become" the originals but these then mysteriously disappear putting the forgers in trouble. Meanwhile the gallery owners themselves have both fallen in love one with the talented but edgy artist the other with the son of a local gangster who's behind the local film festival of a drag queen running for congress.
