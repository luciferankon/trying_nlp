The percussion festival "Tam Tam" in Alma Quebec filmed from the point of view of mobile toys on a stand selling African objects during a performance of Japanese drumming. The film presents a furtive look at a moment in time of a festival that celebrates multiculturalism and therefore otherness. Quebec itself is in a unique position and is caught up in a struggle between different cultures and cultural influences.
