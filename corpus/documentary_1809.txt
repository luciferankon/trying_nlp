Generation Social is a film about how our inherent social nature drives cultural change and some of the people who drive that change. From culture to social networks to education to business everything is in flux. By profiling those at the forefront of this movement we will explore these very different fields giving the viewer a perspective of the broadly diverse community that makes up the social internet. This journey will take us from Emily Carr University's new Social + Interactive Media Centre to SXSWi one of the biggest interactive conferences in the world with startup HootSuite and finally into the home office of a Dot Com Mogul to explore the secrets to his success. One thing rings true throughout these stories: this new medium is about people the people that matter to them.
