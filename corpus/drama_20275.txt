South-East England 2012. Confidence trickster Marcus Pagitt (Al Carretta) has learnt of the 'Carbon Credits' trading scheme a worldwide corporate carbon offset initiative so grey in legislation even the FSA (Financial Services Authority) are unsure of it's legality as a financial product. Cue the legitimate creation of Carbon Foxes Limited an eco-foundation for the Arts and Environment and a brazen front for the ethically questionable sale of Carbon Credit certificates (practically worthless) as genuine stock options to vulnerable clients. As the FSA close in on the near untraceable boiler room scam Marcus develops ever more ingenious methods to maintain his public presence. In for the steal is his estranged wife 'Tia Maria' Ashbury-Wilson (Freya Parsons) the alpha-female in her 'skulk' of deluded friends and acquaintances. Banned as a company director and deluded with visions of grandeur Tia is faced with the harsh reality of life as Mummy Fox; replacement by a younger version of herself. As the scam implodes a new hierarchy evolves.
