This was Lena Horne's first network TV special. Her songs included Billy Strayhorn's "A Flower is a Lovesome Thing" The Beatles' "Blackbird" "You've Made Me So Very Happy" "Good Morning Starshine" and of course her classic rendition of "Stormy Weather". O.C. Smith sang his song "Friend Lover Woman Wife." David Janssen chatted with Lena about appearing in a string of forgettable movies when he was starting out as a child and in his early twenties then segues into their version of a duet of "I've Been to Town" while photos of David from 6-months-old through high school and beyond are shown. Lena's husband Lennie Hayton conducted the orchestra.
