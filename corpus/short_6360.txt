Bar-Rac is a raccoon that lives in the vicinity of Santa Monica Mountain. Bar-Rac's day usually starts at night as he forages for food for himself and his family less so for the latter to the dismay of Mrs. Bar-Rac. On this night Bar-Rac encounters a bobcat who is more on his trail and the other way around but a skunk unwittingly comes to his rescue. He also encounters what he hopes will be potential meals including a rabbit a squirrel a frog and a dead chicken being used as bait in an animal trap. In another encounter he is scared off by an owl. Some human related items may help Bar-Rac finally get his meal unless that pesky bobcat who just won't go away has a raccoon meal first.
