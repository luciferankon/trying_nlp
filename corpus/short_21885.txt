Based on "A Spider and A Fly" by writer/poet Don Marquis the narrator Archy types a story about self-discovery. In the story-within-a-story the Plodder lives in a world of uninspiring daily routine. Through a dialogue with her inner self she discovers the Artist lives within her. The Plodder and the Artist critique each other with the Artist claiming that the safe routine world of the Plodder is destroying her. Eventually the Plodder has to die for the Artist to be born within her.
