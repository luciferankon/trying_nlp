The voice on wings made people remember. Grandparents sang them for their grandchildren until they had become grandparents; making their stories immortal. Meanwhile mobiles and e-mails have made singing grandparents a rare commodity buying their precious treasure under the crushing weight of commerce and technology. Yet they are still out there: in countries like Ruthenia Basque Country Gaelic Ireland and North Western Iceland. Saving their stories in the rhythm of singing. We happened to be there and switched the camera and microphone on recording the voices on wings before they would be swallowed by the past.
