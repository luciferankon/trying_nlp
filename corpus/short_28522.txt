This ad campaign for Jhonnie Walker's Blue Label explores the possibility of two people being capable of keeping their word in exchange of an experience. Not any experience though but a really unusual one that supposes a journey towards discovery the possibility of going beyond what they know and for them to go out of their comfort zones. With this in mind the people from Prodavinci decided put their collaborators' word to the test and at the same time daring them to experiment. With "Prodavinci: The Gentleman's Wager" the photographer Roberto Mata and the writer Luis Yslas discover a new way to document their realities and one very different from the one they usually use. In that same way the radio host Albani Lozada has to face a poetic dare from storyteller Oscar Marcano to get an interview from him. On the other hand the writer Francisco Suniaga will only agree to reveal his professional secrets to Ramon Pasquier if said radio host dares to dive into the literary world. To conclude Prodavinci becomes the stage for the new confrontation between Héctor and Aquiles; and epic encounter where song meets flavor and something that could only reach its peak of perfection with chef Héctor Romero and maestro Aquiles Báez.
