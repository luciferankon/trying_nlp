Zamindar Virendra Shankar Roy's only son Deepu mended his disobedient ways when Indranath became his teacher. Later Deepu went to Kolkata to complete his higher studies in medicine and thereby fell in love with Indranath's daughter Shanti whom Virendra opposed. He insulted Indranath and Indranath then requested Shanti to marry Kamalesh Mitra. Shanti understanding her father's pain obeyed. Suresh provoked Kamalesh to set up a relationship with Lalita who was involved in the flesh trade. Kamalesh's condition became serious. Deepu did the needful and saved Kamalesh's life. Everything ended with Shanti and Kamalesh re-establishing their relationship once more.
