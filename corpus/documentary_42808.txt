Getting inside Hollywood's elite little nightclub the world famous Viper Room on the Sunset Strip was where it was at in the 1990's. Johnny Depp opened his monumental venue just to have a place to hang out with his friends and play music. The nightclub witnessed a tragedy early on with the death of River Phoenix just outside it's doors. A dark cloud replaced the good times and the local clientele was replaced by tourists toting cameras snapping away at the young star's final resting place. Johnny Depp and Viper Room manager Sal Jenco hired a friend as the club's promoter and V.I.P. Liaison in the mid 1990's to help restore the original feel and bring back the patrons who frequented the place before the night that it all changed. With the help of some old friends she will take you back to the Viper's good old days finding the players who made up this playground of Hollywood Célébrité in the heart of the Sunset Strip. We'll go back to the nightclub's first incarnation in the 1940's when the Melody Room was a notorious hangout for mobsters carrying you through to the birth and the heyday of The Viper Room the intersection where rock 'n' roll and Hollywood converged under one roof! There was no other nightclub like it.
