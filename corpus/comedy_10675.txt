The motion picture comedy Same to You Boss! tells the story of a company owner who wants his firm to fail in an "honest" manner. To ensure that his plan goes off without a hitch he purposely hires people whom he is convinced are totally incompetent. A brilliant idea it seems. That is until they start to become successful... And so begins a grueling battle with an idiot... But who is the idiot?
