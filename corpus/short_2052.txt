The drama / antiwar short film IF ALL KIDS inspired by Yiannis Ritsos' poem "If All Children on Earth" aims to give a punch to xenophobia highlight problems due to lack of education and glorify peace. It deals with violence childhood traumas cultures conflicts manipulation of students by family and the uninspired education system while it is sending universal messages for the reconciliation of the nations and the respect of diversity. All above is achieved by the visual realization of an original story focused on a refugee child from Afghanistan (a country that experienced a 14-year war) and its integration in the demanding German society.
