Under the leadership of newly appointed CEO Clair Freeman Zo√ç International Biotechnologies has become a leader in Nanotech. After years of congressional hearings the military has approved the use of nanotech in US soldiers. Presidential candidate Senator Troy Lakey has been the biggest supporter of the super Soldier program called "Freedoms Front Line" since the terror attack 4 years previously on March 19th. Samson Mosely a former Black Ops soldier was thought to have been killed that horrible day but was in fact the key to Dr. Freeman's program. Now Sam is one of the greatest super soldiers... and is out for revenge. The nanobots inside Samson want to control him... to make him the perfect killing machine. It is up to Sam to determine if he will be that machine or be human.
