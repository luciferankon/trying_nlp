I am an attorney at a large law firm in NYC and have a health condition that I would like to raise awareness for. I would like to raise awareness by doing some sort of art project either a book a song but probably more likely one of those moth monologues or a traveling one man play. I am not a professional artist in any way and certainly compared to whoever is reading this I am not an 'artist' yet but I would like to finally pursue my creative side in making whatever this project ends up being. I will have a lot of issues to deal with in doing this: (1) the health issue itself which affects every single solitary thing in my life (I can explain more details with a confidentiality agreement); (2) doing the project while also making sure I don't blow things at my current job by either doing some sort of ethical violation that gets me disbarred or by scaring away clients (or coworkers) because of my health condition and (3) making sure that I do this whole 'awareness' thing the right way by trying to have the most or best impact that is in line with the consensus thinking about this health condition. Anyway I really need a partner more than funding although I'm sure I'll need funding too. So I guess I need money for all the film and cameras (unless someone I partner with already has them) and then maybe money to pay some assistants (this is why I need a partner). Anyway thanks for reading this and your consideration! Please keep doing what you're doing!
