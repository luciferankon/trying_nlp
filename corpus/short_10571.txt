Of historical note as reported in The Hollywood Reporter The Washington Post (Friday August 9 1991 Style section p.D6) and Entertainment Weekly ("Your Very Own Rating!" Aug. 9 1991) this is the first and to date only home movie awarded a rating by the Motion Picture Association of America. Done as part of an Entertainment Weekly feature on the then-new phenomenon of direct-to-video movies this short video of infant Vincent Thomas Lovece set against the 1960s Ronettes hit "Be My Baby" graphically illustrated that any film could get a rating even if not released to theaters. As the Washington Post story noted "In the most recent ratings bulletin issued by the MPAA 'Home Movie' was officially rated G."
