When the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began Vietnam veterans were especially troubled by the frightening parallels with their own experiences. No Unwounded Soldiers follows a group of Vietnam War veterans and the twin sister of a deceased veteran as they explore through work in drama therapy the ways that war changes those who fight. It shows the persistent ripple effects those changes have on them on their families and on their communities. And it shows that healing is possible especially through the arts. As they work to create an original work of drama this group of veterans explores the universality of war's impact on those who serve and they share their emotional and psychological struggle to find healing after war. Joined in the documentary by two veterans of World War II and a veteran of the Iraq conflict they reach out to help new veterans and the public at large understand the lasting effects of war.
