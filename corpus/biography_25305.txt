A love affair with a man who used supernatural means to make her fall in love with him. 'Spirited' is part of HerStory Malaysia a project keen on creating spaces for women to come together and learn how to share their stories with others using artistic platforms like film-making. This project seeks to collect stories about love sex and desire from Malaysian women with an emphasis on diversity and personal experiences of falling in - and out - of love in a distinctly Malaysian context. Five of the submitted stories have been made into films with the help of established Malaysian women artists in the country and these films has been shown as a traveling film festival around Malaysia in October 2010.
