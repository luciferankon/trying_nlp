Someone once said "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man should never be allowed to house-sit." And Mormon Dog Story illustrates why in a farcical buddy comedy that explores the dark underside of the American pastoral. You could call it "Utah Gothic." The problem is the dog. An irresistible Welsh Pembroke Corgi seems to bring out the neediness in everyone in a small Utah town after he is stolen from a house-sitter. People just have to have him and in that pursuit they tear down the town's fa√ßade of stability and respectability.
