Anna Maria a single woman in her 50s devotes her summer vacation to doing missionary work so that Austria may be brought back to the path of virtue. On her daily pilgrimage through Vienna she goes from door to door carrying a foot-high statue of the Virgin Mary. When her husband an Egyptian Muslim confined to a wheelchair comes home after years of absence her life is turned upside down. A lonely wife has become obsessed with Catholicism (although we find out early on that she was originally married to a now-missing Muslim man). As her loneliness increases so does her religious fervor to the point where she spends her vacation time walking through different (and sometimes dangerous) neighborhoods in a quest to re-convert all of Austria to Catholicism. Carrying her statue of the Virgin Mary and endlessly repeating the rosary she eventually begins to engage in ritualistic physical punishment such as self-flagellation purportedly out of her love for Jesus. But a nagging undercurrent of repressed sexuality and transference looms large in her masochistic behavior and when her Islamic husband returns by surprise we see the real extent of her "Christian" behavior.
