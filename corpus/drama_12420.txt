A coruscating drama based on an award winning novel which explores the troubled relationships between the various members of an English family over a long summer when Eleanor the stroke-afflicted old mother decides to give away her beautiful house in Provence to a New Age Foundation run by an Irish charlatan rather than to her own son and his young family. The story is told from the point-of-view firstly of Robert an eight year old boy then his increasingly drunken father Patrick and also finally Mary his long-suffering mother as they all struggle to come to terms with the loss of something they love desperately but increasingly realize will soon be gone forever. It is both a funny and moving tale of family discord.
