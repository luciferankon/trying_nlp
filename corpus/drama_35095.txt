Unable to travel legally into Europe Buba and Mukela pay a smuggler $1000 each for passage in the back of a panel truck into Algeria where the can easily pass into Spain. En route Buba and Mukela meet Violeta (Aminata Kanta) a teenage girl from Mali who is escaping an arranged marriage with a man she hates. During the trip into Algeria the three begin to have doubts about the smugglers and their fears become reality when they're dumped in the desert fourteen kilometers from their destination.
