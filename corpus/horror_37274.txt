A teenage film crew goes to Blairstown New Jersey to document strange occurrences happening in the backwoods. The townspeople have been hearing a loud piercing scream coming from the woods near their town. Many of the people believe it is a coyote but a few of the locals believe it is the Banshee from the Irish folktales. The film crew sets out to capture whatever animal is making this horrible noise. What they find will shock all of America...the Banshee lives.
