Captain Reggie was a superstar "top gun" in Forces Charon most popular most talented most liked until a personal disaster wipes out everything she ever cared for and began a tumultuous slide into insanity. Now five years later she has clawed her way back to the land of the living as a lowly Captain of the worst freight runs in the oldest ships run by the sleaziest operators. Every one of her crew is an outcast and the mission they are launching on is another ho-hum run. Except Reggie's former insanity has also created a nascent ability to see and understand things no other human can and she is on the edge of knowledge that will alter her universe in radical ways. At the same time scientists in a lab orbiting a black hole are on the verge of a breakthrough that will give them sight into the universe which pre-existed the "Big Bang" and where we came from. Each vision has its own consequence for human existence and a conflict of huge proportion is about to explode.
