Three German provincials are searching for hollywood. So they take the most American values they can picture: an absurdly vast car full of fastfood bottles of oil and camera equipment on the way to California via Route 66. That they never find Hollywood is not the only surprise - on their quest for the American cliches they face unplanned incidents. A documentary drama somewhere between Jackass and Michael Moore between gloating and satire.
