What would happen if three huge Franco-Ontarian flags wandered over the Plains of Abraham in Quebec City during the St. Jean Baptiste celebrations? A young Ontario francophone Andréanne Germain goes in search of an answer. Her idea isn't to provoke Quebecers but to sensitize them to an overlooked reality. The setting she chooses is St. Jean Baptiste formerly a celebration for French Canadians in general but since 1967 the Quebec national holiday. So where do we fit in? is what Andréanne asks of the Quebec nationalists playfully but implying the existence of a third Canadian solitude.
