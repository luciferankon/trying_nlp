Mario (Fernandel) a bumptious sheep-shearer discovers he has a inimtable touch that makes women as well as sheep swoon at his professional caress. He is soon the most sought-after hairdresser in France and is awarded the Legion of Honor. Among the women whose lives are changed by a hairdo(and his "touch") are Renee Devillers his understanding wife; Arlette Poirier a busy demimondaine and Blanchette Brunoy his most appreciative customer who sets up his ritzy establishment.
