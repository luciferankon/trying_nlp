Robert is an art photographer who is totally controlled by his wife Hallie. When they go on vacation in New York they leave their house to their friends Zack and Sophie. When they return they find their house a total mess but Zack and Sophie ask to stay a little longer and they agree. A darkly perverse psychological drama about a man who sublimates his life to those around him and the drastic measures he takes in order to regain the illusion of control. A taut character study set in contemporary Los Angeles.
