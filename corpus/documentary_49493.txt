The documentary El Retrato Postergado explores the relationship in the mid 1970s between Haroldo Pedro Conti one of the most important writers and script-players of Argentina with Roberto Cuervo a young filmmaker. The encounter between both of them coincides with an aesthetic turn in Conti's work: from being a folk writer to a more politically committed one. Roberto starts filming him to make a filmic portrait. The project was interrupted. Conti was kidnapped in 1976 and his destiny remained forever unknown. Roberto Cuervo died in a tragic accident leaving his wife Cristina widow at the age of 25 with Andres their only child. More than 30 years later Andres Cuervo recovers the footage shot by his father and completes the film closing a cycle initiated many years before. El Retrato Postergado is a self-reference documentary. The filmmaker explores his own story trying to rebuild a film interrupted by the tragic disappearance of writer Haroldo Conti.
