Every 30 seconds a U.S. child is being lured and/or abducted into sex trafficking - America's largest and fastest growing crime. More than 230000 U.S. youths a year are raped for profit multiple times a day. Their life expectancy is only 4-7 years! According to the FBI the rescue rate of missing children is 1/2 of 1% - 20% of those in non family abductions are not found alive. With more than 70 foreign as well as local actors and actresses this film educates via entertainment the unique (and sadly effective) tricks and tactics of pimps pedophiles and sex traffickers in order that your loved one will not become a statistic.
