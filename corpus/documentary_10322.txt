Euphoria begins by asking us: in a country built for the pursuit of happiness is it working? Are you happy? Narrator Lee Boot takes us on a journey through the American landscape - the one that surrounds us and the one inside us. As Boot untangles the elements necessary for emotional survival the meaning in our own lives becomes refreshingly tanglible.
