Jack is an Irish ex-cop on the wrong side of forty who has become a finder with a sharp tongue and a soft heart. He takes on the cases The Guards (Irish Police Force) won't touch no matter how hopeless. He's pig stubborn. He defends the lost and the broken. He's good because he looks where no one else looks talks to the people no one else talks to. Moreover he knows every back street in his hometown Galway knows the seed and breed of everyone in it. But small towns have big memories and like Jack they are quick to anger and slow to forgive.
