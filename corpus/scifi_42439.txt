Not everything is what it seems. This is the motto of Fernando PÃ©rez's Madrigal an esoteric fable built in the first part around a handsome actor's love story with an overweight and homely girl (does he have eyes for her or for her swanky apartment?) and in the second part recounting the story of a futuristic novel the actor is writing (which turns Havana into some dark orgyesque playground with a film noir tone).
