Presto Socks Turtle Joe and Figgy were Brooklyn teenagers living in a mostly Italian neighborhood who called themselves the Flatbush Fungos. All were just out of high school and worked full-time jobs. The series chronicled their misadventures at work on the streets with members of the opposite sex and with (and against) the sometimes eccentric members of their neighborhood.
