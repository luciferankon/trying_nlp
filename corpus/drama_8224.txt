ReRUN a feature film currently in production is a modern day twist on "It's A Wonderful Life" where George falls through the closet and ends up in today's world grappling with a more youthful world but with the ageless elements of choice love regret and re-imagining one's life and coming to terms with it. Production for the modern day world is complete and post-production is almost done. In production is the FUTURE part of the film when George is looking back before he falls through the closet and the end of the film when he returns from the that journey.
