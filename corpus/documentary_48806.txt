In 1972 an airplane carrying an Uruguayan rugby team crashed in the Andes Mountains killing many of those on board. After exhausting what little food supply they had the survivors realized that in order to stay alive they would have to eat their dead comrades. In 1993 a film was made of the incident and this documentary recounts some of the making of the film and has interviews with some of the survivors of the original incident.
