Luft Räume is a filmic analysis of fascist geometry. Using the camera as a microscope Schönwieser films the flak bunker in Vienna's "Arena park". There are six sections which run from the bottom to the top between the gunners' passageway on the bunker platform or with a heat-sensitive camera which almost liquefies the concrete. (Michael Palm)
