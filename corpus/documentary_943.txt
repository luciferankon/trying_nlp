While exposing those who profit from human trafficking and exploitation the feature length documentary film "The Sugar Babies: The Plight of the Children of Agricultural Workers in the Sugar Industry of the Dominican Republic" explores the lives of those who live in circumstances that can only be considered modern day slavery.
