Bashful stenographer Bunker Bean ( Jack Pickford ) works for wealthy businessman Jim Breede by day and by night theosophist Prof. Balthasar who convinces Bean that he is the reincarnation of Napoleon and more remotely of the great Egyptian king Ramses. His courage much bolstered by this revelation Bean begins to deport himself with unaccustomed dignity and becomes a regular visitor to old Breede's estate where he successfully courts the boss's daughter ( Louise Huff ) "The Flapper." With his $10000 inheritance Bean invests in a financial venture that nets him millions and purchases the alleged mummy of Ramses from the professor. After his marriage to The Flapper Bean learns that the professor is a charlatan and realizes that it is the belief in one's own strength of character that leads to success.
