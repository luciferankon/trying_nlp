Desperate and dejected -- Diego feels he isn't "Truly living" and must somehow make a move to regain meaning to his life. Reading about the great painter Paul Gauguin Diego emulates the artist and leaves the comfort of his world for a place he can live cheaply and paint full time. His destination -- Juarez Mexico. But dreams can come at a price and Diego is forced to come to terms with what "truly living" means when one has to survive and escape with one's own life.
