Our host Chris Stefanick introduces you to a faith filled group of men and women who know God with certainty on the basis of His works. Each week Stefanick assumes the duties of the people he profiles working alongside crawfish farmers surfers hang glider pilots missionaries to the homeless miracle historians and other faith-filled professionals: average folks overcoming loss and embracing the mystery of life. You'll walk away from Real Life Catholic with more than just a glimpse into unfamiliar territory - pilgrimaging to World Youth Day swimming in cranberries firing rifles at pi≈Ñatas and touring through Na Pali by helicopter for example. If you're like us you'll end up grasping a new appreciation for how faith works beyond our own natural capacity. Don't take our word for it; see it for yourself. Join Chris as he meets some Real Life Catholics.
