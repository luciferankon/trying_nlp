Visibility Poor: Kuala Lumpur is the opening movement or "sonata" portion of an Asian city symphony. This "city sonata" is constructed from observations from my first travel to a Muslim country Malaysia. In August 2007 I presented a solo show of my films a filmmaking workshop and curated several film screenings in Kuala Lumpur at the invitation of the notthatbalai Art Festival . During my stay there the infamous twin towers of the Petronas multi-national oil and gas company dominated the skyline even though their visibility was diminished by the atmospheric conditions which were described in daily weather reports as "visibility: poor." - JCL
