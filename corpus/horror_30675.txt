Laurinho swears he's a happy man at least when he's inside his van or selling meat and cheese pie as he likes to say. Married to the ex-prostitute Cleusa he tries not to take seriously the absurdities he hears every day from his wife and her friend Shirley who practically lives with the couple. Often mugged by Douglas Laurinho doesn't suspect that the gangster is Shirley's nephew. But - Everything can change when Laurinho wins 350 million reais in a lottery - alone. Cleusa and Shirley decide that they'll live in Rio de Janeiro with the money but they don't want Laurinho together - neither together nor alive. The two just don't imagine that the Japanese macumbeira Tomoto already gave magic power to the spirit of Laurinho to incorporate in the Van and take revenge of his tormentors.
