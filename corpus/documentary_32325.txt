PRESIDENTIAL ART features and profiles the contributions and association of Singapore's six heads of state towards the development of Singapore's arts scene. The special provides an introspective and retrospective account on each President's personal involvement in the arts through various interviews with friends family members patrons of the arts and anyone who was affected by the actions of these 6 leaders who made a difference to the enhancement of the arts. The program tackles the passionate issue of the arts from a more personal warm perspective on how these men chose to foster and develop a more artistic side of Singaporeans. Our esteemed Presidents: Mr. Yusof Bin Ishak (1965 -1970) Dr. Benjamin Sheares (1971 - 1981) Mr. Devan Nair (1981 - 1985) Mr. Wee Kim Wee (1985 - 1993) Mr. Ong Teng Cheong (1993 - 1999) Mr. S. R. Nathan (1999 - present) Presidential Art also reconstructs the development period of the local arts scene through the contributions and impact of these six key Singaporean figures. This reflection will serve as a commemoration and tribute to the Presidents whilst showing how far we've come and how much further we have to go to be considered a vibrant arts hub.
