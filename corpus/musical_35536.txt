A former history teacher currently a house painter is broke before the New Year. Faith meets him with the rich man who wants his living room to be painted by 4 o'clock for a hefty pay. The father and his six children begin the heavy task with a song. When all is done the rich man calls that he is going to pay the house painter on the 2nd of January. The father decides to celebrate New Year no matter what. He leads his "hungry army" to the New Year boots reads them fairy tales from the books and gives them guns to shoot which he gives back to the baffled owners without paying. However he sees the children piled up at a meatball maker's shop. Then he takes the whole family to the rich man house and makes a feast with the roast pork of the owner. The joy seems to be complete. In the morning the kids are still sleeping when the painter gets his ladder and leaves for the city.
