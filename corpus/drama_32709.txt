Every day we're faced with the following exercise: to give the world around us a certain cue. To smile to take everything as a joke to laugh out loud or to allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by reality. To be painfully aware of the distance between us and our dreams of the obstacles and the fact that we are alone all the time. Some choose to escape to build their own world with it's own rules with the memories of fairy tales and dreams that really come to be. A world where three friends are brought together by the same destination. Or maybe it all comes down to daydreaming. And feeling the empty spaces with music. It all depends on how you choose to see things. In black in white or in sync with the beat. Billion Star Hotel for each viewer a different story.
