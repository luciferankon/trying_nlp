One day Hilmi comes to his wife Nurten with an unusual request. He is in need of a room that no one else but himself can access. Immediately after Hilmi sets up his "abstract room" and shuts himself off from the outside world. The building's janitor Ilyas is suspicious. He starts questioning Nurten about Hilmi's whereabouts. Time passes by with no sign of Hilmi. As Ilyas is setting the ground for an "intervention" with more and more questions Nurten is convinced that crows have invaded her balcony through a broken window.
