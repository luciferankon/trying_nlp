A Fortunate Soldier... is a documentary that explores the psychological journey of a soldier's life during and after the Apartheid era in Southern Africa. Koos Verwey (fer-VEY) has been a Special Forces Operator for nearly two decades. He abandons his military career aspirations in search of prosperity but unwittingly discovers his humanity. Consequently he finds the need to detach himself from his conservative Afrikaner family but in the process embraces a new one. Koos now lives alongside the indigenous Himba tribe in the remote northern reaches of Namibia with his adopted Angolan daughter Juanine.
