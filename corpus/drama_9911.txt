A rare (for them) German-made film in the Soap Opera genre later mined by German-born Douglas Sirk in a series of plush-and-dreamy American films throughout the 1950's. Here Angelika has an incurable disease but Dr. Holl the fianc√© of Angelika's nurse Helga has discovered a serum that will relieve her pain and fear. Thus relieved Angelika falls in love with Dr. Holl and her only wish is to marry him. Helga seeing that it will mean some degree of happiness for Angelika in her few remaining days gives her consent to this supposedly short-term arrangement. But the good doctor then actually discovers a cure for Angelika's disease and also discovers he has fallen in love with his married-in-pity bride. Alas poor Helga.
