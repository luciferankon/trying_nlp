In this experimental-short director Peter Bolte engages us in an introspective questioning of our current social state. Consisting of images gathered during a car trip from Boston MA to Hastings NE the American landscape in its many incantations is presented compared and contrasted. The industrial wastelands found along the New Jersey Turnpike stand alongside nature's butterfly and eccentricities created by outsider artists. "Rational" structures such as fast-food are juxtaposed against the "irrational" mom-and-pop establishments. Correlations between man and machine also receive treatment.
