Bob a sympathetic young man keeps telling women what they want to hear to get good times. When he is about to marry the daughter of a very well-situated banker her father does a little research on his future son-in-law and finds out the truth about Bob. He then forces Bob to marry his daughter and to be the perfect husband or else... Unfortunately Bob meets "the one" just a few days before the wedding. His problem: He also had told her what she had wanted to hear. His other problem: His future wife does not know yet. His third problem: Two very protective brothers of one of his past affairs are after him to take revenge for him taking her virginity - and the Turks are very sincere when it comes to a little virginity.
