Vikram is a remarkable driver who is able to do the incredible in just ten seconds. He is a complete stranger that his name remains unknown even to his close associates. As he is a transporter he prefers to introduce himself with different names like James Bond Kamal Haasan Mani Ratnam. When Vikram meets Shakeela (Samantha) his life turns upside down as she is wanted by the most deadly terrorists in Uttarkhand. Why are they in search for her? Will Vikram save her life? We have a 'Man with no name' with singular skills in driving which he puts to do good use tying up with a hitman. He is also an instructor at a driving school. When one of his contract jobs involve moving an SUV from Chennai to Mussoorie (with a beloved student from his school for company) he gets on a trip which gives enough adventures and questions to ponder for the adrenaline junkie!
