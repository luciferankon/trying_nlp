Using the methods of digitalization the TV documentary "Persepolis a Glimpse of an Empire" rebuilds Persepolis at the time of the Achaemenid Empire. From the first reconstruction of the "Residential Part" (the Museum today) by Friedrich Krefter and Ernst Herzfeld until now when architects Kourosh Afhami and Wolfgang Gambke use computer technology for its virtual reconstruction. The computer generated images based primarily on Krefter's work "Persepolis-Rekonstruktionen" and the documentation obtained from the excavations led by E.F. Schmidt along with their own recent on-site research results. In addition this virtual reconstruction examines color schemes for the first time which may provide a forum for discussions. The film briefly explores the methodology of this digital reconstruction and its sources using novel pictures and HDTV technology to rebuild a possible version of the original Persepolis. In addition it also presents the role of Persepolis in modern day Iran especially with respect to the Norouz celebrations.
