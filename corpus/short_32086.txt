Three students The Student a young boy enlisted in the British Army The Tommy a follower who fights for adventure and The Lieutenant who fought for his country. These boys were send to the Somme to fight the bloodiest war in British history. Most of the film took place in the first phrase of the war. Soon they realised that war is terrible and one by one they began to fall. In the end we are seen the men charing to their graves. The film focus on the first phrase of the Battle of The Somme only. It will not include the entire battle of Delville wood but the battle of Bazentin Ridge towards the end of the film and the previous battles of the offensive. Our film will not only focus on battle but we will also focus on the horrors of the war how a soldier suffers from shell shock and diseases. Nearing the endthe story is essentially told as a "reflection" on the events that took place earlier the student is interviewed by the British officer. The story is divided into three parts. The first part of the reflection is recollection of the student's time during their holiday with the Lieutenant and the Tommy. The second part focus more on the thoughts of the Student on the first day of the Somme. The final part focuses on the Battle of Bazentin Ridge and how the 100th Brigade tries to survive near Delville wood.
