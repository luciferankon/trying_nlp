Ta'ziyeh is an indigenous form of theater in Iran (also called "passion plays") that until now has never been to America. The Troupe is a documentary about a Ta'ziyeh troupe's journey from Iran to New York's Lincoln Center where they reunite with their director Mohammad Ghaffari after 23 years and set upon mounting three "Ta'ziyehs" for an American audience.
