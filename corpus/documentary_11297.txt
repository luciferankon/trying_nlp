Through a combination of interviews with academic experts and personal immigration stories Pathways will educate viewers on the current state of the immigration system and will clean up the many false myths surrounding the topic. The stories of these incredibly brave and driven kids and their families are really the story of America and our humanity - the relentless pursuit of a better life. By weaving expert insight to support the cause and effect situations our featured subjects find themselves in we hope to not only make an emotional plea for immigration reform but also a fact- based one.
