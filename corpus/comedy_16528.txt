A comedy series about straight-laced Bob and his hard-ass brother-in-law Vargas. Broke-ass Vargas gets an early release from the Big House and moves into Bob and Samantha's little-ass-LA-house. With Vargas offering no assistance with the mortgage payment and sleeping on the couch Bob can do nothing but help Vargas acclimate to "life on the outside" but Vargas has a hard time leaving his hardened ways behind. In the process Vargas teaches Bob some lessons in gaining self-respect - prison style.
