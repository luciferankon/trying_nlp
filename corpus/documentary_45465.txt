Sarasota Half in Dream is a Surrealist documentary specializing in small iridescent impressions of a tropical city and its secrets. The filmmakers shot their explorations into the abandoned golf courses factories and resorts of Sarasota Florida and spoke to local youths who are using them for new and strange purposes. What would the Surrealists and Situationists think of a suburban subtropical tourist town? What goes on in a storage unit in the dead of night? What is the afterlife of a decommissioned train car? What ghosts haunt a ruined hotel? What is the life cycle of a city? When will waters wash it all away?
