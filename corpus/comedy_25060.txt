Rabbit lives in the country with his three children: Peter Lucy and Emily. He is a very cunning guy who's always looking forward to getting into tight situations with his childhood friend Terraspin. The next thing Rabbit knows is that he has a new next-door neighbor. He is with open arms _until_ he discovers his next-door neighbor's a wolf (who's named Wolf) especially one who does not like him. But to his surprise his daughter Lucy likes Wolf's children and they like her. He thinks this is a trap and tells her she can't hang out with them while Wolf is telling his couch-potato sons Barry and Simon they should hunt rabbits not be friends with them. His sons however rather sit around eatting pizza and watching tv.
