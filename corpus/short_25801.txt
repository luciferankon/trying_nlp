WHAT IF...? is about a tragedy that doesn't happen. Fourteen-year-old Alison Pope taking advantage of being home alone dances around her house in anticipation of a later recital entirely lost in her imagination. Her fantasy is interrupted by a stranger who comes to the door and before she knows it is dragging her through her backyard towards his van. Next door Kyle Boot (15) has just come home from school to a empty house and a "work note" from his father outlining a task he must complete as part of his chores. Kyle sees Alison being dragged though her yard. He decides against intervening but finds himself sprinting toward her. He frees Alison by throwing a geode rock at the assailant's head. The new sense of power he experiences is so seductive it overtakes him causing him to be in jeopardy of killing Alison's would-be kidnapper. But just in time Alison intervenes preventing a murder as the authorities arrive on the scene.
