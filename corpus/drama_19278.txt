The title to this underrated follow-up to director PÃ©cas "I Am A Nymphomaniac" seems to mislead people into thinking this film doesn't deliver the eurosex goods. It does! For me personally this film is much more exciting and the better of the two! Sultry Sandra Julien stars as a teenage virgin who is traumatized after being raped by her 2 "friends" a young man and his sister leaving her with no interest in sex. Discouraged she embarks on a journey of sexual awakening in hopes of curing herself. The US version distributed by Radley Metzger's Audobon Productions as "Let Me Love You" is considerably longer then the European version and includes a more effective score recycled from "Camille 2000". The sexy but virginal daughter of the gardener living on a large estate is initiated by force by the owner's incestuous son and daughter. When she embarks on a romance with a theatre director she finds that the trauma resulting from the event has left her frigid. She then tries orgies and prostitution until a psychiatrist helps her overcome her problem by confronting her past.
