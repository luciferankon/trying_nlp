Pirate captain Eksteroog ('foot corn') and his loyal giant camp on a deserted island to search for the legendary treasure of captain Zilvertand ('silver tooth'). Actually they delegated the digging and jungle-searching to shipwrecked presumably orphaned sibling kids whose beloved dog Smikkel is kept hostage. By accident Piet Piraat and his mates arrive on the island. The scary pants stumble upon Silver Tooth's corps and the children who explain and are promised help. That proves perilous as Eksetroog tricks and captures them.
