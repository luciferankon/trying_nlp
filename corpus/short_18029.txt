A fairly dark room. small and discreet. Four players a dealer poker table cards and chips. Everybody continues to study each other's expression looking for the slightest sign they could find placing their bets. Tension was felt between two players in the room. History lies between them both. Ben and Jack. Jack being the most 'powerful' one has his lady Mia beside him watching him play. Ben by himself like the rest of the players he's the most relaxed one in the table. Ben keeps winning. On the last hand Jack having double pairs goes all-in to take Ben off but Ben called the raise as he has the straight with him. The money was all he has too he was confident of the cards in his hands. So again Ben wins over Jack it was a big sum of money. Jack got furious handed over a gun to his lady. She stood up and walks towards Jack and points the gun on his head. He slowly stood up and whispers to Mia kisses her while looking over to Jack with all the satisfaction that he has. As she lowers her hand Ben reaches it to grab the gun. This time it was Ben pointing the gun at her head.
