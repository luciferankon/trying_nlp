It is a story about a woman with a desperate desire to escape reality and fly away. But she only has 8 minutes that is all she can afford. And in a very moment when the artificial sun lamps switch off she has to go back to reality. First to a cheap sun-bed then to everyday life with sleet traffic jams and stress - ultimately back into the daily routine. The brief escape is over but only until the next moment of weakness.
