Jackass meets Spinal Tap. A young comedian/actor goes into bars around Los Angeles and asks people to fight him so he can film the fights and make it into a movie. But he's not much of a fighter so he loses most of the fights but makes a hell of a movie along the way. Complete with girls going wild dwarf tossing and assorted real L.A. characters playing themselves. It's "reality meets insanity" and goes waaay beyond Reality TV.
