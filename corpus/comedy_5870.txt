The day starts off as any normal day on Roach's farm where Teddy the farmhouse dog is doing more productive work than everyone else combined. But the day changes when Roach's farmhand sees an opportunity to be the knight in shining armor to Louise Roach's daughter who he wants to marry. Roach however will not have his daughter marry a lowly farmhand although Louise loves the farmhand. It's also rent day and their landlord - the mortgage holder of the farm - is making his rounds to collect the moneys. He uses his position of power to garner sexual favors from women in return for non-eviction. Having never met Louise the landlord immediately falls in love with her who he too wants to marry. Louise hatches a plan to throw off the landlord's unwanted advances. That plan has unintended consequences. Add to the mix Louise's fear of mice the landlord intercepting an important letter to Roach a collar salesman and his missing infant son and it becomes unclear who Roach will allow marry his daughter and if she will get married at all. The village landlord intimidates women first a faithful wife rescued by the return of her husband then the daughter of a farmer behind on the rent. Dad wants his daughter Louise to marry the landlord so she invents a past affair using an advert photo. The farmer's hired hand likes Louise but will he still when he learns of her putative lover? Things get more complicated when he landlord finds out that Louise is inheriting $100000 and when the man in the advert shows up looking for a baby. Is there a wedding in Louise's future? With whom?
