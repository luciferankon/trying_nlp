When a shy girl secretly in love with her rocker-grrl housemate meets an unbalanced heiress on the run anything could (and does) happen in BRUSHFIRES the latest production from Chicago-based film group Split Pillow. As the three women negotiate the dangerous relationships among them the seven women directors weave a sensual tale of suspense. Drawing inspiration from the poem by Jessica Wilbur and the surrealist parlour game The Exquisite Corpse each director selected a word or phrase on which to base her segment and the seven chapters of the film bear their individual marks. This impressive experiment in filmmaking emerges as a sensitive tale of young desire loss and love's confusion.
