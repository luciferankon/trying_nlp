Distant Vision is a Live Cinema production that was broadcast to a limited audience from the stages of Oklahoma City Community College on June 5 2015. This proof of concept piece was a workshop for a richer more in-depth future live broadcast that will recount the struggles and triumphs of three generations of an Italian-American family set against the birth and growth of the invention of television.
