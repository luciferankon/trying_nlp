Ten Trees is an insightful idea that spurred another broader idea. Fleischner made a documentary about trees. Then he built a theater using the wood from the same trees in which an audience can view the film. This kind of interactive cozy experience - the wood's sweet smell the open ceiling and the damp wooden cubes used for sitting - transports you to the forest.
