The governess takes the little girl for a walk. While sitting on the water's edge the little girl walks away to the hot-house where she falls asleep. As soon as the governess misses her little charge she gives an alarm. Father and mother and all the servants start on a search. A colored man who stole chickens which he carries in a sack is approached. Thinking his theft has been discovered he runs away and is chased by the crowd and cornered. When the chickens are found he is given a good trouncing. A fat colored woman does not fare any better. Two tramps who stole a dog meet a like fate. When the searching party gives up all hope the gardener discovers the little girl asleep in the hothouse and carries her back to the arms of the delighted parents.
