The film is composed around a violent incident happened in 1956. Upon hearing the news that the Russians were approaching the dwellers of the Home for the Disabled armed themselves. Followed by stares by people living in the area they marched along Hermina road or went in wheelchairs on crutches hobbling dragging rifles and a heavy machine-gun. Then they set up firing positions in their gardens and in the windows of their houses. It was night time when the Russian tanks arrived in the parkland. In the attack the tanks destroyed the garden and the people in it leaving behind them gaping holes where windows were before. This is a story about the time before and after the disasters and about the series of these disastrous events.
