A film documentary recording the personal journey of five actors as they explore their childhood memory. This drama workshop is designed as a preparation for later filming of the three films in the series. The films are inspired by former psychoanalyst Alice Miller. In her book 'The Drama Of Being A Child' she argues that many children lose their ability to express their 'true self'.
