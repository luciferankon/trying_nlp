This film charts the remarkable story of Swindon from its "Wild West" beginnings - following Brunel and Gooch's decision to site a factory in open fields below a tiny market town - to the fastest growing town in Europe including how it almost failed at the outset and the initiative of the people that saved it. The tale is woven from expert accounts and fascinating archive film as well as recent footage much of it never seen before. .
