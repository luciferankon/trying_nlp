This February history will be made when 216 women from across the country compete in the inaugural season of the national AFL Women's Competition. They are teachers nurses mums and professionals their dads were footy champions and they played with their brothers growing up but until now they have been denied the chance to play Australia's much-loved game at the highest level. Now the inaugural members of the Crows AFL Women's team have the opportunity to display their passion for the sport on the playing field as part of an elite competition. We go behind the scenes as the team is developed and hear from players and the senior coach as they share their hopes fears and the challenges associated with preparing themselves for the historic first season. The physicality injuries the mental strength and the sacrifices they have made - these women are Everyday Heroes.
