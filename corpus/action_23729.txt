In 2005 Guadalajara was born. The project soon was called off (due to cast disputes) after only 17 scenes of film. They have all come back to bring you this DVD. Guadalajara entails what a young man ('Cody Burns' (qv)) will do to chase down the kidnapper of his little sister. Cody delegates the help of his best friend ('Chris Rex' (qv)) and they chase the villain down to his hideout in a mystical third reality known as the Guadalajara project. Chris's older sister ('Brittany Warner (I)' (qv)) sneaks along and helps the two on their quest to save Cody's sister.
