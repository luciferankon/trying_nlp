A lowly BBC employee pulls a prank at the studio and finds himself transferred to an isolated island where he is to set up a weather station at a lighthouse. As if in a fantasy a ship carrying a bevy of beautiful models is shipwrecked off the coast and the models wind up on the island. However when the models begin disappearing the "back-room boy" investigates and finds a sinister scheme involving spies and Nazi battleships.
