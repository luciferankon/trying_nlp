One of several "slow TV" programmes shown on BBC Four in which a vehicle travels on a slow and leisurely journey through the countryside. In this case the journey is by bus through North Yorkshire from Richmond in Swaledale via the Buttertubs pass Hawes in Wensleydale to Ribblehead Viaduct in Ribblesdale. There was no commentary and only occasional sounds of nearby cows sheep and passing cars.
