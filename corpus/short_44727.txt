Comprised of images of Brooklyn New York Hamilton Ontario and the roadways that connect these two cities the film is a rumination on places we call home. It explores the complexities of coming and going and the loss experienced when trying to return. The experimental form and aesthetic of the film is in part an homage to my filmmaker friend Diane Bonder.
