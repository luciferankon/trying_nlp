4 backpacks full of clothes cameras hopes and excitement. 1 backpack full of experience motivation wisdom optimism and faith. A car filled with tools lights and fuel. And they began. Not knowing where they were heading not knowing what was coming their way only aware of a voice inside them - let us do this. A sacrifice of comfort money energy and time to unravel the deeper contexts of the tales of India - a nation so vast that no one had dared to travel its stretch and spread in one go before this. Days ensued and so did aspirations. They saw more than they could reminisce and understood more than they could comprehend. They heard stories that came through centuries and would go on for generations. They found that they were not a part of India but that India was a part of their very existence. 50 days. 19000 kms. Countless stories. One film. Rediscovering India.
