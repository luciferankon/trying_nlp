Busking is the practice of performing in public places for tips and gratuities. People engaging in this practice are called buskers or street performers. Buskers is a one-hour hosted series that goes around the world past the boardwalks and cityscapes to find out who these people are and what motivates them to live out their lives on the streets of the world.
