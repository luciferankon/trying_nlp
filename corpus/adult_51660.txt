Eight mildly-connected stories of or around a group of well-endowed naval lieutenants are told: (1) Mike (Henson) awakens decides to skip school and knot one off before heading out. (2) A sore-assed paperboy recounts his vigorous sexual manhandling by a overly well-endowed customer. (3) John (Davenport) gives his civilian buddy (Chris) a shooting lesson in firearms; but aroused by the power at their fingertips both head back to John's apartment to fire their "other" guns. (4) MIke and John D stop at a motel where Mike bets he can nail the lad swimming in the pool. Taking along a video transmitter to prove it Mike claiming he's the hotel masseur responding to a paid-for order pays a call on the kid while his parents are away. The naive kid nervously lets Mike in and receives his first massage (and first all-male sexual experience) as John watches everthing on his military issue monitor. (5) With a new credit card in hand Mike picks up two friends from the base (Mike Ryan Jeff Boote) for a Palm Springs trip. Staying over in a nice hotel suite Jeff espies Mike's "Fundies" (two-person underwear purchased to share with his girlfriend). A dare is made and horseplay ensues (wrestling and tickling) winding down into some 3-man sexual explorations. (6) At a bar Lieutenants Henson and Davenport discover that the kid Mike seduced at the motel is none other than the admiral's son. Lieutenant Armano reminds Mike about tomorrow's survival game. (7) Lieutenant Quinn after seeing Lieutenant Rocklin rejected by a bar pick-up decides to give his buddy a well-needed introduction to erogenous zones but his lesson soon turns into a full-on erotic seduction. (8) Lieutenants Mike (Henson) Jeff (Quinn) and Rocky play a survivor paintball game agreeing that whoever loses gets stripped and strung up for the night. Since Rocky is the admiral's arrogant favorite Mike and Jeff form an alliance to guarantee that it's he who'll get hung for the night like a smokehouse ham.
