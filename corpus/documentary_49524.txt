Rock n Roll Outlaw is a documentary profile of Myles Connor. Myles Connor was perhaps Boston's first rock star. He performed with the likes of Johnny Cash Roy Orbison The Beach Boys and many more. He was one of the first rockers in New England to land a record deal. His concerts featured wild theatrics; such as riding a motorcycle up onto the stage and popping out of a closed casket to begin a set. Myles Connor also became one of America's most notorious criminals. He broke out of prison using a soap gun and was involved in a roof-top gun battle in Boston's Back Bay in which he was shot 4 times. He masterminded over 30 museum heists while maintaining a career as a popular Rock n Roll singer. He was framed for murder and later exonerated and spent 20 years of his life in prison for crimes he did and did not commit. Rock n Roll Outlaw contains over 50 interviews and extensive archival visual assets such as newspaper headlines advertisements photographs and film and video footage. Key story elements such as vintage concert sequences gun battle and jail break sequences and many other story arcs were reenacted. The soundtrack consists entirely of recording chronicling Myles' music career. The story's final act is a stunner! We follow Myles Connor into the recording studio as he creates his first music in over 40 years and attempts to redeem his reputation through rock n roll.
