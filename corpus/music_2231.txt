Play - The DVD has eight live tracks recorded on Jools Holland's TV show in England and 10 videos of songs from Moby's album Play. Five of the videos have never been released in America: "Find My Baby" "Porcelain UK" "Bodyrock UK (Fire)" "Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?" and "Natural Blues (Animated)." A 90-minute megamix accompanied by psychedelic visuals showcases the Play remixes used for singles. An interactive function allows fans to remix Moby's songs themselves. Also features a 20-minute home movie "Give an Idiot a Camcorder" in which Moby captures behind-the-scenes footage while touring the world to promote Play.
