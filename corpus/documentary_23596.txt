'are the green fields gone?' tells the story of four creative wanderers travelling across the Pacific Ocean on the maiden voyage a shipping vessel. They paint compose music write and chiefly make the documentary itself. Outside the glorious ocean and dramatic sunsets are challenged by rough seas strong winds and dangerous storms. Inside within the confined space of the interior the crew thrives through their unity and understanding of this strange metal island that they exist within.
