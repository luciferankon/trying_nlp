Early on Malcolm had the dubious pleasure of meeting CLARIDA FORTUNE a bombastic and highly delusional African-American stand-up comedian who considers herself the best undiscovered race comic around. In truth her income comes less from comedy and more from her lucrative trade as a visa sponsor for those like Malcolm desperate to get work papers for the US but once you are beholden to Claridia there's no telling what she will have you do. Though Malcolm hasn't acted since a disastrous stint on General Hospital in 2005 he still has a manager. DAVE McCARTHY ex-stunt-double for Kathleen Turner moved into management after a nasty fall while filming Romancing The Stone. David is an utter narcissist with an eye for the ladies and a razor-sharp instinct to look out for No.1 even stealing jobs from clients for himself. Malcolm's one anchor is his intern DAVON WRIGHT a law undergraduate with an unfathomably good head for numbers and accounting. While Davon is able to support Malcolm in keeping his business afloat he is also able to work it so that this non-paying internship pays in the end. For Davon the house always wins and he is the Bellagio.
