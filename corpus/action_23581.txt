The story of Virtuous Acts written and directed by Stewart Thomas takes place in an alternate New York City. This NYC has been overrun with drugs and violence and is completely dominated by the corrupt hold of Senator Richard Sawtooth (Patrick Martin) and Director of Urban Planning Jack Dragon (Stewart Thomas). The movie focuses on the attempt of Leo Justice (Kwame Feaster) and Isaac Crane (James Lewis) to break the grips of these two madmen and return New York City to its normal beautiful self.
