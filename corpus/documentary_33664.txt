Will there come a point when our brain stops thinking without a computer? When we consider digital sex better than the real thing? And turn our body into a machine? We are living in the midst of an upheaval that could be more radical than anything our parents or grandparents ever experienced. But what does it all mean for us as human beings? In seven episodes the protagonist Helen Fares goes on a journey through futuristic technologies. She meets virtual friends learns to steer a drone with her brain and to hack her own DNA. Encounters with experts in the US Japan and Britan provide context to the posed question: Are we evolving into a new species - the Homo Digitalis? Simultaneously Homo Digitalis is a scientific experiment. In a playful test either as chatbot or as website the user can find out his or her personal future.
