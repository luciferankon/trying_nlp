In this regionally popular series of comedy sketches the mayor of a small town in Southeastern Germany and his townhall messenger meet in the mayor's old-fashioned office and discuss events of global local or office importance in Swabian dialect. When the going gets rough they share a schnaps or two. Occasionally they sing a ditty. In intervals the Oompah band covers international hits in Swabian interpretation.
