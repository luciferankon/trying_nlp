This comedy format on Sunday in prime-time hence -and teasingly- entitled "Tomorrow Monday" was a deliberately in part unpredictable mix of talk show sketches and interaction with the Flemish public at large including mass-dares (one caused a monumental motorway queue) and its own printed weekly magazine. Its fictitious character Xavier De Baere the so-called "professional Goodbye-sayer" ended each episode in a rattling flood of pseudo-eloquent semi-gibberish drowned in exaggeration repetition and various elaborate nonsense fitting his nerdy wrong-size jersey.
