A schlub has a four-year-old son an ex three dishonest photos on Tindr and a litany of shattered dreams to his stupid name which is Hilary. Hilary works for the Ministry of Defence; a minor (and deeply petty) office misunderstanding turns him from a loser into public enemy number one. He stays alive by pretending to be a kind of Edward Snowden whistleblower. The only problem is Hilary doesn't actually have any information to leak. He doesn't know anything. About anything.
