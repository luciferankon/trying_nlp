Cat Swallows Parakeet and Speaks! Ileana Pietrobruno's triumph of mid-vaginal modernism masterfully confronts the surreal nature of societal attitudes towards the female body. Beautifully shot at Riverview Hospital (formerly an insane asylum) the film follows the journey of Scheherazade a young model attempting to insulate herself from paternalistic and sinister medicalization throught the re-telling of tabloid tales. Replete with lesbians anorexics necrophillic undertones and a deluge of menstrual blood Pietrobruno's febrile fable contains enough raw passion to ignite the sensiblities of even the most faded feminists.
