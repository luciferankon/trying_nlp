The scene opens on a theatrical stage. The magician enters from the wings and making a bow to the audience removes his coat and hat and they disappear mysteriously in the air. He then takes a white handkerchief from his pocket holds it over his knees and his long trousers disappear and behold! he is clad in knickerbockers. He next makes a pass with a magic wand and a table suddenly appears before the audience on which is a large pile of tissue paper. The magician takes up the paper and shakes it a few times and three live geese fly out upon the floor. This is a highly pleasing and mystifying subject.
