More than 1200 dwarfs gather every year when Little People of America holds its national convention. In the 50 years since its inception LPA has given its 6000 members a sense of identity and purpose helping them cope in a world in which the confining stereotypes of sideshow attraction persist. Contrasting scenes from their daily lives with the activities of the convention week the film provides insight into the lives of dwarfs and offers a unique and sometimes disturbing perspective on the average-sized world.
