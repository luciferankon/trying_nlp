'My Dying Day' is a deeply emotional yet optimistic look at an individual fighting against all odds to overcome his incurable sickness. Emotional and powerful scenes of the main subject planning out his own funeral plotting his grave site and comforting those who also live in Hospice care blend together with in-depth and personal interviews to help better describe the thin line which divides life and death.
