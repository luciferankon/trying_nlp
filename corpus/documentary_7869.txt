At the beginning of World War II Dave Tatsuno and his family along with 120000 other men women and children of Japanese ancestry were forcibly relocated from their homes to ten remote and desolate imprisonment camps in the interior of the United States. Dave with the help of a camp official smuggled his 8mm film camera into the camp in Topaz Utah and for three years documented his life behind barbed wire. These home movies eventually became TOPAZ MEMORIES the only full color film of the Japanese American internment experience shot by an internee and in 1996 the film was accepted to The Library of Congress National Film Registry. To date it is one of only two home movies held by the Library of Congress - the other being the Zapruder film of the J.F.K. assassination. DAVE TATSUNO MOVIES AND MEMORIES tells the amazing life story of this inspiring individual.
