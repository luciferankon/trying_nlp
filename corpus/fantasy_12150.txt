Hari Bhakt Prahlad is devoted to Bhagwan Vishnu and nothing will distract him from this devotion. When the kingdom's emperor Lord HiranyaKashyap finds out that his subject is engrossed in worshiping someone else he has him summoned and asks him to forget Bhagwan Vishnu and instead worship him. Prahlad refuses to do so and HiranyaKashyap orders that he be admitted in a school and taught to worship him. Prahlad does attend this school and manages to get everyone there to also worship Bhagwan Vishnu thus angering HiranyaKashyap even more. HiranyaKashyap then decides to kill Prahlad his family and all of Bhagwan Vishnu's worshipers with Prahlad being selected to be burnt alive. Now only a miracle from Bhagwan Vishnu can save young Prahlad from being burnt alive. This movie also depicts other avatars of Bhagwan Vishnu as Bhagwan Parsuram; then as Bhagwan Ram; and subsequently as Bhagwan Kishan. It is prophesied that Bhagwan Vishnu will appear as Bhagwan Kalki to end the present Kalyug (dark age).
