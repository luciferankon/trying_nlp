A film poem; a zither plays. A woman lies naked in bed. A man removes his clothes joins her and they kiss. Images fill the frame at first still lifes of common objects: a door knob glasses a cactus a lamp. Then simple actions: a drawer pulled out a letter mailed. On the soundtrack with the music the man and woman comment about mundane things - unconnected phrases. The actions on screen slowly become more rapid and forceful: a bird in a cage flitting about water boiling a drill bit biting into wood; the dialogue has stopped. Sheets on a line blow in the wind; a subway train shoots by. The images slow. Voices of the man and woman off-screen return. We see them lying side by side.
