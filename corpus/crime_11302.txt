On August 28 2003 in the suburbs of Erie Pennsylvania a pizza delivery man named Brian Wells was accosted by several men who locked an explosive device around his neck. They then ordered him to rob a bank. After delivering the money he would receive clues to help him disarm the bomb. It was one of the most ingenious bank robbery schemes in history known as Collarbomb by the FBI. It did not go according to plan. Wells picked up by police shortly after the robbery never found the clues he needed in order to disarm the bomb around his neck. He died before the bomb squad could arrive but after the national news was on the scene. Sadly his death was on live TV. Investigating the crime after his grisly death the FBI soon discovered that Wells was not in fact an innocent victim. He was merely the first co-conspirator to fall in a bizarre trail of death following the crime.
