This Russian-set story starting in 1975 and offering a glimpse of a glamorous and extraordinarily wealthy life in contemporary and near future Russia offers a gritty portrayal of a society in flux where great change and wealth is possible whilst exposing dark undercurrents on an epic scale. The two protagonists meet as children and the story unfolds as a revenge-tragedy.
