This feature length documentary tells the story of 1970's punk band The Gears - in their own words. Rising as young boys and friends in North East Los Angeles these musicians self styled an infectious brand of surf/rockabilly/punk which they still play today. "Don't Be Afraid To Pogo" chronicles singer Axxel G. Reese and The Gears' history in amazing detail while allowing their stream-of-consciousness interviews to play out. Great archival footage and photos of this overlooked band includes a wide variety of neighborhood contributors along the way- a rare event in the rock doc genre. Interviews with Freddie Cannon (Legendary rock singer) Mike Watt (Minutemen) Johnny Stingray (The Controllers/Kaos) Billy Bones (The Skulls) Steve Metz (Mad Society) Miss Mercy (GTO's) and East L.A. born artist Richard Duardo and watch for snippets of animation from low brow genius Kalynn Campbell. Heartfelt and respectful.
