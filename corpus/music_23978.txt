A music and dance film without narration about wedding music in Bulgaria. This genre of music which is both traditional and modern is a furious cocktail of Balkan folk music combined with elements of jazz and rock 'n' roll driven by rhythms of breathtaking complexity. Although it is called "wedding music" it is played at all manner of festive occasions. Filmed at Gypsy weddings and other celebrations in villages in northern Bulgaria "The Wedding Musicians" features the popular clarinet virtuoso Philip "Fekata" Simeonov with his electric Gypsy band "Trustenkk" (accordeon saxophone kaval rhythm guitars percussion) with vocals by Yordan "Dancho" Panov. Made by the filmmakers whose feature-length film about the legendary American mouth organist Larry Adler "Larry - My Life and Music" was selected by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences as "one of the outstanding documentaries of 1993".
