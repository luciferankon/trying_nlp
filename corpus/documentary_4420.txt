An ITV documentary which interviews people whose plastic surgery operations have gone horribly wrong. For the first time cameras capture a "trout pout" as it happens as Emma Jones has an ellergic reaction to lip enhancement. The programme also features a rare interview with Lynne Perrie the actress who had lip implants in 1994 and due to the unflattering look was largely ridiculed by the media.
