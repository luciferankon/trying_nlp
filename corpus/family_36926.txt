A road trip with your best friends - the ultimate way to spend your holidays! That's certainly what Bobby Shannon and the gang thought when they set off on an adventure of a lifetime. But when their truck breaks down in the middle of night in the middle of nowhere without phone signal they have no option to but to seek refuge in a creepy old mansion. Welcomed to spend the night by the brother and sister who live alone in the old house - very strange things begin to occur! As the local cops don't seem to want to help and are equally as odd as the gang's brother and sister hosts - the five friends have to keep their wits and sanity about them and hatch an ingenious plan as the road-trip adventure rapidly turns into whirlwind of spooks and crazy mysterious goings-on. From the hit TV show "Friday Download" comes this hilarious teen caper starring the show's cast alongside comedian David Mitchell Tyger Drew-Honey Dionne Bromfield and guest appearances from pop-group The Vamps and duo Bars & Melody.
