Told over the span of one night IMPUNITY is a modernization of Edgar Allan Poe's The Cask of Amontillado a psychological tale of revenge that slowly amasses cunning sets of contradictions and subtle schemes which cohere together as a whole upon reaching its inevitable climax. Based on one of Poe's most subtle and ambiguous fables IMPUNITY tells the story of Darren Montresor (Cole) an astute young man who arrives at an ordinary house party with the concealed plan of enacting revenge upon Gabriel Fortunato (Chesbro) - his best friend. As the night develops Montresor uses careful planning and the masterful manipulation of others to truly punish Fortunato for his mysterious actions. Adhering to a family motto that assures 'nobody will wound him with impunity' the audience will be taken inside this subjective mind so only we can comprehend what Montresor might do next. IMPUNITY is the debut feature by college student writer/director team of Zac Petrillo & Chris Purcell. Working with an ultra-low budget Petrillo & Purcell have updated this story of mystery deception and horror while trying to maintain all of Poe's most graceful touches.
