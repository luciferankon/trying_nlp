Melli (19) is getting out of juvenile hall after a good 5 months. She promised herself: no more trouble. But first she realizes that someone specific is not there to pick her up - her boyfriend Yuri the one being responsible for all that trouble. He's not even answering her calls. Fortunately her girls are prepared to cheer her up - with sparkling wine in heaps and a surprising performance from a stripper. But her friends already know that Yuri has a new girlfriend. They try to hide the bad news - obviously. The situation escalates.
