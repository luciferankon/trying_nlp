For the first time ever award-winning fine art photographer Drew Doggett has created a documentary film of his journey to the Sossusvlei desert in Namibia for his latest photography collection Dunes: Landscapes Evolving. The film gives viewers a behind-the-scenes perspective of his whirlwind journey and offers his collectors an inside look into his creative process and the inspiration behind the collection. The footage is accompanied by an original score composed by multi-platinum and Grammy-winning composer Christopher Ward who has produced World song recordings alongside Hans Zimmer for movies such as Pearl Harbor and The Lion King.
