A short film collage themed around the 4 elements (fire earth water wind). The goal of this collage was to incorporate film techniques we wanted to learn and/or master including: Steadicam dolly shots time lapse and slow motion. The story line is up for interpretation and we encourage the audience to use their imaginations and fill in whatever story comes to their minds.
