Upon the outbreak of war in August 1914 the lives of 10 men from Bagley-on-the-Wold in rural England are changed forever. These men answer their country's call and join one of Lord Kitchener's original "Pals" battalions. Their initial elation at "doing their bit" for King and Country soon evaporates as they witness the horrors of trench warfare. "The Bagley Boys" follows the lives of these 10 men and their families from 1914 to 1918 as they deal with the hardships of life at the front the pain of separation from their loved ones and the knowledge that not all of them will return home.
