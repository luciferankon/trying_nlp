A five star hotel located in Antalya Turkey has been inherited by Ardeshir Rouhafza and his wife from his late uncle. The uncle's attorney has suggested that they sell it. Both Ardeshir and his wife noticed that recently the hotel and its personnel were under a disorderly condition due to not having a manager available. They decide to change this situation and not to make any hasty decisions. Meanwhile their daughter and son-in-law anonymously enter the hotel accompanied by their children and after a few minutes from their arrival they notice everything and try to inform the parents without creating a scene. On the other hand the hotel personnel realize the consequences of their wrongful behavior and become worried of losing their jobs after the family meeting. Therefore they decide to accept the attorney's offer and convince the Rouhafza family to sell the hotel. If so not only they would be able to keep their jobs but also they would be rewarded with a generous commission. Nonetheless the new owners decide to face each problem positively and not to withdraw. This is how the story begins.
