This is the story of a journey made by a young religious family: Yael Yoni and their three-year-old son Yiftach. Yoni once a barely observant Jew is now devoted to the passionately Hassidic Breslov tradition. His wife Yael has remained in a more moderate mainstream branch of Judaism. Yiftach's third birthday falls on the holiday of Lag Ba'omer and Yoni wants to take Yiftach through a masculine rite of passage -the halakeh ceremony where a boy's hair is cut for the first time leaving only his ear-locks. The long journey to Mount Meron brings their conflict into sharp relief. Their encounters with various characters along the way further highlight the chasm which has developed between them.
