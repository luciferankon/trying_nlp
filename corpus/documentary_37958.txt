As the first hotel was created as protection from the weather. Weary travelers could rest. But it was also a place of fairy tales and stories. In ten years Kristian Petri gathered material for this film. Here and there are both dead and alive hotel guests. The film hotel is the last part of a trilogy about travel. The first two were the "Atlanten" and "Fyren". "Hotellet" is a different temporary home. It can serve as a refuge dead end castle nightmare or a creative place.
