Letters to Addy is based my own letter to "Addy" after the death of my niece due to a heroin overdose in 2014. "Addy" is addiction. In this moving art film which is part documentary and part fiction Addy is the villain who all the characters feel compelled to love or destroy. "Letters to Addy" was my answer to a feeling of complete helplessness as addiction continued to destroy the people closest to me.
