Oregon fur traders are attempting to keep pioneers migrating westward out of the territory by inciting the Indians to attack their wagon trains. The U.S. Army sends Tex Masters ('Tex Ritter' (qv)) to uncover who is supplying the Indians with Army rifles. He and his pal Rawhide ('Nelson McDowell' (qv)) ---called "Lucky" in the credits and pressbook---join up with the wagon train headed by Benson ('Frank LaRue' (qv)) and his daughter Ruth ('Muriel Evans' (qv)). When a staged "accident" almost kills Benson Tex discovers it was the work of Matt Grimes ('Tom London' (qv)) the train scout but can't prove it. He and Grimes have a row when Tex insists that the train take a different route from the one Grimes recommends and Grimes quits the train and goes off the set the Indians on Benson's outfit. Tex saves the train but Ruth and her father now believe that Tex is in league with the Indians and they fire him. In town Tex and Rawhide see Grimes conferring with Steve Coleman ('Reed Howes' (qv)) a fur trader. That night Tex sneaks into Coleman's store and finds a huge supply of Army rifles ready to be sent to the Indians. He also hears Coleman telling henchman Slade ('Nolan Willis (I)' (qv)) to wipe out the wagon train. Tex is accidentally locked in the storeroom but gets free and sends Rawhide for the Army. Tex gets to the wagon train just as the attack by the Indians and Coleman's renegades starts. Tex and Rawhide join a wagon train heading for Oregon. When the guide tries to lead the train astray Tex exposes his plan and is made the new guide. The guide that quit then gets the Indians to attack the train. The train is saved but it appears Tex led them into trouble and he is dismissed. Tex relizes the guide has a boss that is behind all the trouble and he and Rawhide set out to find him.
