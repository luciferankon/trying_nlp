Transhuman is a compelling original dramatic sci-fi television series that is not only fantastically futuristic in concept but refreshingly relatable to current events. It takes place in a world where we have made significant advancements in science and technology while collectively as a species actually working to achieve world peace. However it is in this progress that we have forgotten that acceptance understanding and peace itself cannot be scientifically engineered but must come organically from within. We have to be the change we wish to see in the world - or history will be sure to repeat itself even more devastating than before.
