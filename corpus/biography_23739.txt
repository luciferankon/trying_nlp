We hear him speak in 4 languages: English Portuguese Indonesian and his native Tetun. As we traverse this mystical land of cloud-enshrouded mountains emerald jungles and turquoise seas he is the conduit to other colourful characters with powerful personal stories: An old man tortured and mutilated by fellow Timorese as well as Indonesian soldiers but who calls on all to "Be free... including from hatred"; a nun who witnessed the massacre of hundreds; the man who betrayed Gusmao into Indonesian hands. Firsts: The physical journey reveals the raw awesome beauty of Timor-Leste to the world for the very first time.
