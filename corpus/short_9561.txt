Four children about eight to ten years of age sit around a nearly empty set complaining about all the rules they must follow - whether from parents teachers or other adults. An off-screen narrator invites them to imagine a place with no rules and they're transported to an island of the imagination. They're excited at first but as they try to play games explore gather shells to make a necklace get food attend to an injury and eat they find that life without rules is more than difficult. Four adolescents are lamenting the fact of rules in their lives - such basic rules as walk don't run and don't talk back - which they believe are restricting the fun they can have. An off screen adult allows them to experience what life would be like without rules. As rules exist in any existing human society the four are whisked off in their imagination to a deserted tropical island. The four quickly learn that rules exist in ways they didn't even understand such as in games the rules which are required to make the games fun. They learn that rules exist for more important reasons like fairness health and safety which could be a matter of life or death. But they also learn that rules exist only among those that can understand and respect them.
