Ryan Alexander (mid thirties) a capable strong Iraq War veteran has struggled to support his family since leaving the Army. A beloved uncle Jim Alexander a homicide detective passes away and bequeaths his large home and all his furnishings to Ryan. Ryan moves into his late uncle's home with his common-law wife Kate Ramos (also in her thirties) a strong outspoken Latina and their five year old son Nathan. Ryan and Kate are a couple who have remained very much in love. From day one dark incidents occur. The poltergeist activity is at first ignored. Ryan finds plausible reasons for everything - until he and Kate are both nearly killed by an ancient evil that inhabits the very walls of the structure. They are saved through the intervention of a wise and mystical Indian Swamiand Hindu priest Saatvik Nath. He is joined by a mysterious Caribbean woman Miriam Johnson who is both a gifted psychic and an expert in demonology. Both warn Kate and Ryan of the dangers and the couple is urged to leave the home. An obnoxious and demagogic local pastor Robert Belair claiming to be an old friend of Ryan's uncle offers instead to perform an exorcism. He goes so far as to tell Ryan the secret behind the home's evil: The remains of a devil-worshiping serial killer were interred on the premises. "Uncle Jimmy" had a dark secret. He had taken it upon himself to execute the murderer not trusting the justice system. Ryan agrees to the exorcism. Pastor Robert performs a dramatic ritual. He then declares the house clean. But something diabolical still remains. It isn't until their son is abducted by an extra dimensional demonic force that Ryan awakens to a new reality that forces him to confront evil beyond anything he could ever imagine. In the end Ryan and Kate - with the help of Saatvik and Miriam - engage in a fierce eternal battle to regain their family across dark dimensions - within a stunning and horrifying twist that will grip audiences until the very end.
