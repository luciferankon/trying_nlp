Censored by the Polish authorities this film was reedited and new footage added. It begins with a sci-fi motif: abstract images and electronic music take the viewer from ruins of Lebanon to the set of Voelker Schloendorf "The Forgery" where Skolimowski plays a lead role. Another shift takes us to London where Skolimowski shoots a street scene. There are also shifts into the past with the old footage featuring a score of Polish actors in a setting resembling Kantor's experimental theatre.
