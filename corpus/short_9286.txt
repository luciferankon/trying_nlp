Territory is a poetic essay on feminine identity and perception. It is the other's reflection upon us the act of dissolving one's self to the surrounding world. Territory is an essay on identity and perception. It is the interweaving of fascination and slowness. It is the contrast of loneliness and eluding. It is two women evolving through their bodies through movement and space. It is a poetic film about duality and the influence that things and people have on us. Territory is a vague thought on a perpetual duplication of women and their environment and the quest for exploring new locations.
