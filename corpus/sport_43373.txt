ITV broadcast the coverage of Formula One races in the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2008.ITV gained the rights for Formula One coverage for 1997 in late 1995 from the BBC and focused on more in-depth coverage conducting more interviews and gaining access to better camera angles. The coverage was initially presented by Jim Rosenthal with veteran commentator Murray Walker and former racing driver Martin Brundle being the initial commentators before Walker's retirement after the 2001 United States Grand Prix and was succeeded by pit-lane reporter James Allen.
