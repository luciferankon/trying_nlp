Denny Traynor has the idyllic life a loving wife and family a flourishing career. Seems like life is perfect until some policemen from another break into their home one night and arrest him for a twenty year old murder. Initially Denny denies the accusations made against him but when evidence is presented that implicates him he is then extradited to stand trial. When his wife whose faith has been shaken asks him what happened he tells her that he did kill the man they said he killed but in self-defense. However when there is no evidence that supports his claim his wife wonders if he has told her the truth and if she should continue to support him.
