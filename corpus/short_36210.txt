A set of two behind the scenes footage segments can be seen. One of these shows the "Funeral Parade" sequence that comes at the start of the film. Moore offers comments about the actor used in that scene. The other clip details the "Hang Gliding" scene and it shows us Moore as he's about to take flight.
