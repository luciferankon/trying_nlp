Following the travel agency's recommendation the four of them finally arrive at this dream hotel by the beach filled with high expectations of having a good time however right from the start the sense of a strange vibe emanating from the place is predominant. Obviously there must be something wrong with this hotel because it appears to be completely vacant the beach is deserted and the concierge is nowhere to be found. After the initial disappointment things begin to work out when suddenly the mysterious and secretive director of the hotel Carlo Savonarola arrives to make the necessary arrangements and to show them to their rooms. The feeling of uneasiness is intensified when in the middle of the night the wailing sound of the wind blowing and the echoes from the empty corridors start bringing chills to the girls forcing for answers. Is this situation linked somehow to the grim history of this hotel and moreover what lies hidden behind the thick stone walls of this abandoned convent dating back to 1749?
