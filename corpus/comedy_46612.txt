Squire Haggard the womanising destitute former friend of the Prince of Wales optimistically searches for rich men "willing" to part with their money and rich beautiful women willing to part with their virtue. His handsome son Roderick a typical Regency Buck falls in love very easily and the objects of his desire just happen to be very beautiful Ladies of Quality who are heiresses to large fortunes. Squire Haggard desperate to restore the family fortune often uses his son in his 'get rich quick' schemes - however Roderick's foolishness usually brings his father's schemes undone. Their sly underhanded servant Grunge despises his 'put upon' position in life and through guile and other means has actually been able to acquire more wealth than his master. This money however is often at stake through the Squire's involving Grunge in his plots.
