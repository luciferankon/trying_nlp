Inspired by a true story Soul City the tale of a former civil rights activist's struggle to create an equal-opportunity city in a rural section of deforested land in rural North Carolina is an expression of one man's desire to do the impossible and the necessary consequences that come with it. Soul City adds a tragic twist to the traditional 'creation myth' and does so in a 1960's setting the peak of social progress in America's defining 20th century still fresh in the minds of American and international audiences. Soul City is historic in its aims and intentions but utilizes modern storytelling strategies characters and interactions to create an engrossing picture.
