Good Guys and Bad Guys is a post-Cold War romp through suburban Los Angeles. In 1996 expatriate filmmaker Rick Minnich returned to his native California for his ten-year high school class reunion to confront the right-wing suburban "patriots" who had made his life miserable during the Reagan era. The result is an entertaining and provocative look at what has become of the "Good Guys and Bad Guys" of yesteryear.
