The movie captures the responses of 31 authors musicians filmmakers and dancers to Olivier Messiaen's monumental organ work "Apparition of the Eternal Church." Listening to the 10-minute piece through headphones the documentary subjects-most of whom are outsiders to the church and do not know what they're hearing-put Messiaen's project to the test: Is it possible to portray through time-bound invisible sound the spiritual the architectural the eternal? The result is a collective interpretation improvising its way through an aesthetic landscape defined by violent contradictions. Resolution abuts eternity eroticism asceticism spiritual ecstasy physical torture. Together the music and its interpreters conjure something like what William Blake famously called the marriage of heaven and hell.
