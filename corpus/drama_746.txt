Caskie Jones last saw his father thirty years ago yet he's still very much a chip off the brawling boozing block. When his wife finally tosses him out Caskie goes looking for the old man. The road leads to a dusty New Mexico town and more than he bargained for in the form of Tanner Wild a tart-tongued teenager and prodigal singer/songwriter who unwittingly forces Caskie to confront his past in this antihero tale powered by a killer Americana soundtrack.
