Tasos Pafralides and his sister Evdokia run a business selling heating oil to their fellow citizens in Thessaloniki. With the crisis ever deepening fewer and fewer Greeks can afford to buy oil and keep themselves warm. Therefore Tasos and Evdokia face a sharp dilemma every day: should they really refuse heating oil to people who don't have the money leaving them in the cold? As their customers struggle to make ends meet Tasos and Evdokia struggle to keep their business going. In their daily encounters and in the whole of Greek society relationships between the people are at stake. How warm or cold can relationships between people be when a deep crisis forces everyone to fend for themselves?
