What does the Bible mean when it tells us to fear God? Is it a kind of respect or reverence as many in the church seem to see it today or is it really more of a paralyzing fear that can drive you to your knees in trembling? A clear understanding of what the Bible teaches can lead to a true fear of God which can ultimately lead to the life we were intended to live.
