House is a feeling... one that got its start by blending genres and unifying races at the unforgettable Warehouse parties. Featuring artists who have made their names in house and shape what it is today (Colette Derrick Carter Mark Farina and more) Unconscious Therapy tells the whole house story and keeps the feeling going. It's an homage to a form of dance music that Chicago has proudly called its own.
