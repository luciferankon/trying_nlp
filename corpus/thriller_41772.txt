How many Egyptian giallo/rape-revenge/social dramas do you know of? Well now you now of at least one. One might hope for something really really weird and alien from such a concoction but you'd only be partially correct. While it does have some (very) surprising sleaze as well as some odd hypnotic passages for the most part LADY KILLER kind of just plods along dealing with its own conservative Arab society concerns uninterested in whatever the outside world might think.
