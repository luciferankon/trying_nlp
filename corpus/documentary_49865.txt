In May of 1997 Lou Gerard packed up his cluttered forty-year old tailor shop to move to La Vegas and live the life he has always dreamed about. 'Rent is cheap over there' he explains 'and if you know what you are doing in gambling you could make a few bucks.' Dreamland documents Lou's experiences as he tries to create a life for himself in Las Vegas revealing the challenge of economic and emotional survival in an environment where everything is permissible and available -twenty-four days.
