A Berlin entrepreneur and his family regularly come to Tyrol for holidays. Although the locals dislike the haughty attitude of the Germans they persuade him that building a snow-cannon factory in their village would be beneficial to all sides. The series reflects in a satirical way on Tyrol's growing dependency on tourism and on Tyrolean's loss of their identity resulting from this.
