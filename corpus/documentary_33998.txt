Mark Hamill is hosting an informational tour through the history of science fiction movie-making. The focus is not on special effects and action scenes but on the relationship between society's hangups and fears and the subject matter of the movies. The effects of the American public's changing paranoias e.g. the communist scare is particularly well explored.
