Set in pre-revolutionary Egypt this comedy centers on a village ruled by an Omda (mayor) who extorts money and goods from the villagers and embezzles money sent to the village by the government in Cairo. The Omda becomes worried when he hears a rumor that Cairo will be sending an Inspector General to investigate reports of corruption. He incorrectly assumes that Saber a penniless fertilizer inspector staying at the local hotel is the Inspector General incognito and begins trying to curry favor with him. Upon realizing there is a case of mistaken identity Saber's friend Gaber pushes him to exploit it. The comedy continues as the Omda's wife Shakhlaa a former dancer who retired from public life when she married the Omda sees the visiting "Inspector General" as an opportunity to escape the confines of the village and her oppressive husband. At the same time the Omda's daughter Latafa falls for the visiting inspector. With everyone around him scheming to exploit Saber to further their own agendas he finds himself faced with the dilemma of whether to continue exploiting the situation or take the honorable way out.
