We take a future trip through our exploratory past. From our initial launches of artificial satellites to men traveling to the Moon. From the construction of the first International Space Station to the first active Lunar Bases. From the first manned missions to Mars to the first autonomous self-sustained colonies surviving off Earth. Explore Mankind's first one hundred years in Space. Join us on "Odyssey of Survival".
