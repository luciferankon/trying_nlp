Super heroes by day rock stars by night -- and they still need to do homework. Each of the girls has special powers. Each episode will also have a moral lesson but it won't hit viewers over the head with the lesson. The world knows that the girls are rock stars and super heroes so if the girls want to go out in public they need to wear disguises which basically consist of fact glasses.
