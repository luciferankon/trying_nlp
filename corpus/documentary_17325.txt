A film about an 85 year old woman who watches the world she dreamed of collapse all around her. The kibbutz she lives in Yad Hannah has abandoned the ideology her children have left Israel capitalism is forcing socialism out and wars push the 'brotherhood of nations' ideal further away. Pnina is a Red Army kind of nurse and a Che Guevara kind of revolutionary. The film is a contemporary journey of an extreme uncompromising woman alone in a battle to change the new world surrounding her. Pnina does everything with the passion of a young girl on a mission enthralled with holy rage just as she was in the communist youth movement. Despite everything falling apart around her she gets up every morning filled with fighting spirit and goes on because she knows that the revolution will eventually prevail.
