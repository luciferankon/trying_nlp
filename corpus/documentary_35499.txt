As the 44th president's chief photographer Pete Souza is never far behind President Obama. Now in the National Geographic Special The President's Photographer: 50 Years in the Oval Office viewers can follow Souza and those who came before him for a behind-the-scenes look at the everyday grit of the American presidency. Offering a chance to see what it's like to cover the most powerful man in the world for history. The presidential photographer's job is two-fold: one taking photographs of the president greeting dignitaries visitors and guests; and two perhaps more challenging and gratifying: documenting for history every possible aspect of the presidency both official events backstage happenings and "off-duty" private moments. "Creating a good photographic archive for history is the most important part of my job creating this archive that will live on" says Souza. "This is not so much photojournalism as photo-history." Souza and his staff produce up to 20000 pictures a week.
