Harry had been adopted as a child and had grown up in the belief that he had no siblings. Shortly before his 35th birthday he gets a call from a man claiming to be his half-brother. Out of curiosity more than anything else Harry agrees to meet up with the man. Harry's brother is Jewish and reveals that Harry has a whole Jewish family that he never knew existed. As Harry is struggling to get to grips with his new found identity he also falls in love with Pru Caplin a beautiful and charming girl that he meets through work. There is clearly a mutual spark from the first moment that they meet; the only problem being that Pru is engaged to Simon a hugely charismatic and extremely successful business man but nonetheless a devious and soulless psychopath who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Simon has the money the power and the girl. Harry's only asset is a good heart. As fate throws Harry and Pru together it seems they share much in common some of which could serve to rip them apart rather than draw them closer together.
