This documentary retraces the factual as well as emotional and geographical case histories of five men who for various reasons are "on the run": Daniel Bloch (Swiss imprisoned again and again) Jean-Claude Pirotte (Belgian lawyer) César Battisti (Italian terrorist) André Pauly (French burglar) Yazid Kherfi (Algerian gangster). It presents and analyzes their life trajectories in each case very much like a race that has been run and lost here expressed as a collection of moments of offbeat humor absurdly funny and yet tragic.
