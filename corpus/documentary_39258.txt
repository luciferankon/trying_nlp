Toward the end of the nineteenth century with Porfirio Díaz in power the state of Coahuila one of the most desolate and least populated regions of the earth began to show signs of amazing vitality. The discovery of enormous coal mines the progression of a vast landed estate dedicated to cotton production in La Laguna and shortly after the development of the steel and iron industry headed by Altos Hornos de México all made the state a bastion of Mexican industrialization. From its new industrial orientation linked to the automotive industry and high-quality manufacturing Coahuila faces the challenges of global competition.
