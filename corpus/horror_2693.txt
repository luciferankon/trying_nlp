Todd is a handyman for a house rental company that is forced to clean a unit where he found the dead body of the tenant several weeks before. While cleaning he comes in contact with a possible drug that enhances the imagination. He finds that the imagination is not just thought but is a sense that sees something best not seen by man...something that will lead him into the discovery of evil spirits that live all around us in the dark. Things that have existed for years in the shadows and don't like being seen.
