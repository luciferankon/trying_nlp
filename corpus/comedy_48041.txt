To be a Pet Detective you have to understand both the criminals and animals. Ace Ventura goes even further... He behaves like a criminal animal. When a football team's mascot (a dolphin) is stolen just before the Superbowl Ace Ventura is put on the case. Now who would want to steal a dolphin and why? He's the best there is. In fact he's the only one there is! He's Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Ace is on the case to find the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot and quarterback Dan Marino. He goes eyeball to eyeball with a man-eating shark stakes out the Miami Dolphins and woos and wows the ladies. Whether he's undercover under fire or underwater he always gets his man . . . or beast!
