The Canary Protocol is a story about young lady that due to a spell cast upon her family centuries ago can see angels and ghouls that arrive to collect the souls of dying people. But is no generic ghost story. Through an unfortunate twist of fate the CIA learns of her visions and wants to discover how her uncanny abilities work. Their idea is to use her special ability to warn agents on high profile missions of impending danger much like the miners of years past used canaries to warn of dangerous conditions. However they soon discover that fate was not meant to be cheated and sometimes life is not as it seems.
