Using his mother's life as inspiration the filmmaker has created a film that explores how we share life's journey with the opposite sex. His and Hers is an investigation into the ordinary to discover the extraordinary. It finds comedy in the mundane tragedy in the profound and provides an original insight into a life. The hallways living rooms and kitchens of the Irish Midlands are used as the canvas for the film's rich tapestry of female characters. The story unfolds sequentially through young to old with a charmingly unabashed array of Irish ladies and there's not a man in sight.
