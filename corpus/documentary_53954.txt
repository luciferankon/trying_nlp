Jill Kohfield was the first born of fraternal twin girls in 1965. At birth Jill was severely brain damaged which left her intellectually disabled (formerly known as mentally retarded). At eight years old Jill was placed in a group home where she would spend the next forty years of her life. In recent years Jill's health was rapidly deteriorating and in February 2014 Jill moved back in with her mother and twin sister. In The Quality of Life we explore what people with disabilities go through what their families go through and the negative aspects of group homes/institutions which include physical abuse sexual abuse and over-medication.
