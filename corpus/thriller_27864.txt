Maggie (Nikki Fritz) takes matters (among other things) into her hands when her boyfriend gets in over his head with gambling debts. She agrees to be Carl the gangster's sex slave (more or less) for a week. Things get complicated when Carl's personal assistant/undercover agent blackmails Maggie into getting the goods on him.
