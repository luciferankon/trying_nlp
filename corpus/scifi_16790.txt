Slow business and low crime has dwindled the crew economy to all but a dry bed. Hard pressed by guilt and desperate for cash the ship's captain Jacen Harth agrees to ferry two young Jedi Padawans across the galaxy. The trip is simple enough: safe passage to Coruscant. But there's just one thing they're being hunted and the one who wants them dead happens to be the President of a galactic military weapons development firm which gives him pretty much limitless resources to catch them. They'll have to stay under the radar to reach their destination without incident but that's next to impossible with the increasingly annoying rival pirate Kyp Duron and his gang already hot on their trail. The Force certainly has a funny way of bringing things full circle when Ban teams up with Kyp and Jacen finds out who the maniacal tycoon really is. Running simply may not be an option.
