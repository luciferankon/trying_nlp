'In 2013 The Finnish National Ballet is invited to perform "The Rite of Spring" by Igor Stravinsky and Vaslav Nijinsky at the renowned Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. This is the company's first performance at the Bolshoi -Â an historic event and a great challenge for the National Ballet. "Chosen Ones" follows three dancers as they get ready to enter the celebrated stage and greet the demanding Russian audience. With 125 jumps and complex movements dancing the solo piece is likened to running a marathon. But for Maki Nagagawa Mira Ollila and Auri Ahola this is a journey beyond just the physical efforts. "Chosen Ones" delves into the fundamental human need to express oneself and the will to share this moment with other people.'
