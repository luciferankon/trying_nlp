People of the Wasteland is a short-film of 24 minutes that focuses on the concept of war. It presents footage filmed and gathered during more than two years through a GoPro camera placed on the heads of different Syrian fighters in the enemy region. The film presents the violence and the horrors of war in a first-perspective point-of-view. The editing uses reality and experimental styles in order to reflect the absurdity of war. The location of the film is intentionally unclear appearing only as the "wasteland" with the aim of making the concept of war a global concept that not only affects Syrians but all humans.
