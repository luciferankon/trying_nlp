Seven years ago fans were giddy with anticipation for the Prequel trilogy but now that there aren't any new theatrical films to look forward to the mood is considerably more somber notes Cioletti. "And it didn't help that Episodes I to III didn't live up to some fans' unrealistically high expectations. Whether you loved the prequels or hated them Galaxy's End: Revenge of the Myth hopefully will offer a little closure at the end of an era." The Star Wars universe is familiar territory for Cioletti. His first documentary Millennium's End: The Fandom Menace chronicled fans' anticipation for Star Wars Episode I during the two years leading up to its release. It's only fitting that his new film should cover the aftermath. Many of the same personalities from Millennium's End: The Fandom Menace return to offer their analyses on the prequel trilogy the state of fandom and the uncertainty of the years that lie ahead. "The two films are sort of bookends for the Prequel era" Cioletti explains. Galaxy's End: The Fandom Menace is a follow-up to the documentary Millennium's End: The Fandom Menace. This time Star Wars fans offer a Monday-morning-quarterback analysis on the prequel trilogy and ponder the question "What happens now that there will never be another big-screen Star Wars movie?"
