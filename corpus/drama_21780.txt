Using the human face as its landscape this dogme-esque exploration of desire takes place over the course of one night and was crafted by 'UNICA' a filmmaking collaborative that shares a group credit. Born out of a deep collaboration between the filmmakers and the highly gifted cast this unscripted and entirely improvised story culminates in a simple and unforgettable moment of truth and beauty. On the night of her 35th birthday Colleen throws a party to introduce her closest friends to Dan the man she is certain is the love of her life. None of them have ever met Dan and everybody eagerly anticipates his arrival. However Dan's conspicuous absence begins to have an unexpected effect on the party as truths unfold. Blue in Green examines suffering caused by desire and reveals for Colleen over the course of one night's event a path to confronting her essential truth.
