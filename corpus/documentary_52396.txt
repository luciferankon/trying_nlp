The Harrier - the World's best selling combat 'jump jet'. The reality - the harrier is still one jump ahead of its rivals. We salute it's achievements in peace and war over land and sea through test and research and the test pilots who lifted the first RAF Harrier into the air in 1966 and the squadron pilots who flew her in the fiercest of firefights - in the Falklands campaign and Bosnia.
