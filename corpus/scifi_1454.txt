Columbia's 43rd serial finds Lex Luthor secretly the Atom Man blackmailing the city of Metropolis by threatening to destroy the entire community. Perry White editor of "The Daily Planet" assigns Lois Lane Jimmy Olson and Clark Kent/Superman to cover the story. Luthor invents a number of deadly devices to plague the city including a disintegrating machine which can reduce people to their basic atoms and reassemble them in another place. But Superman manages to thwart each scheme. Since Kryptonite can rob Superman of his powers Luthor decides to create a synthetic Kryptonite and putters about obtaining the necessary ingredients: plutonium radium and the undefined 'etc.'(in order to keep viewers from trying this at home). Luthor places the Kryptonite at the launching of a ship with Superman in attendance. He is exposed to the Kryptonite and passes out. Superman is taken off in an ambulance driven by Luthor's henchmen and he is now under the control of Luthor. Superman is placed in a device a lever is pulled and the Man of Steel vanishes into "The Empty Doom." With eight chapters remaining the odds are high he will return. Most of chapter 7 is a repeat of the origin story from chapter 1 of Columbia's first "Superman" serial and this serial also finds a way to work in stock footage from Ken Maynard's 1936 "Avenging Waters" minus ol' Ken and his hoss Tarzan.
