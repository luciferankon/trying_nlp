Gemini's are a mischievous lot. Be it a child or an old man they are most unpredictable with their sense of humor. Women married to men under this sign should be careful when they talk to them. A wife asked her Gemini husband "What is the difference between trust and truth" The husband replied "You are the mother of our two kids is the truth but me being their father is my trust in you".
