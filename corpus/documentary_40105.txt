After completing the Marathon Des sables in 2002 the Save the Rhino team sat down to discuss what they could do next. They came up with the idea of walking The Rift Valley. In 2015 Robert Devereux set out to do it himself. The Rift is a feature length documentary following the epic travels of Robert Devereux as he makes his way up the entire Rift Valley in East Africa. "The Rift" tells the stories from this unique and wonderful adventure followed by his son questioning his dubious choices in life.
