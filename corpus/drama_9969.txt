A visual poem based on a story by Nobel laureate F.E. Sillanpää. The fates of various characters become interlaced over a long and light-filled summer night in the Finnish countryside. Lumberjacks a deer-eyed young man Nokia a family of poor farmers a young girl and her lover... New life is born old life dies man is slain in his prime and his widow continues her life.
