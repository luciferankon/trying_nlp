Not Quite There follows the erratic lives of three girls in the city of LA: Rachel a girl-jock just in from Minnesota looking for more in life than her small town could offer; Aurora whose "New Age Hippie" surface conceals more than it reveals; and Kelly the former child star who drowns her past in levity - and the closest bottle of vodka. The series focuses on the struggles of finding meaning in life of making real friends of sharing your true self and learning how to convince the guy at the bar that yes you really are a lesbian you're not just turning him down.
