As so often also here it's rather about allusion than description. This also applies to the persons represented. Flat silhouettes of people. Their heads depicted in profile. Faces with no expression formal gestures. In the background a little bit of everyday life: The hard square stone architecture arises from ocher-colored brownish blackish mush of color or mud. A demonstration of the function of the central perspective. An idealized representation of a tropical paradise. Strangely there's no absurdity in this.
