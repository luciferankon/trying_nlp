Convention requires every Catholic family to name at least one of their daughters in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary: Mary Maryanne Marion... BAPTISM is about how writer and filmmaker Marilyn Freeman could never get in synch with that name - Marilyn. In a telling so intimate it seems to come over a telephone as midnight Freeman delivers her story in a one-of-a-kind family portrait. An unexpected visual mix accompanies her voice while a rotating cast of lip-synching Marilyn stand-ins enact the effort to conform. Funny affecting and original BAPTISM is a video essay about mystical inheritances a mother's secret and family.
