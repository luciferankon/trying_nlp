A documentary on the threat that climate change poses to the Earth - it's causes effects and history and potential solutions to it. Presented by Al Gore through a lecture that he has given to audiences across the globe plus through more introspective moments. Director 'Davis Guggenheim' (qv) eloquently weaves the science of global warming with Mr. Gore's personal history and lifelong commitment to reversing the effects of global climate change. A longtime advocate for the environment Gore presents a wide array of facts and information in a thoughtful and compelling way. "'Al Gore (I)' (qv) strips his presentations of politics laying out the facts for the audience to draw their own conclusions in a charming funny and engaging style and by the end has everyone on the edge of their seats gripped by his haunting message" said Guggenheim. An Inconvenient Truth is not a story of despair but rather a rallying cry to protect the one earth we all share. "It is now clear that we face a deepening global climate crisis that requires us to act boldly quickly and wisely" said Gore.
