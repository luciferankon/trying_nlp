In Rio de Janeiro Jacinto Brochard owns the massage parlor "Academia Măos de Ouro" and the gay Florindo Bocăo runs the business establishment. When they discover that two masseuses are prostituting in the place Jacinto fires them and invites the virgins from the countryside Virgem and Berta to work in the massage parlor. The womanizer driver Duda de Almeida brings the women to the boarding house of Ms. Maria. Duda is hired as instructor by Jacinto and the hits on Maria's servant Julieta; on Gafanha the wife of Maria's lodger Fung-Ku; and on the masseuses of the massage parlor. Meanwhile clients make a fuss in the place when the impotent Artur meets his wife Mara and her two lovers Serginho and Leăo in the massage parlor.
