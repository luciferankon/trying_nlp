Twenty five years after defending the people of California Zorro has fallen a victim of age. The people are still being oppressed now by Commandant Paco Pico and his aide Sergeant Sepulveda so Zorro's faithful servant Bernardo sends for Zorro's son who is living in Spain. The son turns out to be a swinger always chasing the women gambling and using modern weapons (guns gas bombs etc.) in his war on Pico.
