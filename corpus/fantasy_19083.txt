In this direct follow-up to a fairy tale comedy _Kacenka a strasidla (1993)_ (qv) the supernatural beings try to prevent their house of horrors from being reconstructed into an attractive villa. They count on the arrival of a Viennese notary who is to verify whether the fun park amusement is fulfilling its original purpose. After it's all been resolved Kacenka's uncle puts on a bit of amateur theatricals in which the ghosts themselves humorously participate.
