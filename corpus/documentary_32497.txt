My father Isaac Perkal (67) was born in Poland. The horrors of the Holocaust were still fresh but nobody wanted to recall them. As a child he migrated to Uruguay where the Perkal's were able to have a new life and never looked back again. Today his fight against cancer drives him in this search for his identity and his silent past. Is it possible to heal from tragedy? "Perkal: the memory of a name" is a creative documentary which intends to reflect on the weight of memory survival and humor as a transformation tool through my father's story and our family name.
