The first of the series known as (and called such by Monogram) the "Bill 'n Andy" series with western star Bill Cody and a young Andy Shuford. Not a series in the usual sense as neither played continuing characters in the series and weren't always called Bill and Andy. Cody's trademark---intentional or otherwise---was a 20-gallon hat rather than the usual 10-gallon variety and clothes that always seemed to have been made for someone a lot bigger than Bill Cody was... plus he would wear as many as three or four different hats (always big) within the same film and have at least two or more costume changes (none that fit his frame) in most of his films.Costume changes in B-Westerns was out of the norm primarily for budget and continuity reasons but Cody had a large wardrobe and evidently brought most of it with him with intent to use. This one has Andy's father dying in the desert and Cody comes along and adopts him or something. They help sheriff Manning chase down his crooked deputy Dan Kirk and Andy gets a deputy's badge (junior version) and Bill gets the sheriff's daughter June.
