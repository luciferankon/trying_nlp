A sunlit landscape. Green and lush. The emblem of our Danish childhood summer in the country. Before the world went out of joint. Though these landscapes Aage drives his bus every day. He has done so for ages. The bus was once a vital part of the local community. Today nobody uses it; but Aage obstinately drives the bus every day. Why? Does he want to preserve an innocent past? Soon something will happen that will bring Aage up to the present in one night.
