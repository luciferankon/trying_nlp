A hired killer breaks into a home and captures the three pretty inhabitants so he can assassinate their neighbor. The lovely ladies do their best to escape to warn the man but the cruel ropes and tight gags render their struggles useless. After accomplishing his gruesome mission the murderer announces he will release his captives - but only after playing a deadly game of Russian roulette with the helpless cuties. In the second story three coeds are enjoying a slumber party wearing sexy negligees when a masked villain breaks into their home and ropes and silences the girls before carrying out his own evil agenda.
