Brace yourselves for one of the most resplendent footnotes of rock 'n' roll anti-history ever to grace the silver screen. Danny Plotnick's I'm Not Fascinating-The Movie! chronicles the pointless shenanigans of San Francisco rock 'n' roll ne'er-do-wells the Icky Boyfriends and their futile quest for rock stardom. Undaunted by the universal hatred of both their music and their look the band perseveres somehow netting themselves a hefty major label contract. But stardom proves elusive as they descend into a world of intrigue nepotism consumer research groups excessive use of caffeine-laden soda pop and murder. Who kills the Ickys? You'll wish you had!
