With exclusive access to their most intimate meetings and their daily life we follow four death row exonarates in their effort to continue normally with their lives. They call themselves The Resurrection Club. We follow them with their families where they are trying to recover from the trauma and execution. We follow them in their struggle to find other exonarates to join the club and on their tour to speak out against the death penalty. An extraordinary story about trauma and resurrection. An epic movie with extraordinary characters. An empowering story. A celebration of life.
