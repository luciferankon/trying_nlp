Open House PGH and the Borland Green Cooperative discuss how their intentional communities share cooking and gardening responsibilities to strengthen their communities. But despite the fascinating developments in the alternative food movement these emerging opportunities require some amount of privilege and access to food. What happens if your access to healthy food is limited? Just Harvest's Ken Regal Felicia Lane Savage and others discuss the history of hunger posing the widespread issue as a symptom of poverty. After discussing the barriers to accessing food emergency solutions like food banks and 412 Food Rescue along with longer-term educational efforts like Community Kitchen Pittsburgh and community gardens are surveyed.
