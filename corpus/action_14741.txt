The year is 2016. After a long drawn out war in the Middle East a dismal world cup and a financially disastrous Olympics the UK is now a barren country. Jobs are a thing of privilege and luck Organised crime syndicates rule and dictate the working class and authorities turn a blind eye to this as police are under - staffed...Rioting is now a monthly occurrence and crime is rife in England...Sport especially English football has fallen into decline attitude to football has gone back twenty years. People are not going to games investors have pulled out the game and foreign players no longer want to be in the premiership...The biggest change is that football violence is back in the game...Laws in the land now govern that to be seen in a street gang is a year in prison no parole so people gather on the terraces in their large numbers... As the hooligans take back the stadiums football violence is most popular London and the Home Counties where there is at least now five hooligan gangs to every one team. However with the case of West Ham United there is just two...One of them is The Essex Warriors. When a big meeting of all the gangs is organised at Hyde Park by Apollo - head of Arsenal Bloods all hell breaks loose after Apollo is shot and killed. The Essex warriors are falsely accused of being the ones responsible now they must make their way back alive to Southend-on-sea before retribution is taken back to their own turf. The film is about their journey back to their own turf the fights they endure..and fighting to clear their name.
