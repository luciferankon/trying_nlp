A young French man travels to Poland and meets a young Polish woman who dreams about Paris and the Eiffel Tower. She leaves her gray 70s East-European life to finally live the big city Parisian dream with him. The film is a collage made from stills taken from a 70s french lesson book for polish speakers that belonged to the filmmaker's mother and an old communist-era atlas of Europe that belonged to her father. 'French Lessons' uses language lesson clich√©s to tell the story of modern life displacement and failed dreams in a context of Cold War Europe.
