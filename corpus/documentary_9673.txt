Following the outstandingly devoted fans of the Canadian Folk legend Gordon Lightfoot "Lightheaded" is loaded with incredible music and the influence Lightfoot's music has had on the people who choose to dedicate their time and love following this aging troubadour and his loyal band. This is not a documentary about Gordon Lightfoot; rather it is a heartwarming film highlighting the magic of the road and focuses on a family that was baptized and raised on Lightfoot's music. It captures that elusive somewhat undefinable element that makes our lives inextricably intertwined with songs and ultimately makes us all fans in the end. The movie is filmed through enchanting urban and countryside views of the United Kingdom and Ireland where Gordon Lightfoot and his band returned to tour for the first time in over 30 years. It features charming small-town Orillia Lightfoot's hometown and travels to Toronto Lightfoot's adopted hometown where he has been based throughout most of his career and in the U.S. Germany and Israel where the people who were touched by his beautiful work live and act.
