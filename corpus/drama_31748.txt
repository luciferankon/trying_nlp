It's an entertaining story and the dynamism formed by the characters brought to life by Kim Tae-woo and Yea Ji-won is equally entertaining. Although more emotional romantic and positive it recalls the films of Hong Sangsoo in its detailed descriptions of daily life and loose episodic structure. The performances are unmannered giving us the feeling we're casually watching lives unfold. And there's a self-reflective element to the film as well one that reflects reality. The main character the film director is the alter ego of director Cho Sung-kyu and the inside this film  is his debut feature film. The cinema the nurse visits is SpongehouseKwanghwamoon which director Cho currently administers. Is Hong's signature style a tonic in the context of this film or a poison? Ultimately that's up to audience to decide.
