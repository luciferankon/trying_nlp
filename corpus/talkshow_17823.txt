SNL alumnus and former Weekend Update anchor Norm MacDonald hosts as he and his team of correspondents sort through the churning mass of pop culture and social media to pull out the funniest most bizarre and entertaining events so you don't have to. In this failed pilot for a potential series Norm tells some jokes and some pre-filmed skits are shown including Norm trying to sneak into Victoria's Secret wearing a cloak of invisibility and playing a displeased Clint Eastwood who gets angrier and angrier as his wife has a reality TV show filmed around her.
