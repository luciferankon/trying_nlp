With Extreme Cruelty is a film about passing the purgatory of thought and heart of great Bulgarian writer Svoboda Buchvarova about her lifetime vicissitudes in the troubled 20th c. about her personal metamorphose and dramatic catharsis. In the film she seeks salvation from the doubts gnawing at her over the meaning of faith and truth in an unceasing dialogue with her father Todor Angelov killed by Gestapo Belgium's national hero. Her Christian morality clashes with the rational idealism of her father with unity and emotional standoffs with antagonism and harmony in romantic empathy with the ideal and the chimera of its realization.
