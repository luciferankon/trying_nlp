Mountain landscapes Manhattan cityscapes and images from magazine covers and television news are fragmented in computer generated mattes. Intercut with a found documentary about family life in Malaysia the film becomes an essay on reading. Watching the film is like an accelerated game of Concentration with glimpses of the image appearing inside swirling grids. The juxtaposition of the gridded sequences to the conventionally assembled Malaysian footage formulates an inquiry into the nature and meaning of the "document" in cinema.
