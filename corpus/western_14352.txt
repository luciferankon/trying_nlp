His evil female lawyer (Nana Bryant) covets the ranch and works in cahoots with Ford's long-lost nephew and a pack of killer dogs to get it. U.S. Marshal Roy Rogers puts an end to her plans. Lawyer Hattie Waters is after Thad Cameron's money. She tells him she has found his long lost nephew and has him sign a blank will. Then she has him killed and brings in a phony heir to collect. Marshal Roy Rogers arrives to investigate Thad's death and immediately becomes suspicious. Thad was reportedly killed by wolves but Roy realizes it was really dogs.
