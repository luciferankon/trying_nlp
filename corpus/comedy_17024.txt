Anita Karenová ('Truda Grosslichtová' (qv)) becomes the owner of the clothing company Karen that her father has bequeathed her on her 21st birthday. However she has no experience in running a business and she would like to acquire some on-the-job training beforehand. Thus she avails herself of the report of Pavla Holoubková ('Vera Ferbasová' (qv)) who has applied for a position at the company and she writes the recommendation herself. Under a new name she is taken on as a copy clerk in the branch under Jirí Hosek's management. Hosek ('Vladimír Borský' (qv)) falls in love with Anita without knowing who she really is.
