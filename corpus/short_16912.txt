We are all regularly posing to recording cameras without knowing or noticing. Banks travel agencies shops and public buildings; all of them are equipped with surveillance cameras; of course just for "our security". The question is why are these cameras there and whether the predetermined reasons are really justifying the surveillance of you and me. What is this surveillance for? Who is using this monitoring? Do the known told pretended reasons justify the constant surveillance of human beings? To question of monitoring people in the public areas (how far do they feel safe because of the increasing surveillance or does it work in the opposite way...) is so interesting as questioning the supervisors: "What do you want to see?"
