As the 21st century progresses humanity is on the brink of a revolution in pharmaceuticals that has the potential to free us from the scourge of hitherto incurable diseases. Whilst something of the frogs' hidden secrets has always been known in the east it's only recently that western science is beginning to understand the potential to medicine their chemical compounds can offer. But just as science is uncovering this bonanza frogs are suffering the biggest mass extinction since the demise of the dinosaur. If that's not worrying enough these unique creatures are considered to be valuable bio-indicators of the health of our planet. So is their demise an indication that we are also in peril? Though the state of the environment has never been worse a devastating cause for their ongoing extinction has been uncovered that has astounded scientists the world over. Croaking Frogs documents the race to understand the fall of the amphibians and the coming together of scientists and local communities to save one of the oldest species still existing on our planet.
