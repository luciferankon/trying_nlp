CNN takes a look at three stories from the U.S. drug war. The first examines the life of an undercover cop in Boston. The second looks at how international drug dealers are illegally buying valid U.S. passports. The third investigates the death of Edie Howsell in an Alabama county cell. She was placed in witness protection because her daughter was the sole witness in a New York City gang murder.
