Lone Star Productions did an exact remake of this one year later (line for line) with 'John Wayne (I)' (qv) changing only the name of the lead character. The simplified plot has two different gangs attempting to wrest control of valuable Oklahoma oil lands from an orphaned girlLucy Morrell ('Clarissa Woods' (qv)) who is aided in her fight by her adopted father Chris Morrell ('Buddy Roosevelt' (qv)).
