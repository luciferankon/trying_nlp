During Summer 2000 the mayor of the Greek island of Lesbos tried to ban 26 Lesbians from arriving on a package holiday from the UK; but he ended up biting off more than he could chew. This programme follows the love lust and laughs over the course of their holiday as the women drink dance and snog their way around the island. Despite being shadowed by the papparazi and some negative islanders nothing can stop our women from fighting for their right to party.
