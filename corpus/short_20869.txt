Nearly 75 years ago the Dust Bowl offered farmers here a valuable lesson: if their tillage practices failed to leave the soil covered it would be lost forever. Today most farmers in this region still grow cycles of wheat and fallow - essentially resting their soil for an entire year after each harvest to give it time to collect enough rainwater to produce another crop. While this wheat-fallow rotation helps farmers keep wheat yields consistent from year to year it also requires leaving the soil bare for up to 14 months at a time. That bare soil is subject to both wind and water erosion and loses nearly 75% of its water storage to evaporation and weeds.
