Female Haratins face double discrimination both as members of the 'slave caste' and because they are women. They face the threats of forced and/or early marriage (in order to maximise their child-bearing potential and increase their master's stock of slaves) lack of control of fertility sexual abuse or rape and trafficking into sexual exploitation which increase the dangers of severe maternal health problems and HIV/AIDS. Additionally children of slaves automatically become the property of their masters and can be rented out loaned or given as gifts in marriage. Haratin communities are largely unable to change their situation because there are enormous challenges in trying to overcome deep seated prejudices and a lack of political will to bring about fundamental change to a system from which the majority of the population (including the government legislature judiciary and police) benefit.
