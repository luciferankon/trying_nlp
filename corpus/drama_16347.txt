focuses on two brothers who murdered the wife and infant daughter of their younger brother. The killers claimed they were acting on orders from God consistent with their interpretation of a fundamentalist interpretation that goes back to the formation of Mormonism. The brothers were members of a splinter group called the School of Prophets which adhered to original tenets of the faith that included polygamy and a belief that true believers could speak directly with God. These were rooted as the faith grew to a mainstream appeal but the brothers remain convinced they were obeying God's command when they committed the heinous crime.
