Tommy the Barber in Edin NC not only cuts hair but collects a wide range of flags and golf balls. He's got almost 2500 stocked from floor to ceiling in his barber shop. But don't let that southern hospitality fool ya even though he doesn't know the worth of all his items he still drives a hard bargain. Bob and his business partner Mike are long time collector/dealers based in Pinehurst N.C. - the home of American golf. They've recently opened up a golf memorabilia shop and have invited Bob and Ryan to come scope out the inventory for their next auction. The Green Jacket Auction boys will have to bring their A game or they'll be in for more of a show and tell - then show and bring home.
