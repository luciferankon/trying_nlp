A knight takes leave of his sweetheart before going on a journey and while indulging in an affectionate farewell he pencils a small note which he places in her custody and in which he promises his sweetheart that he will neither drink flirt nor quarrel. He then starts upon his wanderings over the country land. Becoming very much fatigued he seats himself on a rock and begins to doze off. Suddenly he finds himself in a tavern where three men are drinking. They invite him to partake from the foaming steins but he thinks of his resolution and declines; but they press upon him so persistently that he finally takes a drink. As he does so one of the drinkers assumes the shape of the Devil and the knight flees from the scene. Going further on he finds himself in a crowd for which a street girl of the Carmencita type is dancing with a tambourine. When she stops he admires her beauty and after speaking to her chucks her playfully under the chin. As he does so she turns round and the knight is again with the Devil. Having now broken two vows the traveler realizes that he is in the Devil's hands but he is helpless; and when in going through a wood he becomes involved in an altercation with a stranger he forgets his third vow and drawing a rapier he fights a duel with the man. He fells his opponent with a mighty stroke and as the man lies before him on the ground the knight sees him gradually change into the jeering scoffing Devil. Angry at himself for having fallen tinder the influence of the Evil One he brandishes his sword as if to exterminate him but the excitement of the situation is too much for him and he suddenly wakes up to find himself sitting on the rock where he had fallen asleep. It had all been a dream.
