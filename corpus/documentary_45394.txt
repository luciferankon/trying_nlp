Follow the path of the sun on its annual cycle from the Equator across the northern hemisphere and into the South. Witness a world bursting with life as spring and summer follow the passage of the sun. Revealed in all their glory are the natural rhythms of life - the urge to breed to feed and to raise young - all driven by the sun the moon and the seasons across the world.
