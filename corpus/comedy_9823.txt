Country legend Mel Tillis "Green Acres" alum Tom Lester and silly man supreme Tim Conway provide a crash course in how not to hunt in this hilarious send up of the sporting life that lands the trio in the great outdoors. When good old boys Tillis and Lester enter a "Huntin' Buddies" contest they leave a trail of chaos and destruction in their wake. Enter game warden Conway and things go from bad to worse in the guys' backwoods misadventure. If ever there was a "How Not To Hunt" video this is it. Mel and Tom enter the "Huntin' Buddies" contest only to have chaos and destruction follow them....and Warden Tim Conway too. It's a hilarious romp through the woods that's sure to entertain the whole family.
