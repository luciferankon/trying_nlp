Travel up the Oregon Coast and around Washington State to visit twenty-two of the Pacific Northwest s most popular lighthouses. The awe-inspiring images were captured on the RED ONE Digital Cinema Camera at 4k and carefully down converted to 1080p for the highest possible quality video available on Blu-ray. The beautiful imagery is set to the music of Johnny Bregar. The program was shot during the summer and fall of 2009. Also included is the award winning animated short Big Buck Bunny. We went back to the original OpenEXR high dynamic range source files to create this brand new encode. Lighthouses of the Pacific Northwest is not narrated. It is stunning visuals set to relaxing music. Director: Stacey Spears
