In a household where no pets are allowed a dog in cahoots with his little boy master passes himself off as a stuffed animal. Formerly a stray Woofy and Antoine have forged a special bond which has lead to Antoine taking the dog home and claiming to have won a "stuffed animal" at school.Â  From that day on the dog has been living a secret life in his young master's bedroom. But for both dog and boy it's a dangerous game in a household where Antoine's mother as fussy a housekeeper as there has ever been has laid down the law : no animals allowed!
