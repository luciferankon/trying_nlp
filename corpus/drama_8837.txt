Set in 1936 in Poland. Zygfryd a handsome orphaned young circus acrobat with an introspective temperament is under the protection of circus owner Waldo and his wife. A rich intellectual recluse patron of the arts (and of young artists) stumbles into Zygfryd's heart- stopping act and offers him his friendship. He also opens up his cultural horizons and teaches him to consciously reflect on life. It all ends in tragedy when the boy finds that the circus life is no longer enough and falls during his act.
