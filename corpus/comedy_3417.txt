'Milan Ruzicka' (qv) uses uncompromising humor and simplified caricatures to develop a tale common in the Czech Republic in the beginning of nineties. A Czech-American ('Miroslav Donutil' (qv)) returns to the country of his birth after November 1989 to see to the restitution of family property. He runs into freeloaders con artists and other similar elements.
