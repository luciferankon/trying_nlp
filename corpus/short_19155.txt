In response to growing concerns about autonomous weapons a coalition of AI researchers and advocacy organizations commissioned this disturbing dystopian film. It depicts a disturbing future in which lethal autonomous weapons have become cheap and ubiquitous. This video was launched in Geneva where AI researcher Stuart Russell presented it at an event at the United Nations Convention on Conventional Weapons hosted by the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots.
