A school teacher gets transferred to a backward villagewhere people suffer from various abuses and troubles. Everyone becomes an ignorant to happiness as nothing works in their favour ever. Carrying his dark past along with himself the teacher teaches them the importance and strength of Ardaas ( Prayer ).
