In one Vojvodinian castle the preparations for the play that will be performed by members of the Association of the blind are in the process. The play is dedicated to the Jews from America who are supposed to come and visit the place of their ancestor's massacre in 1942 during a raid in Novi Sad. The plot was to be carried out according to the original stories of witnesses who have gone through this tragic event. However the initiators of the show manipulate the blind people in order to smuggle bombs for Albanian terrorists.
