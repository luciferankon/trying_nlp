We often don't know the people that are very close to us. Sometimes we have something that lives inside our own soul hidden. It comes out from time to time. Sometimes we are in conflict among ourselves with our own thoughts. We always calculate what we lose and what we gain. And we all have some Mental Strength that can be often referred to as Mental Disorder as well. We all can be good and healthy but... again we all might have some hidden scary mental disorders that might lead to something that nobody can ever imagine! Shahed the main Character of this story - could be a person like that.
