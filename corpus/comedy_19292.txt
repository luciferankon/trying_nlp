What do you do when you love music and music doesn't love you back? It's a question that haunts Walt (Jim Tavar√©) the owner of Essential Music an indie record store in the heart of the L.A. skinny-jeans district of Silver Lake. Walt's all too aware of how his punk-rock glory days are fast fading in the rear-view... even as he can't help recounting war stories to his much younger employees: Lysette (Kate Dalton) who has to contend with a parade of customers convinced she's the Record Store Girl of their dreams; Chris (Derek James) the lead singer of Troubled Meats a band poised for takeoff and maybe not just in Chris' mind; and well-meaning music nut Duane (Adam Weber) who's a little too fluent in Rock Critic for his own good. With a love of all types of music evident in every shot WARMED-OVER KRAUTROCK is a comedy for anyone who's ever spent too much time obsessing over playlists - and for anyone who's ever been driven crazy by that type of person too.
