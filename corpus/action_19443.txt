As either the War Mage or Sorceress in the campaign mode the player must attempt to defend up to three Rifts from an onslaught of orc armies that emerge from one or more doors in a given level. The orc armies arrive in waves between which the player is given time to recover and place additional traps. To defeat the orcs the player selects a number of traps spells and equipment from their Spellbook.
