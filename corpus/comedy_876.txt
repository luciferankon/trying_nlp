Its the story of a naive Peruvian native who goes to lima peru in order to gain fortune on her way back to her hometown she discovers that her (almost as she said it) husband has gone to lima in order to solve a problem with a building company that threatens to demolish her town and build an enormous hotel on top. on her travel she will find a little girl that serves as a company to her story giving her a (miracle) speech that is really important to the plot. so here are some of the most critical aspects of the film the actors were perivian --pop culture. which means that they have appeared in famous peruvian shows like : "al fondo hay sitio" and many other local actors despite the acting wasn't AAA its just bearable. the movie heavily relies on cringe in order to entertain the audience so much to being a little racist (just a little). the movie was based on the original 1999 show which was meant to actually be kinda racist but as said early its bearable. the green scene effect are obviously terrible but lets consider that the Peruvian movie industry its just starting and are relaying on people that don't have ANYTHING to do with the acting world less with movies like natalia malaga for those of you who don't know her she is the VOLLEYBALL FEDERATION MAIN TRAINES. what is she doing in a cringe movie? any way. the industry is good. I would give it 3 stars for the effort. its trying and failing.but trying.
