This award-winning cult masterpiece spins the story of Lazarus who is forced to face an ancient challenge in a win-or-die confrontation. In this elaborately spun 60-minute spoof a somewhat ordinary man (Lazarus) is blind-sided and gradually evolves into a force to be reckoned with. The perpetrator of the challenge Nick Safara uses a fighting force called "clobberers" against Lazarus throughout the movie and gets by with a little help from Eva the fortune teller and Nina his shapely female companion. The show culminates with a colorful choreographed fight scene between the two main characters.
