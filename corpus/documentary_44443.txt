Whale Like Me features Malcolm Wright African American conservationist and grand son of the famed author Richard Wright journeying to Japan to understand the Japanese attitudes towards whales. He enlists the aid of an old friend Hideki Fujii - although Hideki accepts the vital role of opening the doors of his culture to a foreigner he reveals that he himself is for whaling. The two challenge each other to explore their different cultural approaches to whales through direct investigation culminating in Malcolm living amongst coastal whalers experiencing their culture and activities first hand. Malcolm is but one man faced with an entire culture - how far will he get in his pursuit of mutual understanding and what will be the outcome for whales?
