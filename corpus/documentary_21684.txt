'Being Magdeburg' is a glimpse of the city of Magdeburg through the eyes of its many residents and visitors. The taxi driver who drives past her birth house as it is being demolished. The parish clerk who describes the advantages of having colorless windows in the cathedral. The mayor who is confronted with questions concerning shake ups in town planning Their statements which are often curt comments to a situation that sways between stagnation and transformation are combined with a tranquil camera and a point of view which at times includes dreamy animation. We see reflections in windows and unusual visions in which Magdeburg arises as a place of possibilities. The ambiguous historical legacy the great potential of a state capital and a city with open spaces ready for occupation echoes as a personal portrait of the filmmaker: an actor who in the 1990s lived in Magdeburg working at the Freien Kammerspielen.
