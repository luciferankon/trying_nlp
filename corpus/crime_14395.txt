Einar Bure and his fiancée Puck Ekstedt are invited to a wedding in the small town of Skoga. Outside the church they meet Christer Wijk chief of the national homicide investigation team with his mother Helena who invites them to stay in her house for a couple of days. Suddenly the bridegroom Joakim Kruse appears and informs the wedding guests that his bride Anneli Hassel hasn't arrived which means that the wedding is canceled. Early next morning Christer and Puck stumble upon the dead body of the bride lying at a lawn. They start investigating the murder and soon find out that a lot of people are lying. All of them are surely not involved in the homicide but are trying to hide other secrets that could cause disgrace in the small town. All evidences in the case seem to point at a recluse Mats Norrgĺrd who is found hanging dead at his cottage in the wood but Christer and Puck are quite sure that he isn't the murder. Meantime Einar and Puck are planning their own wedding. When Puck doesn't turn up at a preparatory meeting with the priest because she is too engaged in the murder mystery Einar believes that she doesn't love him anymore.
