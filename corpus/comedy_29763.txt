A farmer is furious when he sees a witch on his land and the authorities respond by sending him a well-meaning vicar - who recently finished a witch-hunting course. Two men are also provided on community service: a depressed anarchist who's forgotten today is his birthday; and a local delinquent whose girlfriend is the only volunteer to arrive. The vicar arms them and uses mystical techniques to prepare them against the witch before they go to the country in search of her blood. Upon arrival the dazed group set to work but their chaotic ways challenge the vicar's feeble attempts.
