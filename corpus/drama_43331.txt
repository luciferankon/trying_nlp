An Hungarian young man hides his real identity as baron Barinkay until he returns to his birthplace and claims the family properties now occupied by a clumsy pig dealer who has a beautiful daughter. The gypsy girl is not bad looking either and the gypsies are willing to help him recover his home and fortune. French version of Der Zigeunerbaron based on the Strauss operetta filmed at the same time with a different cast except for Wohlbr√ºck.
