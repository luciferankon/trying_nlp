Bon app√©tit. This month's edition of the popular TCM franchise "Friday Night Spotlight" is designed to make your stomach rumble with hunger - and occasionally growl in protest - as TCM presents films featuring iconic food scenes. They range from the glorious banquet of Babette's Feast (1987) to the lust-filled meal of Tom Jones (1963) and that queasy scene in Cool Hand Luke (1967) when Paul Newman consumes 50 boiled eggs in one sitting. This "Spotlight" is hosted by Anthony Bourdain the American chef author of such books as No Reservations: Around the World on an Empty Stomach (2007) and Medium Raw: A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and People Who Cook (2010) and the host of television shows including CNN's current Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America Bourdain gained hands-on experience by running a number of restaurants in his native New York City. He attained instant popularity with his best-selling book Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (2000) leading to other books and articles in such publications as The New York Times and The New Yorker. On television he has headed his own programs on the Food Network and the Travel Channel in addition to appearing as a guest on numerous other shows. Parts Unknown which premiered on CNN in April 2013 won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series and continues to showcase Bourdain's salty personality and his love of exotic food from various locales.
