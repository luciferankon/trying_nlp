Hosted by Dee Barnes of Fox TV's ''Pump It Up'' with acts ranging from established artists like Queen LaTifah Salt-N-Pepa and MC Lyte to newcomers like Tam Tam. A 75-minute extravaganza of live performances taped at the Ritz in New York this revue preaches self-reliance and demanding respect from guys even if that means as one rapper says ''kicking them in the balls.'' You see: Sometimes all a thing needs is a woman's touch.
