Dan Bell Will Krupinsky and Rick Serra bring their investigative skills and remarkably high tolerance for the disgusting back for this 15th addition to the popular Another Dirty Room series. Joined on this journey by Jake Williams of Bright Sun Films the guys are bringing their blacklights swabs and strong stomachs to Tampa FL to discover just how clean (or in this case incredibly dirty) the Regency Inn and Suites really are. And to say hello to a very large colony of roaches.
