A vote with jurors indicated by the couple and with the participation of the internet will choose the winning decoration. And the best: they only find out who won when they return home and find the space completely renovated. Would you risk the decoration of your dreams in a competition with the love of your life? "Reform of Couples" premieres on May 1st at 7:00 p.m. and airs daily.
