Fifty-year-old Sardinian-born Silvio - a lover of jazz music and karaoke shows - manages the "Stella d'Oro" boarding house. Built on the Swiss side of Lake Maggiore more than a hundred years ago the place has been accommodating less and less tourists and a few asylum seekers. But its days are numbered: it is threatened by a property restoration project for a new private housing estate. Its few remaining days depict the passing of life in a place of encounter for the stories and dreams of people coming from different locations and cultures.
