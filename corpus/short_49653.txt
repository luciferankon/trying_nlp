Commemorates the 101-year anniversary of Thomas Edison's "Pie Eating Contest" (1897) with an experimental video reenactment. A stroboscopic vomit sequence is converted from analogue to digital 101 times until little is left apart from a vague memory. Meanwhile the maker reflects on the increasing digitalization of the medium and prepares a new day's breakfast.
