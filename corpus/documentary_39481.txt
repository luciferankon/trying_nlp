1992 My mother Josƒçphe Cardin nicknamed Jo phoned me to tell me that she was to undergo surgery the following day. She said that I knew what to do if anything should happen to her. She died suddenly in the operation. I began to look for the answer to this question retracing my mother's history until her past was revealed. 1942 Jo high-school student in Paris was wearing a yellow star of David although she was not Jewish. She was arrested and immediately sent to the internment camp of Tourelles and then to Drancy.She have been all her life marked by what she saw. The film restores life to Jo and ask us about commitment.
