Mother's Milk is a dark comedy short about dueling the dueling mothers of Victor Miller the screenwriter for the original Friday the 13th movies. In this cathartic tale Victor is alternatively controlled by his twisted mother Margaret for whom he can never be good enough and nurtured by his dream mother Billie who acts as his salve. As Victor goes throughout his day his mother chastises him for everything from making a sandwich to going to the bathroom. A muse-like mother then appears and acts as a nourishing guide. The battle between the mothers makes up the heart of this surreal dark comedy.
