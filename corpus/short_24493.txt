Father-to-be Miguel Francis-Santiago conducts a two-week experiment he plans to walk in his wife Kristina's shoes in a bid to understand how pregnancy really feels. To do that he dons a heavy tummy-suit in which he'll work drive do household chores and even sleep. Miguel is determined to strive to replicate what women have to go through before childbirth.
