A family's place in the wilderness outside of time; free-range animals and children junk and nature all within the most sublime landscape. The work aims at an idea of freedom which is reflected in the hand-processed Scope format but is undercut with a sense of foreboding. There's no particular story; beginning middle or end just fragments of lives lived rituals performed.
