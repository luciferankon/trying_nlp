In 1969 insurance salesman Jimmy 'Tubby' Baker and secretary Enid are among those meeting for a televised reunion at the Manchester Free Trade hall where thirty years earlier as school children they were part of the choir who made a record of 'Nymphs and Shepherds Come Away.' Tubby and Enid are drawn together in reaction against the snobbish organizer Frank and his wife who try to impress them by taking them to the Berni inn and Tubby wants to date Enid but she is having an affair with her married boss in the belief that he will leave his wife for her. Tubby recalls how as young Jimmy his widowed mother was disapproving of his singing in the choir and it was down to the Bible-quoting Great War veteran crippled Mr Kirkby assistant to choir mistress Gertrude Riall that he was able to take part. Now he believes he should take a leaf out of his determined younger self's book and be bold convincing Enid that her lover will never leave his wife and that they are made for each other years after that day when they sang.
