Days before the annual opening of Slaughter on Second Street Owensboro's premiere haunted attraction a tragedy befalls one of their own. Despite pleas from the manager Buck Masters the attraction is shut down until the mystery is solved. In his frustration Buck devises a plan to get the haunt back on its feet and make some extra money while he's at it. Playing on the rumors that the attraction may in fact be haunted Buck brings in paranormal investigators to prove the rumors true. The investigator's arrival is met with the feeling that something isn't right but it's just another job...Or so they think! An unfriendly encounter with the building's maintenance man Mr. Jenkins makes the team realize that the history of the building is far darker than they could have ever imagined and they may actually be visiting one of Owensboro's most haunted sites. Locked in overnight along with Buck they begin their investigation which becomes interrupted when three volunteers appear from the dressing room amidst their goodbyes for the season they had worked so hard on. As the night goes on the volunteers begin falling victim to fatal accidents that may or may not be supernatural. It is then that the investigators must solve the mystery of Slaughter on Second Street. Who will survive and who will die trying?
