After a fight with his boss and wife a depressed Welsh taxi driver runs off with the company's weekly takings. Only after he's escaped does he discover that he's stolen a very small amount of money. Instead of a trip to Paris he ends up on a coach trip to Ireland - before running out of cash and begging to be arrested and sent home. Unfortunately Ireland is another country - and he hasn't committed a crime there.
