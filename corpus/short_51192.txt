Two shepherds meet in a house where Glenn Gould is practicing a Chopin Study by Leopold Godowsky. The first shepherd touches Gould's shoulder who doesn't notice. The concept of Cordelia (a character from Kierkegaard's "The Seducer's Diary") suddenly appears while the two shepherds are talking and the youngest is measuring a carp in an aquarium. The concept of Cordelia questions the shepherds about Gould's presence in the house and the strange power of their touch.
