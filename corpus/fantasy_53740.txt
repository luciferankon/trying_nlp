Set in medieval times Evil Witch Tarusha curses the town and sends dark shards straight toward the Moon. In this universe the Moon is the binding force of the Earth and without it their precious world will be torn apart (quite literally). You have an hour to collect the 3 pieces of the moon and repair it. Do not fret; that hour can be extended by praying at certain points in the game. The Hero of this story is named Lucinda. She is a young Goddess of Water. Lucinda will be accompanied by the Kingdom's best Knight; Markus.
