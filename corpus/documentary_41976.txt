The film shows twelve days in the life of Jacek Sroka. The story is based on the diary or rather an anti-diary of the artist mixing the artistic with the intimate; distance with proximity; the imagined with the supposed. The world of the artist's paintings and his personal life permeate each other while privacy in his work gains universal value. Language of the film - its "third protagonist" - oscillates between documentary narrative (the story about the pictures) and magical realism (compelling animations) finding its own expression rich and surprisingly broad: we follow the camera through the nooks and crannies of the house the studio - and the artist's imagination.
