In this new work by Marie Chouinard the company's ten dancers execute variations on the exercise of freedom. Often the dancers appear on points: on one two and even four at a time. In a spectroscopy of the gesture we also see them using different devices - crutches rope prostheses horizontal bars and harnesses - which at times liberate their movements at others fetter it and at still others create it.
