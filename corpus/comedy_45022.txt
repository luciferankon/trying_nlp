As if it wasn't bad enough that Summer married a man named Ken and went from being a dignified McClain to becoming an inglorious Gertz or that she was plagued with a best friend who had a taunting personality that made nails on a blackboard seem serene and calm or that her favorite guru dietitian on her extra-favorite TV show was recommending salad for breakfast instead of blueberry muffins and certainly not to mention the fact that her cat Muffin seems to have of late developed some sort of detachment disorder-rendering the animal at best demure and at worst hostile-now a ring of a doorbell and enter Janis...an escaped prisoner from the local correctional facility who is desperately "requesting" a sanctuary and some time to think. Unfortunately...at knife point.
