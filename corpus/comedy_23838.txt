An alien spaceship lands in a Tel Aviv neighborhood a Mohel comes packed with a butcher's knife an ATM starts speaking in English customers are offered a shaving cream cake and a random huge breasted pedestrian woman is being fooled into audition topless right on the spot and then proceed to donate her "talents" for a fake pomelo fruit commercial. All that and more in Yehuda Barkan's second candid camera movie.
