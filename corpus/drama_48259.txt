When a rising Chinese diplomat arrives at his new post he is put in charge of suppressing Falun Gong in North America. But the more he learns the less he wants to do and as old assumptions turn upside down he is forced to choose between the Chinese Communist Party and his sense of right and wrong. That decision gets even harder when it becomes obvious that his wife and daughter can't escape the consequence of whatever choice he makes. Encirclement is a fact-based story that combines several actual events into a dramatic tale of conscience and corruption.
