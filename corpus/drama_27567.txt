Three different episodes with the common nexus of expressing how a situation that seems normal ends up in an outbreak of violence: a father actor of renown and owner of a luxurious mansion who fears losing his daughter to an American officer; an adulterous husband owner of an extensive estate where he breeds fighting bulls who feels cheated to find that his wife has also been unfaithful to him; a young American traveler across Spanish lands who decides that his trip and that of his companions should not continue.
