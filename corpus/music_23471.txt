The "Grand Ole Opry" represented television's second attempt to present country music performances at the famous Grand Ole Opry this time a lasting success on cable TV's The Nashville Network. The program featured live performances of country music stars from established stars and legendary performers to the rising up-and-comers every Saturday night from the Grand Ole Opry House (the Opry's home since 1974). Initially a 30-minute series the show expanded to 60 minutes in 1987 adding an introductory segment called "Opry Backstage"; the 30-minute segment (aired before that week's Opry performances) featured backstage interviews. The Grand Ole Opry's radio program dates back to 1925 performing country music on Saturday nights from the historic Ryman Auditorium and later the Grand Ole Opry House. The radio program has been carried nationwide on WSM-AM (650 AM Nashville) since 1939 and is likely to remain there for many years to come.
