The financial collapse the political instability and the family relations are placed into the spotlight as the documentary is trying to discover "what's in the head of GoldenDawners who pose as victims" of the system. Golden Dawn "never hid" its ideology. Its influence in the polls might have been almost nonexistent previously but the compatibility of this ideology with unshakable beliefs in Greece - cultivated by many clergymen and most of the Media but also by family and political system - is the fertile ground on which the organization flourishes. The director is looking into the matter from a personal viewpoint having dedicated many years and another two television productions in approaching the neo-Nazi party which has taken the third position in Greece's political system after three decades of obscure but bloody activity.
