Horatio Nullbuilt and Crispin Horatiobuilt live alone in the desert fixing up their ship before a rogue robot comes along and steals their power core. They then traverse the desert and make it into the city of Metropol and from there they get into much more trouble than they anticipated. Much of the game and story are determined by the player's decisions so it takes any number of turns upon entering the city.
