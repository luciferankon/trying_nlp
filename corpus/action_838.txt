This film exposes the type of things people are forced to do to survive in the ghetto . 'SOCIETY REJECTS US BUT THE SYSTEM MADE US WHO WE ARE IN THE GHETTO THERE IS NO 9-5 SO WE ALL GOT DO WHAT WE GOT TO DO TO SURVIVE". Not every one in the ghetto choices a life of crime and violence but they have kids to feed and families depending on them so selling drugs and violence's is there only source of income.
