One man's trash is another man's treasure. Especially for Mr Koh Ah Koon who tends secondhand goods at Singapore's oldest flea market - Sungei Road. Presently Sungei Road faces imminent demolition by 2017 to make way for a train station. This leaves more than 500 street hawkers mostly pioneer generation elders distressed as they are highly dependent on selling secondhand goods as a source of income. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Especially for Mr Koh Ah Koon who tends secondhand goods at Singapore's oldest flea market - Sungei Road. Presently Sungei Road faces imminent demolition by 2017 to make way for a train station. This leaves more than 500 street hawkers mostly pioneer generation elders distressed as they are highly dependent on selling secondhand goods as a source of income. To alleviate the situation Mr Koh and a few other hawkers set up the Association for the Recycling of Second Hand Goods to petition for the continuation of the market. As president he acts as an intermediary between the hawkers and the government. Although numerous attempts have been made the odds are still stacked against them. But Mr Koh continues to fight to save a dying landmark and source of living. He is joined by a close aide Mr Lee Peng Hon an independent heritage activist who sees the removal of Sungei Road as a lost of a part of his memory. Sungei Road is just an example of how the pursuit for development has led to the loss of heritage an invaluable fabric that distinguishes us as a society. Is the price we pay for convenience really worth it?
