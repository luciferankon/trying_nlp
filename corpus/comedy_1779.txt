A group of rather slap dash builders are rather imaginative at solving what problems come their way. Whatever it is that doesn't fit the picture it will be made fit in no time. This approach works equally well with a tightfisted contractor or the remains of an illegal foreign worker on the site. And then they're saddled with an arrogant student of architecture who is doing his work experience with them - and who shows interest in the pretty daughter of one of them.
