Welcome to Holland profiles Dutch people who are very actively involved in helping immigrants during their integration process. In a cheerful frank and sometimes ironic way the programme highlights the developing interaction between different cultures. The programme tries to focus mainly on the human and positive aspects of a multicultural society not on the abuses or political issues.
