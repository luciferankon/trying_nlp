Residue is a 2-dimensional platform adventure set against the fascinating real-life background of the Aral Sea brought to life through months of research and painstaking attention to detail. Through gameplay as much as through dialogue (fully voiced by a cast of experienced stage actors) we want to tell the story of the people who tried to save a world and what it did to them. It is at once a warm and a cold story about our compulsion to be important and make a difference but also about how love can melt ambition. We've spent a lot of time on this one during our university years and are finally getting ready to release it this fall.
