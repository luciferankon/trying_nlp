The U.S. government is holding immigrant women and children in private prisons in South Texas. This practice is new and in direct response to an increase in the arrival of asylum-seeking families from Central America in 2014. Persons of faith and persons of conscience are organizing to provide outreach to these families and to end this disturbing practice. This short film centers around a protest in Dilley Texas and explores the ways that the community is coming together to provide assistance to these women and children.
