A voyeur (Masatoshi Nagase) secretly photographs a mysterious woman (Rie Miyazawa) from his stark apartment which faces hers. He becomes transfixed as he witnesses her go through her daily routines and stacks videotape after videotape of the footage he takes. One day while following her he comes across a bloody car wreck in which the victim crashed his luxury car into a guardrail. In the crowd of witnesses he notices the woman he's been following and inadvertently releases the shutter of his camera snapping photographs of her reaction. Later he hands over a bag of videotapes to his client (Koji Yakusho) and asks him who the woman is. He is becoming totally obsessed with her and their paths will soon cross again. Movie title "Gelatin Silver Love" is in reference to the gelatin-silver process a photographic process used with currently available black-and-white films and printing papers.
