Set in 1855 in Wyoming Territory it is a tale of two families whose fates become intertwined when the son of Swedish settlers is wrongly hanged by an Irish-American rancher who is hell-bent of putting an end to the cattle rustling that is depleting his stock of cattle. This initial wrong deed sets in train a course of events that will lead to more deaths the eventual humbling of the Irish-American rancher (Matt McArdle) and the joining of the two families in an ultimate act of forgiveness and contrition. But before this happens the McArdles are fractured and split apart by the tensions between the three sons of Matt McArdle -Patrick Sean and Seamus.
