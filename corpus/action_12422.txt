The plot can be outlined as such: A young man who has always been into bull riding finds himself in a troublesome time in his life where he is getting discouraged and not being able to focus on what he's trying to accomplish. Through self-proclaimed divine intervention this bull rider meets a group of surfers who teach him how to surf to get his mind off of things and to focus on the original feeling he had growing up as to why he began bull riding; to have fun. While his time of learning to surf is ending they all agree that they must trust in god's plan and have faith in Jesus in order to gain inner peace to be able to focus on their career with most attention given to the bull rider and his journey to regain his focus and embrace his faith to become better at what he does.
