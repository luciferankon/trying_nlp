A documentary that chronicles the rise and fall of NBA superstar Antoine Walker's fame and fortune. Antoine Walker's story speaks for itself. Amassing over $110 million during a 13-year NBA career Walker went from being an NBA All-Star and World Champion to facing felony charges stemming from gambling debt in Las Vegas. However vice was not his sole enemy; his generosity to more than 70 family members and friends evenly contributed to the drain of his fortune. Now successfully navigating bankruptcy Antoine is on a mission to educate others on financial literacy using his own story as a warning and an effective platform for others to learn from his mistakes. The documentary is the first of many planned projects by "It's The Comeback Kids LLC" that will feature individuals working to better the lives of others through charity.
