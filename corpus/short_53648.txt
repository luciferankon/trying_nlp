His Satanic Majesty seems here to be in a very good humor and performs some marvelous tricks in magic. We first see him dancing around a large urn then passing his wand over it flames are seen to shoot up and out steps a beautiful maiden from a roaring fire. She brings a bevy of pretty girls out of space and we see them all revolving in midair and forming many marvelous pictures. Flaming vases next appear out of which come a number of graceful girls; others join them and they form a grand ensemble and dance an extremely artistic ballet. Finally they all disappear and old Satan is on the scene again doing a light fantastic with the first maiden. After this he juggles flaming torches till he goes up in a gush of fire and we then see the group of girls again going through many beautiful dances.
