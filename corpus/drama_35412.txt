Through seven bottles of cursed wine we follow the journey of Valentina a beautiful artist living in Berlin. With a sordid history of sexual and physical abuse and having been caught in the arms of her female lover by her wealthy overbearing mother Val is forced to make a choice: to live a "normal" life or be forever cut off - financially and emotionally. She concedes to her mother's ultimatum and pursues a heterosexual relationship to appease her only to catch her new boyfriend in bed with another man. Her inability to cope with her life triggers her repressed male alter-ego to emerge and take over.
