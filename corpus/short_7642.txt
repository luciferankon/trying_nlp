Marianne Loewe a recently divorced rather uptight college professor is undergoing analysis with the elderly Dr. Anya Zurmer a strict Freudian. About a month into Marianne's analysis Dr. Zurmer suddenly chooses to abandon the rigid rules of psychoanalysis which have always guided her work. Marianne's relationship to Dr. Zurmer then becomes totally unorthodox and baffling to her and for a while to us. "Psychoanalysis Changed My Life" explores the path of this evolving relationship and the intriguing reasons for Dr. Zurmer's sudden change of method - and of heart.
