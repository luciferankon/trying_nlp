Professional quarterback Terry Dunne (Neville Brand) is hospitalized with an unknown but debilitating illness. When he is diagnosed with a serious but perhaps operable brain tumor Dunne decides that his team's life insurance policy makes him more valuable dead than alive (but unable to participate in sports). Can Dr. Casey convince this talented well-educated and intelligent man that he is worth more than money AND that life after football may be more rewarding to his family than a financially secure but fatherless home?
