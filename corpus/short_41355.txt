A black man and a white woman enter a barbershop. The man tries embracing the woman who pushes him away. They sit down the woman to have her hair dyed the man to have his face shaved. The hair stylists are distracted by a lovely maid and accidentally turned the black man white and the white woman black. Now it's the white man ignoring the black woman.
