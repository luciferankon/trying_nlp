This documentary tells the story of a rebel people - the Mascogos known in the United States as the Black Seminoles. This community is descended from escaped slaves who made common cause with the Seminole Indians of Florida. Filmed on both sides of the border this video documents the complex history of people of African descent caught between national boundaries and the efforts of their descendants to maintain their culture.
