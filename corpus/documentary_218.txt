Turtle Beach is a story of success against the odds in a fight to save a sea turtle nesting beach from development. In Turkey in the mid-eighties new tourist facilities were being built along the coastlines at breakneck speed. When former nightclub singer June Haimoff heard of plans to build a holiday village on the beach at Dalyan she decided to speak up for the endangered species caretta caretta. Dalyan's sea turtles became an international cause celebre as the landmark campaign to save the beach gathered momentum. It was the first time that conservation had been considered in Turkey's rush to develop economically and the sea turtles became powerful symbols of a new awareness in the country.
