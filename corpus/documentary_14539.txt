The paradox of the successful worldly conductor who makes the centuries-old world of classical music accessible and the intimate composer feels rather like standing on a delicately balanced pile of rocks. And staying there until the rehearsals are concluded and the concert is about to begin. The conductor goes on stage and moves in front of the orchestra. He lifts his hands in the air - ready to embody music. In his documentary 'Brossé' Jacques Servaes gives us a behind-the-scenes look at the day-to-day life of conductor and composer Dirk Brossé.
