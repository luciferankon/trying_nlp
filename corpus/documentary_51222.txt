NEON celebrates the beauty colour and vibrant history of the neon sign from an international perspective as we face a world where it will soon be lost and superceded by L.E.D. signage. Neon is 100 years old and the craft and construction has changed very little making neon one the greenest forms of light ever produced and an amazing and enduring force of colour and light in the visual landscapes of our lives.
