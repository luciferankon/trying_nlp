This story of two teenagers on the edge of change is really the saga of what it means to be deaf in contemporary Australia. It is an exploration of a culture with its own language and history. Ignored dismissed secret - it has persisted and grown through centuries and shows us a different way of communicating of knowing each other of being human. Bethany Scott and the school are its custodians. WELCOME 2 MY DEAF WORLD is an insight into their world.
