When a film crew moves into an abandoned psychiatric hospital with a shadowy past to shoot a low budget horror film they get more than they bargained for. The late nights and lack of sleep begin to take a toll and the longer this crew works the more the leaky wet building seems to be coming back to life feeding off its new inhabitants. As the shoot wears on members of the crew exhibit increasingly strange behavior leaving those still sane realizing they need to get out of this place before they too succumb to the building's infectious hold the only problem the old hospital is not ready to let them go.
