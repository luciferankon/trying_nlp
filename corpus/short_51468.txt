The Turtle is a journey of the body and the mind in dialog with nature art fashion and music. The Turtle seeks to capture that element most fundamental to the human soul. The Turtle's journey is simultaneously death and rebirth; the void that is that moment between existence and nonexistence. The Turtle invites us to share a part of ourselves and if we do it shares back with us a new part we may not have previously known. The Turtle's pain is our pain but The Turtle's victory is our victory. The Turtle simply put is life.
