Equal parts "The Newsroom" and "The Colbert Report" "Lady Business " mockuments the making of a satirical women's news show (airing monthly for biological reasons) while offering hilarious and scathing socio-political commentary through the actual broadcast show: "Lady Business: News On The Rag." Emmy Award winner Michael Cervieri is the executive producer of Lady Business in association with the Future Journalism Project. Rebecca Whitehurst and Jenny Grace co-produce and co-write the series.
