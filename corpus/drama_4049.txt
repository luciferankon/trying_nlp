A wealthy blind man is determined to build a cricket pavilion as a memorial to his dead son who was killed in battle in World War II. Not long before the dedication ceremony is to be held the son shows up; it turns out that he wasn't killed in battle but deserted and has become a blackmailer and a killer. He wants to get some money to "start a new life" but his blind father senses that something is wrong and sets out to find out what's going on.
