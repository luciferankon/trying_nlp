Responding to a threatened 'homeland' and 'security' in urban centers 'REGARD' plays with visual impressions of consciousness cognizance and surveillance in the mechanized urban environment. The film encounters jeopardy inherent as forms of transit weave sinuous paths through the city. A well-intentioned vulnerability emerges in the irony of 'anti-suicide nets' guarding a viaduct. A callaiedescopic mood of multiple exposures and 'double 8' / 16mm cross-formatting enables the small frames to fade in and out leaving the 16mm frame moving between background and foreground. A pair of eyes transmits ambivalent feelings of responsibility or oppression. Urban sounds merge with Beethoven's angst.
