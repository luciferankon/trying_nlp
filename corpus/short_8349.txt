ADRI√ÅN and ANDREA have been linked from the very moment they were born. A weird optical deformity makes them see the world in an incomplete but complementary way. They both know of each other's existence since they are treated by the same ophthalmologist SOPHIE and have been fantasying from their early days about finding "their other half".
