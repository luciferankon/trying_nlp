This Chicago-made video centers on a support group for gay men of color; the six members discuss barebacking fidelity bisexuality etc. This is the second installment in a series funded in part by the Chicago Department of Health intended to promote HIV awareness. The educational agenda results in some stiff moments ("But why should I get an HIV test?" "Well let me tell you four good reasons...") but the talented actors do a good job of selling the material and codirectors Sharon Zurek and Lora Branch strike a nice balance between didacticism and drama. By the cliff-hanger ending I cared enough to want to know what happened next. 60 min.
