On Simon's 29th birthday his father Mogens who has not been part of his and his older brother Jens' lives for many years suddenly turns up - declaring that he wants to give him a sports car. Mogens is mentally ill and has been in and out of hospital for years and as he becomes more and more agitated and violent Jens has to take him back to the hospital. However Mogens manages to talk Jens into helping him find the car. For one day and one night the two of them drive around Copenhagen looking for the car and the trip becomes a moving odyssey where father and son will finally get to know one another. Mogens is an imaginative person. Sometimes a little too much in which case he has on occasion been admitted to a mental hospital just to ease the pressure a little. He hasn't seen his family for years but one day he turns up at a family reunion hosted by his former wife and two adult sons. They however do not share his enthusiasm. Soon one of his sons Jens has to escort his father back to the hospital. But perhaps because Jens has inherited a little of his father's runaway imagination he takes pity on him even as he keeps rambling on about a red sports car he has bought as a present. The two head out on a wild goose chase that leaves Jens gasping for air.
