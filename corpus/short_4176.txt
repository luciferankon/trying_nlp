This film centers around the friendship of a not so young southern rapper and childhood friend turned Pastor. Vastly different paths with very different outcomes. The odd man out isn't always black and white. As Ya' Boy Hardheaded pursues his rap career in the style of old school he must have thick skin to tolerate the judgements of Robert Cash who is neither religious nor empathetic  although he lives the life of a young successful mega church pastor (a dream of Cash's late older brother and not his own). Ya boy Hardheaded has an answer to Cash's criticism in the form of a one man show but the problem is will anyone show up?
