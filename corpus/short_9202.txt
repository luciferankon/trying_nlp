A visit to a barbershop the place where men go to relax gossip and trade old stories and jokes. It's a place of the latest gadgets too. Then using a photo on the wall as a taking-off point the film hearkens back to a turn-of-the century tonsorial parlor. There a shave and a haircut are two bits. Beards and sideburns are trimmed special brushes help keep hair from falling out and for 30 minutes a man can relax in a mohair chair that cost the barber $20 installed. In the back a traveler can take a bath for 20 cents. The stories and jokes seem to be the same - only the prices have changed.
