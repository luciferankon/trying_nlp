Both Soldier Ride and Welcome to Soldier Ride the Film began in 2004 when Chris Carney a bartender at The Stephen Talkhouse in Amagansett NY decided to ride his bike for charity. With the support of Talkhouse owner Peter Honerkemp and Talkhouse promoter Nick Kraus Chris completed a 4000 mile coast-to-coast bicycle ride raising over $1 million in support of The Wounded Warrior Project a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to help injured service members aid and assist one another. In 2005 Chris was joined by two soldiers who were injured serving in Iraq: Staff Sergeant Heath Calhoun - a double leg amputee and Staff Sergeant Ryan Kelly - a single leg amputee - to ride again raising community awareness and meeting fellow veterans along the way. This is their story.
