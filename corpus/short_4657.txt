Pigan brinner! ("Maid on fire!") is a "modern silent short" shot in black/white 35 mm with the hand cranked camera Path√© from 1914 (actually the same camera used by D.o.P. Julius Jaenzon for "Phantom Carriage") telling the story of a Maid that slaves in a Swedish family high-etc kitchen in the year of 2008 serving some twin brats a hungry Nosferatu-teenager and a father "dying" in a cold. All tensed up she suddenly starts to burn and SELFCOMBUST!... Maid on fire! is a torch in the Swedish debate about maids.
