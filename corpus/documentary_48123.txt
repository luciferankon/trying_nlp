Among day care facilities for elementary school students Tsubasa Club in Sapporo is a unique place. Children with and without disabilities play together after school dancing folk dances spinning tops playing kendama. Tumbling around in total disorder in the tiny space their brimming energy and their egalitarian sense of association with each other make this short film a revelation.
