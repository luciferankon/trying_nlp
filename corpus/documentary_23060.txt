What would it be like if Hermes the Trickster god of the ancient Greeks or Coyote the mythological figure of the Zuni of the American Southwest were to come back to life today? Well see for yourself in 'Higher and Better: The Ballad of Orchard Grove.' The effects of yesterday's actions undeniably ripple through the present and we ignore history at the fabled price of repeating it. Set in the long ago year of 2008 'Higher and Better' chronicles the experiences of a motley cast of highly individualistic characters as they organize to fight the forced eviction of over 50 families and 400 individuals during the height of the Great Recession the worst economic downturn since the cataclysmic convulsions that began to envelop the world in the 1930s. Drawing on an unexpectedly deep reservoir of humor fortitude and determination experience and empathy the residents of Orchard Grove Mobile Home Park in Boulder Colorado - some of whom are literally fighting for their lives - draw on some of the deepest parts of the individual human psyche to confront some of the darkest parts of our collective human experience. Funny and enraging uplifting yet expressive of deep sorrow and suffering 'Higher and Better: The Ballad of Orchard Grove' uses the events of recent years to provide an illuminating depth of context for some of the events that are now spotlit on the national and world stage. Buckle up ladies and gentlemen turbulence ahead...
