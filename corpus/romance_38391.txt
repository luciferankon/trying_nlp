A woman who works at the Prado Museum in Madrid is obsessed with a centuries-old Flemish painting. The painting depicts a girl playing the piano observed by a man whom the woman imagines is her teacher and lover. She firmly believes that she is the girl in the painting and that a stranger she just met is the man.
