The original game posted by Obscure Horror Corner features walking down monochromatic corridors while various audio samples are played and looped over each other. Audio in the game leans heavily on recordings of interviews with various murderers such as Charles Manson. The game also depends heavily on distorted or reversed audio of such interviews or musical clips. While the player controls their character through the hallways images may intermittently display taking up the entire screen and preventing the player from progressing any further until the image automatically closes a few seconds later. Most of the images seem to reference child abuse especially people indicted in Operation Yewtree such as images of Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris. Other images include people convicted or accused of murder such as Japanese murderer Tsutomu Miyazaki and political figures such as former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The only other "characters" in the game are children who simply stand in one place and do not move or interact with the player at all. In the final video posted by Obscure Horror Corner one of these children does begin to follow the player causing "contact damage" to the player. Since the player has no means of self-defense or any ability to heal damage the player will inevitably die at this point in the game.
