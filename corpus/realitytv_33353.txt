A senior lecturer in psychology at Newcastle University oversees the planning and construction of a small remote community of static caravans in a Dorset valley which will be used to house five groups of neighbours from hell for four weeks. The groups consist of students noisy neighbours tearaway kids dog lovers and a lone busybody. The groups must share their restricted water and electric supplies with each other and as a trust exercise must keep all their food in one store. The social experiment will ultimately determine whether or not the groups can learn to live together in harmony through teamwork and community spirit.
