A youth enters a caf√© and while there he hears the Merry Widow waltz played for the first time and like a great many more went into raptures over the beautiful melody. He straightway goes to a music store and buys a copy of the famous waltz and he is so much taken up with it that he forgets everything else and goes along the street humming the air and much to his surprise and amusement he sees two policemen on their beat start to dance it. He is passing a house and hears a girl playing it on her piano and the temptation is too much for him and he proceeds to dance taking a lamp post for a partner. Next he is passing a street piano that is playing the air and a horse attached to a carriage starts to trip the light fantastic to its alluring strains. Finally he reaches his room and sits down to the piano to try it over and before he has proceeded far everything in the room is dancing around at a great rate. Then to his surprise the piano starts to move about and as he keeps on playing he is swinging around in mid air still strumming on the instrument.
