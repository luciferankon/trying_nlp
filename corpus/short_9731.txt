Northwest artist Donald Fels creates innovating and compelling work that explores trade culture economics and change. His art tells stories promotes discussion and offers new perspectives to ponder. He recently traveled to India to work with commercial signboard painters on a series of large-scale paintings that examine how trade impacts cultures and populations beyond the simple exchange of goods.
