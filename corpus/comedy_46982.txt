In the 80's "Howlin' Hank" Stevens was on top of the radio heap in Los Angeles. Then all of a sudden he disappeared and fell off the grid. Twenty years later he emerges running a broken down radio station in a small North Texas town. The station isn't much but it's HIS all his and he is about to lose it. If it's not one it's another. KDIL needs an upgrade mainly a new radio transmitter. He and his quirky disc jockeys must raise more donations for the homeless shelter in town than the new corporate radio station that just moved in or they'll lose the radio-thon. The prize is $100000 and that is exactly what the gang needs not too mention if they lose the contest they lose their broadcast license! Watch as the DJ's of Comanche Springs very own KDIL "The Dillo FM" do whatever it takes to win including wooing Dallas' most popular radio personality Mojo Watson into the fold!
