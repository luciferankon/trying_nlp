A young Harry Potter fan lives in Ras Al Khaimah and works at a mosque. One day he decides to go and watch a Harry Potter movie. Unfortunately the movie is no longer showing in the theatre in Ras Al Khaimah and he has to travel to Dubai to watch it. At the same time he has to be back in time at the mosque to announce the Azan (the call to prayer).
