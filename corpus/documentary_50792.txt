In October 1952 the British government declared a State of Emergency in Kenya. Its object: the defeat of "Mau Mau." In the war that followed fewer than 40 of Kenya's 40000 white settlers were killed while more than 15000 Africans lost their lives and hundreds of thousands more were arrested and subjected to a humiliating and often brutal process of "rehabilitation." But what was Mau Mau? A movement based according to the British Colonial Secretary on a "perverted nationalism and a sort of nostalgia for barbarism"? Or the Land Freedom Army an organized political and military response to repression and armed aggression? Using newsreel and previously inaccessible archive footage and drawing on interviews with participants on both sides Mau Mau examines the myth and the reality of Africa's first modern guerrilla war.
