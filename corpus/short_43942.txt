Layers is not only about two locals talking about themselves as artists but also talking about the people and experiences that helped influence their art in ways that built them up. While both of these artists use layering techniques within their work to convey their messages they also speculate how everyone's lives are made up of layers when it comes to the different people in their lives the backgrounds in which they grew up and the growth they've experienced.
