Loretta Gutman is a 35 year old kidult who hasn't quite got her life together. Still hung up on her soon-to-be ex husband and currently living on her sister's sofa Loretta lives like a reckless teenager. She drinks too much smokes too much hates her job and has no desire to have children - and now that her conservative lawyer husband has left her she's also miserable and lonely. However when she meets a like minded man-child who she accidentally gets hitched to on a drunken night in Vegas Loretta is forced to question what (and who) it is she really wants.
