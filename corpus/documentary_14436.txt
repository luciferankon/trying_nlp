When the Arab Spring came to Syria the rebellion chanted about freedom dignity influence. To Syrian/Norwegian director Nizam Najar this was obviously a very legitimate offset. Who would oppose this? Who could oppose removing Assad from power? Indeed a noble cause. The peaceful demonstrations were met by brutal force and a few years into the civil war that followed the rebellion was stuck. Nizam returns to Aleppo where he was born to find out why the rebels still have not won the war.
