Karl Achilles has been working at the Bitterfeld chemical plant ever since he helped build it up in 1945. Now he is 65 years old and the time has come for him to retire. The movie depicts his last day at work and allows for an exemplary glimpse into the working conditions of the former German Democratic Republic as well as into the head of a dedicated worker whose time has come to make room for the next generation.
