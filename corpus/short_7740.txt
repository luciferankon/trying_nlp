As the post-modern reality of a transpersonal psychology (an approach combining Eastern mysticism and Western rationalism) begins to emerge in today's philosophical views the world has been turning to sacred doctrines that shed light on ancient wisdom. The Vernal Equinox or the first day of spring is cherished theologically in many devout practices through out the Universe (Hinduism Buddhism The Chinese Religious Complex Judaism Christianity and Islamism). Two main ideas surrounding this day are 're-birth' & 'fertility' themes that discoursed around 3500 B.C. when the Babylonians symbolized the New Year with the Sun moving north across the celestial equator. Equitility contemplates what still remains in our passive minds during this day an unconscious serenity that has been linked to recurring patterns in our DNA.
