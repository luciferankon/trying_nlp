The debut feature from A Chip & A Chair Films IF YOU COULD SAY IT IN WORDS is an indelible character-driven portrait of two very different but equally broken souls. Nelson is a painter with undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome struggling to complete a triptych on the theme of emotions he can only understand on an intellectual level. Sadie is a girl whose big-city dreams were dashed before she crawled home to Philadelphia where she treads water at a job that's not her career with a roommate who's not her friend and a bedmate who's not her lover. She is sleeping with her boss Mark... which would come as a surprise to his wife. For Sadie and Nelson a one-night stand turns into much more. For the first time Nelson is overcome by the emotions that he paints. With him Sadie is freed from the strains and pressures of day-to-day "real life." As the weeks go by they come to share their secrets freely but sharing feelings comes slower. Soon however the jealousies and suspicions of others plant doubts in Sadie's head about the future. As Nelson becomes more immersed in his triptych racing to capture on canvas what he cannot say in words Sadie is pushed to finally decide in what direction she will take her life. Unapologetically romantic savagely realistic IF YOU COULD SAY IT IN WORDS takes a long hard look at the price of integrity and the illogical ways of the heart.
