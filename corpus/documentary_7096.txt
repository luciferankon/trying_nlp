I was recently contacted by Northwestern's Law school to see if I would be interested in helping bring awareness to their Center on Wrongful Convictions. They are a wonderful group of attorneys and students who work tirelessly to help free innocent people that are serving someone else's time. With complete creative freedom I chose 6 Exonerees to both photograph and interview. The time I spent with each of these good people was incredibly moving and a powerful lesson in how our flawed system can so quickly imprison those without adequate defense and then immediately forget them once they are set free. I hope you enjoy my first time effort!
