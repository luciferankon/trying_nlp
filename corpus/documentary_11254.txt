Search for six of New Zealand's sexiest men loosely based on the format of the "Popstars" series which sparked pop bands TrueBliss Bardot Hear'Say and others. Of the 150 hopeful auditionees 12 were shortlisted and put through a rigorous training choreography and exercise regime to turn these 'boys into men' before choosing the final 6 that were to become "KiwiFire" New Zealand's answer to Australia's "Manpower".
