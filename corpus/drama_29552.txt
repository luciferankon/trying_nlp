This drama series centres around a team of television journalists working on a weekly current-affairs programme that screens on the privately-owned Pacific Television (PTV) channel. The main characters include Amanda Robbins (Katie Wolfe) who was lured back to Wellington from Australia by PTV Chief Executive Martin Woolf (Jonathan Hendry) who wanted her Rottweiller qualities to raise the controversial show's ratings. Robbins was appointed by Woolf without consulting Bernard Fry (John Sumner) the producer of Cover Story and Fry and the rest of the staff have struggled with Robbins' tabloid-esque style and her "blood on the road" approach.
