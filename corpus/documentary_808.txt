Sweet new babies are dying. Loving dedicated mothers are taking their own lives. Marriages of new parents are falling apart. Smart strong women are being beat down. Something in the culture of postpartum care is broken and we need to figure out why before more lives are affected. This independent documentary by Producer/Director Gillian Fritzsche is an irreverent but informative look at what new moms and dads need and why better postpartum care could make the whole world a better place!
