A hot summer evening in New York City: 3 people - a young drummer a young and an old lady - accidentally meet in the cellar of an apartment house where they want to wash their clothes. Suddenly the door of that cellar room closes and they find themselves trapped: the door can't be opened from inside. No gig for the drummer no flight to San Francisco and to her fianc√© for the young lady no romantic dinner for the old one. So they start talking trying to find out what kind of persons they are. I mean they start talking then pick on each other then provoke each other until the discussion resembles an inquisition. And then they change roles and the game starts again.
