A demobilized Red Army soldier returns to his village. Inspired by the spirit of collectivism he plows a field so that the kulak's portion now belongs to the community and sows it with grain confiscated from the 'philistines'. His father a man of traditional world outlook lives in a pantheistic world of the Ukrainian ethos where sin has a physical dimension. He does not believe that the stolen grain will sprout on the stolen land. When the grain finally sprouts the old man admits that his son was right; for the sake of building a new world the old laws of the universe should be broken.
