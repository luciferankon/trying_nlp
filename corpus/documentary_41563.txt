iThemba (ih-TEM-bah) is a character-driven documentary about hope and resistance in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The film follows the 30 member HIV+ Sinikithemba (sin-ih-kih-TEM-bah) Choir on their journey from South Africa to the United States to perform at an international AIDS conference. The choir's powerful blend of Traditional Zulu and Gospel music stirs the hearts of all who hear their music; their hope and persistent faith in the value of human life lifts the spirit. Interwoven with the choir's journey is the story of one of their lead vocalists Zinhle Thabethe (ZIN-kleh Tah-BEH-tay). An eloquent advocate for HIV+ people in her community Zinhle's life is proof that the fight against HIV/AIDS is not yet lost. Through a personal journey with Zinhle and the other choir members the film captures the struggles triumphs and dire need for action that characterizes the AIDS epidemic as it affects South Africa.
