The tale of a group of typical twenty-somethings living in London at the end of the 20th Century. An exploration of hard choices hard luck and hard living. A dip into the youth culture that is so prevalent in any major city today. A foray into drugs drink relationships growing up responsibility lessons to be learnt changing values and morals and the realization that no matter how far (or fast) you run the battles are the same wherever you are. "A Little Rain Must Fall" - sometimes life has a way of catching up with you.
