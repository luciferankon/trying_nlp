Vicki Wallace (Joan Blondell) takes great pleasure in teasing her husbandTony Wallace (Warren William) who takes no pleasure at all in being teased and it isn't long before he ups and clips her on the chin. Vicki's friend and attorney Vernon Thorpe (Edward Everett Horton) secures a divorce for her and Vicki and Vernon are soon married. Vicki's yen for wearing revealing clothes and a penchant for inviting ex-husband Tony to dinner soon provokes the easily-provoked Vernon into belting one on her himself. She goes to Tony's apartment where Tony is entertaining Bonnie (Joan Wheeler) who is not all that entertained by the presence of Vicki especially after Vicki shows every intent of moving in and staying. Vernon shows up with George (Frank McHugh) and Anita (Claire Dood) evidently along so F. Hugh Herbert's lines can be spread among five players instead of three and Vicki more or less tells Vernon that as long as she is going to be slugged by a husband she will just go back to Tony because he is a better slugger...or something. A pre-production code film and one of the reasons for the creation of same.
