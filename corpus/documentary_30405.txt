In Tweakers the real life crystal meth addictions are re-enacted. Stories include a lawyer turned bathhouse attendant a co-dependent mother and her addicted son and more. The re-enactments are mixed with interviews and information on the crystal meth epidemic. Based on the nonfiction book Tweakers: How Crystal Meth Is Raving Gay America (Alyson 2005) the documentary charts the precipitous decline of casual weekend users who quickly become regular abusers of the highly addictive drug which many psychopharmacologists believe is more destructive and more difficult to treat. In Tweakers Dr. Thomas F. Newton professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine describes the havoc wrought by the drug: "Once somebody gets into crystal they're just going to go down the toilet." .
