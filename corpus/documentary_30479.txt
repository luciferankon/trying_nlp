History tells of cultures that grew and flourished only to disappear or turn to dust. Some have left behind accounts of the catastrophes that destroyed them. The question is whether we will experience the same fate. Will the earth end up as a barren planet razed to the ground by nuclear weapons earthquakes or floods? Has it happened before? Will it all happen again as prophets have so often predicted? Or is there still hope for us all? Following some of the traces left behind by our ancestors exploring ancient Indian wisdom and consulting today's religious leaders scientists and philosophers - this documentary reveals a startling picture of mankind's very early existence and a glimpse into a future we all share.
