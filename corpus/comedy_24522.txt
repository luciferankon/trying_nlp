A talk show adding a hip urban vibe that is guaranteed to make you laugh. They tell it like it is! Nothing to hide - No fronts. Just a fresh opinion. They talk about it all! This show concept is like the View meets Sex in the City and a dash of In Living Color and okay...a little QUEER EYE for the Straight Girl!!! Can it get any better than that?
