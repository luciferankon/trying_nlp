A typical Ken Maynard western that makes no sense logically since Ken "Fiddlin'" McDermid is a government agent sent to infiltrate and put an end to the Wolf Morgan gang which he could have done in the first five minutes simply by informing the townspeopleall gathered to meet bigwig Kerriman and his daughter Ann at the train station that the gang was on their way to loot the town. Instead he and Banty distract the townspeople by playing three songs (Maynard fiddlin' and Rice on the harmonica) while Wolf and his gang are up the street looting the town. The postman who got his head caved in because Maynard didn't blow the whistle probably wasn't impressed with Maynard's method of operation. But if he had then he wouldn't have had to be rescued three different times by his horse Tarzan and that and long conversations with Tarzan were SOP with Maynard. That and long running scenes of the sheriff's posse and the outlaw gang all riding in various directions make up most of the film. Highlight is Glora Shea (dubbed?) singing "My Pretty Quadroon."
