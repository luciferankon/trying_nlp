The story is held together by a beach party attended by six relatively young women. Claiming that it may be the heat that is making her do it each woman tells of a sex fantasy that she is reminded of by the situation. Sex with an ex-husband a man in uniform and an automobile mechanic are stories that make up half the segments. The other three have to do with unique places where their fantasy trysts occur: in a public place after hours in a dance hall and finally in the mountains.
