Katie Morag is a feisty red-headed girl who lives with her family on the magical Scottish Island of Struay. She is one of life's great enthusiasts. Her determination and stubbornness (in Scotland she'd be described as 'thrawn') land her in considerable trouble at times but also help her find a way out of her difficulties. She can be stormy and tearful and she can be charming and helpful. She's energetic one of life's doers. As a sister she has her failings but like most sisters her good points outweigh the bad. Katie Morag has terrific generosity of spirit. There are times when it fades and others when it can be misdirected. But her family and neighbours on the whole adore her; and she on the whole adores them.
