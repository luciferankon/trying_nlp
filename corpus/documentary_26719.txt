An intimate portrait of a family imploding as they try to cope with the father's alcoholism and its toll on their lives is at the heart of this documentary. The father at the core of the piece is John Bellany recently named as Scotland's greatest ever artist. The man who has made the film is his youngest son Paul who in 2008 left his post as Visual Effects artist on the Harry Potter movies to embark on this very personal project - Bellany - Fire in the Blood. The hour long film is a very honest and moving but also ultimately uplifting picture of a family disintegrating experiencing their pain and emerging back together as told in the words of all the family members against a backdrop of their father's work a trove of personal pictures and songs specially written and recorded by the filmmaker.
