Groups of writers dance  theatre and cinema companies have transformed places Medina and markets of Tunis and Tunisia in a new stage usable by everyone in order to sensitize the civil society to art meant as civic duty. By following the work of groups as Zwewla Ghar-boys Break Art Studio Brotha from Another Motha Company Danseurs-Citoyens Art Solution and many others the documentary analyzes a new way of active citizenship in post-revolutionary Tunisia and the impact that this one could have in the current precarious context on Tunisian civil society and in particular on new generations by diffusing an alternative culture to most radical movements of the country.
