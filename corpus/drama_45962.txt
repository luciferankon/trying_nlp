The film tells the true story of French clown Miloud Oukili from his arrival in Romania in 1992 (three years after the fall of Ceausescu) to his encounter with the street children of Bucharest known as ÂŤboskettariÂť who live in the streets and sleep in Bucharest's sewers eking a living out of petty crime begging and prostitution. Miloud wants to meet these neglected kids turned into a quasi-feral state by their tragic past and ravaged by physical and sexual abuse and drug addiction and shine some light in their lives. Although his efforts are at first hampered by corrupt and prejudiced Romanian police officers Miloud will succeed in creating a real circus company with the ÂŤboskettariÂť. The street children will perform in Bucharestâs main square proving the world that they are not rejects but human beings.
