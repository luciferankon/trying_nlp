SKIN DEEP takes place during the 1960's in Englewood NJ - the first desegregated school district in the region. Fresh out of the Jim Crow era and still reeling from witnessing his father's murder by white supremacists Jacob Lunon is determined to live a meaningful life undeterred by the institutions and people that plagued him as a younger boy. Although Jacob has black skin his friends and his "siblings" the Kaplan children are all Jewish and Jacob would sooner be seen at synagogue than with a group of his kids who "look" more alike. SKIN DEEP is the transformation from being judged and limited to a color to becoming your own individual person regardless of skin tone.
