Aboard a cruise ship sailing to the Bahamas Kevin 17 decides to watch the ship's departure from the large observatory. While looking at the Manhattan skyline a man in his early 40's wearing a leather jacket and a Mohawk catches Kevin's attention. The man is filming the buildings passing by and his friend is talking to him so neither notices the somewhat shy Kevin enamored by the cute guy. After a seemingly long dinner with his brother his mom and his step-dad Kevin is finally free to wander on his own. He initially pretends to go with a group of teenagers but is determined to find the guy. The image of his Mohawk and leather jacket makes Kevin shiver with anticipation and he's willing to search the whole ship to find him. After many hours when he's almost ready to give up Kevin spots the man and without hesitation walks up to him. The guy looks at him and smiles but the music is so loud it is challenging to talk. Regardless Kevin wants to meet this man but the only conversation starter he can think of is to ask if his septum piercing hurt when he had it done. The man smiles and laughs while shaking his head no. Kevin sits down next to the guy to listen to the live band playing 80's rock 'n' roll songs. The man can see that Kevin is flirting even though neither one is talking. After an agonizing moment Kevin again tries to start a conversation by saying that he eventually would like to have the same piercing. The man smiles and asks if Kevin is even legal. When Kevin confidently explains that most states allow sex after 16 the man laughs and whispers his name in Kevin's ear. "I'm Andr√©."
