We stare at mirrors as if 'image' was a weapon of self-defense. At night I hide in actors' dressing rooms for a working class experience. By day I face an old theatre being razed to the ground making way for a parking lot. Graffitis have curtains the nose cap of an umbrella arises from a mount of sand. Oh Happy Days! No need to stage anything! The bulldozer is a dinosaur whose teeth and gracious neck swings by a EU flag. In the boxes we await the audience. Sometimes nobody comes. Lost in a symbolic show of reality I can only watch the world's end because all the endangered species perform and a reflecting labyrinth of life stories breaks through the glass of the Economic Eating Machine. Even when the sky is falling theatre will always happen. So choose the right place.
