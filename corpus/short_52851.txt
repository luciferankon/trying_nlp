The Kimchi Warrior is a unique blend of martial arts comedy and the promotion of good health. Based on the premise of Popeye our hero obtains supernatural strength by consuming the most prominent Korean dish to defend mankind from the world's most notorious diseases (i.e. The Swine Flu Mad Cow Disease Malaria SARS etc.) Each episode a new "disease character" is summoned by Evil Lord of Disease to wipe out mankind. Under the tutelage of the clairvoyant Kimchi Master The Kimchi Warrior is sent to fight and ultimately annihilate the disease with a different "ingredient weapon". It's very entertaining and educational for kids. It is also advocates good nutrition to everyone since Kimchi is deemed one of the healthiest foods in the world.
