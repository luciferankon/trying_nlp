Tim is having a birthday party in a big basement he leased for the day. Almost everybody he knows is there; his buddy Freddo a weed smoking wise ass. Kiana who's only focus is on getting an old boyfriend laid and Michael. He goes straight over the top by using too much alcohol and illegal drugs. A party with events everybody of us should recognize. Shot in just a few days by four different directors "minus zwei" shows us four individual memories of four attending party-guests.
