After the Buddha passed away and his body had been cremated the relics of his body were collected and venerated in the highest esteem. Since that time the veneration of these relics and the relics of the Buddhist saints that have followed in the footsteps of the Buddha has formed a core element in the practice and dissemination of Buddhism throughout its thousands of year old history in Asia and the world at large. Shot on location at important Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India Nepal Sri Lanka Myanmar Thailand Laos and Cambodia and featuring interviews with prominent Buddhist teachers and scholars this project documents the beautiful fascinating and profoundly mysterious world of the Blazing Buddha Relics The Blazing Buddha Relics also features expert narration from Emmy award winner Peter Coyote and a hypnotic original soundtrack by Bay Area Jazz legend Brian Melvin.
