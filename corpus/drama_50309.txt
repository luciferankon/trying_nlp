While walking he hears a woman's cries issuing from a house and enters to investigate. In her delirium the dying woman mistakes Jim for Tom her nephew and entrusts him to deliver a package to her daughter Rose ( Jean Taylor ). Later the scheming nephew finds Jim's forgotten hat and follows him West. Jim goes to the saloon where Rose was last seen but before he can find her Tom has him arrested. On the way to the jail the coach crashes in a storm and Jim escapes. Finally locating Rose Jim hands over the package which contains papers that identify the governor as her father. To complete his task Jim takes Rose to her father and then quietly departs only to be shanghaied by Chinese smugglers. After he foils the smugglers Jim passes a final test of character devised by the governor and is rewarded with Rose's hand in marriage.
