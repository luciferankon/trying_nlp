Based on historical fact Tea sketches the tale of Seikyo a prince-cum-monk. By suffering "bitter love" Seikyo transcended a cruel destiny to achieve an austere peace the meaning of which he teaches through tea rituals. But that is only half the story. For Seikyo's bitter love also involves a princess an erotic passion so tainted by jealousy that it ends in death shamanistic rituals and fierce struggles over an ancient book of wisdom. Combining the lyricism of Italianate opera lush Western orchestration a male "Greek chorus" gamelan-like percussion and the organic sounds of nature - water paper and stones - Tea brings an ancient tale to the 21st century.
