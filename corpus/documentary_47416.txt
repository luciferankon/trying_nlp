This happening by Oscar Masotta took place for the first time in the Institute Di Tella fifty years ago. It was one of the politically more controversial actions of the sixties confronting the audience of the Di Tella with a group of actors pretending to be Lumpenproletariat standing on a podium subjected to intense light and a penetrating sound. Dora Garc√≠a has repeated the same happening in 2016 and filmed it.
