Four terrorists of different ethnicities and without an obvious common link take hold of an American jetliner and demand release of their leader from a British prison. They murder a stewardess to prove they mean business and threaten to pick off more if their demands are not met. But surprises await the hijackers: an armed policeman is aboard and the passengers manage to begin a whispered plot to fight back. After a bloody shootout with further casualties on both sides the mood of the film shifts sharply as the plot devolves to a single question: do the passengers wait till the plane lanes and turn the surviving terrorists over to the authorities or do they "try" them themselves aboard the plane? A U.S. domestic flight is hijacked by psychopathic terrorists who are demanding the release of their leader from a U.K. prison. One at a time these low-lifes begin ruthlessly & cold-bloodedly murdering passengers & crew members when their demands are not met. But what no one - including the terrorists - knows is that an armed police officer is on board and he and the other passengers stealthily plot to overpower their tormentors. After a female flight attendant is viciously murdered by the ringleader they strike. The police officer guns down a terrorist standing in an aisle while two flight attendants throw scalding hot coffee in the face of the terrorist leader. A third terrorist is overpowered by other passengers when he tries to come to his friends' aid and the fourth in the cockpit is knocked unconscious by the police officer & flight crew. Now the psychopaths are bound & at the mercy of the people they had abused & tortured for hours and the passengers themselves are considering what to do...whether to hand over the terrorists for trial to the U.S. court system or eliminate these demented murderous people?
