A Belly full of Dreams is about Ramu a boy of 9 had a simple dream of going to school. As with everything in his life he invested the dream in the belly of the puppet Narrator Know-it-all. Know-it-all knowing it all realized that the dream would lie wasted if he didn't talk about it and so began the fable of Ramu - a rag picker who carries the burden of supporting a lazy father a sickly mother and a life not facilitating his immediate fundamental right - EDUCATION! As the narrative alternates between the puppet world and the real world we follow Ramu in his travails exploring both his physical and emotional journeys as he confronts a corrupt system that is threatening to destroy the Nation. Bruised and battered he struggled but never gave up-his will so strong that it broke the universe from its slumber. The universe conspired to help and sends forth a tooth fairy; to unleash her magic to set right a broken System and to revive the sagging Belly of the puppet Know-it-all. A magic so beautiful that it made true the little boy's dream.
