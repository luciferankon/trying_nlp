The poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko himself once an immigrant in New York wrote that NYC is not a city not a country but all humanity in one drop. THE CITY explores this humanity now in New York City through the unique eyes of non-native New Yorkers exiles immigrants refugees eccentrics and a Ghost. A collage of stories together with the montage of images sound and music running through the film like a heartbeat create New York moments frozen in a particular time. Accompanied by haunting visuals Rainer Maria Rilke's poetry and a unique score by Sxip Shirey's "mutant harmonica" THE CITY is also a visual poem to a city of immigrants which keeps re-inventing itself through its history and into the new century.
