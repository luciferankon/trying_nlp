GAUCHO is an evocation of a dying way of life and a portrait of a true original Heraldo Rial an eighty-year-old cattle rancher who embodies the traditional ranching culture of his Patagonian ancestors. 'Gauchos' are proud self-reliant cowboys living on the edge of the known world in an immense land virtually untouched by man. Grazing their herds in glacial valleys under mountain peaks and along trout-filled rivers and lakes it is a way of life virtually unchanged in centuries: hard beautiful and dangerous.
