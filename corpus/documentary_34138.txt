At 27 having never left NYC the world Anthony DeJesus knew was limited to a 10 block radius in the Bronx. At age 27 in the middle of the night Anthony climbed into a camper van with two relative strangers from Colorado and their dog and embarked on a 7 week journey across the Western United States. The stated goal: adventure broaden horizon learn and grow. It was a Journey that changed him forever. Over the next 7 weeks Anthony Jesse Spiegel Vitek Linhart and Gordo (their dog ) visited 7 states climbed mountains practiced yoga and formed an unbreakable friendship as they faced and overcame challenges along the way. The journey was full of love and fraught with conflict as Anthony worked to reconcile his past experiences ideas and beliefs with this new set of experiences and the ideas and feelings that accompanied them. Anthony undergoes an unmistakable transformation unlocking and discovering things within himself that he never knew existed. When he exits the van back in NYC Anthony is a new man. He was anxious to be returning but also more ready than ever to take control of his life and redefine the path that had previously seemed inevitable.
