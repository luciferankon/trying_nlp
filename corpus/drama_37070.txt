Nobody pays attention to eccentric librarian Peggy Cort and that's fine with her...until she meets James Sweatt - the "over tall" boy who absolutely everybody notices. The two are odd candidates for friendship but once their lonely paths cross in a small Cape Cod town they find themselves a perfect match in ways neither could have imagined. As James grows to seven feet then past eight - so does Peggy's heart and their unique unforgettable romance.
