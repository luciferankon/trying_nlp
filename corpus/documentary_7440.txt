The documentary film Redemption Song sings the song of redemption that the African refugee Cissoko dreams for his people and his land. Having arrived in Italy in the hottest time of migration Cissoko decides to return home to convince his young brothers to not emigrate in search of false dreams. Once in Africa he begins to make projections in schools and villages to inform its people about the precarious living conditions of many immigrants often dramatically close to slavery. 'Virtually' accompanied on his trip by a few artists and by the memory of Thomas Sankara Cissoko reiterates over and over to his brothers his invitation to put an end to internal conflicts to unite and to emancipate Africa working for its progress while not abandoning it to Western chimera. Eventually our protagonist's quest will take him to Brazil to pay homage to the descendants of slaves who thanks to the unity they have achieved have kept their African origins alive. At the core of the documentary lies the awareness that what is first and foremost necessary is an internal emancipation capable of inciting each individual to fight for their own true essence. Therefore it is also the evocation of slavery that Redemption Song deals with making itself spokesman of the black universe which still today is certainly the greatest victim of this injustice.
