Deep night. Into a motel's room of the Copenhagen suburb Christian a 19-year-old man has just finished to have sex with Lulu an older prostitute of 38 years old. When the woman is ready to leave the young man holds her and asks her to stay one more hour just to talk with him. At the beginning she refuses but later on she agrees to stay longer. From that moment the two characters start talking and as the dialogue proceeds their demons and their regrets come out. They are both bound to a desperate story of abandon: the woman is running away from her past of violence but moreover from the terrible regret for the abandon of her son when he was only four. The young man is desperately searching his mother who abandoned him 15 years ago.
