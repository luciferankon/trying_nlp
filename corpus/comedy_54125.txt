SAVE ME drops us into random lives mid-sentence. We get to know people through storylines that unravel with humour and pathos and a built-in ticking time bomb - that one of them at some point will be blindsided by a medical emergency. And all of it is rooted in the on-going stories of our regular cast of EMTs who come to the rescue.
