When a young girl becomes lost in the hustle and bustle of Tehran her journey turns into a dazzling exercise on the nature of film itself. In this ingenious and daringly original feature world renowned director Jafar Panahi (The White Balloon Crimson gold) has wrapped a blunt political critique inside the layers of a deceptively simple film. A girl in traditional female clothing with her arm in plaster comes out of school one day and doesn't find her mother meeting her. She decides to travel home herself though she doesn't know her address and remembers the road only visually. The film begins as a little girl accidentally left at school at the end of the day is forced to find her own way home despite not knowing her address. Then abruptly it becomes a documentary -- as the child actress decides that like the character she was playing she needs to go home immediately. The set is plunged into chaos as the filmmakers and actors struggle to navigate the city streets of modern Iran.
