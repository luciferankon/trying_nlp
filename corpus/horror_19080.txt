Islamic Extremists begin a religious cleansing of an English city renaming the city 'Bradistan' and declaring it a Sharia controlled zone. Four terrified kuffar (non-Muslim) women are violently captured by the Islamic Extremists and are imprisoned in small cages and await their punishment. A young mujahideen (one engaged in Jihad) eagerly accepts the opportunity to quickly rise through the ranks of his terrorist organization by executing the kuffar (non-muslim) women on camera and live via internet/social media.
