1946. The Indonesian Republic has declared Independence but Holland refuses to acknowledge the newly independent state. Most of the Japanese have just pulled out; the British are charged with restoring order and the Dutch are slowly sending soldiers back in. In this charged environment The Emerald Butterfly delivers a noir crime story from three different points of view. First is the Dutchman trying to take back what he thinks is his. Second is an Indonesian woman searching for a new life. Third is the American consul general caught up in conspiracy. The three stories will intertwine.
