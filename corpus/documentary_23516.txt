This 45 minute documentary by Mark Hejnar is a sort of Whitman's Sampler of sickness chronicling such wildly diverse and extreme personalities as G.G. Allin Mike Diana Full Force Frank GLOD Annie Sprinkle and others. This collection of short clips and vile moments is certainly NOT for the squeamish as these are the artists and performers who have taken the term "free expression" to it's limits--and beyond.
