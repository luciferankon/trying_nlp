When Ryan and Pete find out their roommate Tucker is dying of liver failure they're devastated...devastated that he still owes them rent and that they'll have to clean up all the rubbish left in his bed when he finally croaks. Well their worries are short lived as their prayers are answered by a stranger at their front door with an interesting proposition; Ryan's everlasting soul for a new liver for Tucker. Naturally the guys find the deal to be more than reasonable and our stage is set; Tucker has his new lease on life Ryan has his first task in taking out the devil's hot daughter and the devil has some new drinking buddies...whether they like it or not.
