Gene Kramer is a high school senior who can't wait to graduate and get out of Branson Missouri. Gene has stuck it out four years in the JROTC with his best friend and school lothario Peter just to earn a college scholarship and a ticket out of town. However the trouble making twosome is in for a crisp reality check when they realize they haven't completed their 200-hour community service requirement. In order to graduate they must finish their remaining 198 hours in the 4 weeks before graduation. In addition to class and JROTC Gene and Peter must spend every waking minute of their time at the local nursing home crisis call center highway clean-up (with a bus-load of convicts.) They deal with drug addicts deranged seniors and the quirky community of Branson all while overcoming their meddlesome and vindictive cougar drill Sergeant MacNamara. When Gene meets a girl at the nursing home it strains not only his commitment to his and Peter's community service goal but also their bro-mance. The clock is ticking as graduation approaches and the boys better clean up their act (and their town) if they ever want to see their way out of Branson High.
