GIFT is a creative documentary inspired by Lewis Hyde's classic bestseller The Gift: "a brilliant defense of the value of creativity and its importance in a culture increasingly governed by money and overrun with commodities." RIchly cinematic and politically provocative it follows character-driven stories: from the elaborate preparations for a Pacific Northwest potlatch to an unexpected gift of music at the Auckland Art Gallery from an occupied factory in Rome protected by art to the "pirate utopia" of Burning Man.
