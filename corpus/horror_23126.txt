In July of 2017 an anonymous phone call was made to the West Virginia Police Department (WVPD). The call was later discovered to have been made by Julian Jordan of Dallas Texas' Circle Ten Council BSA Troop 861 the day of the disappearance of several members and himself. Seven days later their footage was found.
