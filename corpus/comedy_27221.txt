In 2008 'Sketch' was a powerhouse of mediocre jokes and word puns. Led by Jeffrey Patrick the group stayed true to good natured comedy but group member Andrew Phung quickly stole the limelight and brought forth the catch phrase 'Rice Gotta Cook'. Two years later 'Sketch' is no more than a long lost memory except to Jeffrey Patrick. Fueled by his desire to make people laugh he attempts to get the group back together for one last shot at fame. Will they stay true to their beliefs or will Andrew Phung convert them into 'Ethnic Comedians'? This comedic feature film was shot with an independent budget of less than $1000 and an improvised script.
