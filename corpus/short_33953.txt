On the occasion of a film festival the film maker travels with her digital-video cam through the USA and is searching tor the American dream. Whoever happens to come into her lens-view is asked and apparently the topic is quite sacred to some Americans. But not to the film-maker since it becomes more and more obvious that her own American dream consists primarily of one desire: finally to have sex in America. Soon if possible and good. But is it all about love? Or is it about America? Each character follows his own dream in this experimental road-movie and one of them even comes true in the end.
