This takes us to something called the "Guys Choice Awards" from Spike TV. Mel Gibson presents the citation of Club as a Guys Classic; Fincher Norton and Pitt accept the award. In addition to shots of those guys as they accept we see the three as they prepare to go onstage. It's self-congratulatory but still somewhat entertaining.
