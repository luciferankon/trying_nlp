The story of a woman who loved three men for their different ways and discovered after many a heartache that her first love was also her true love. Edward the Peacemaker was on the throne of England when Joanna Godden's father died and bequeathed a large farm on the Romney Marsh of Kent. Beautiful impetuous self-willed Joanna determined to defy convention and - a mere woman - run the farm herself. Her decision outraged the whole shire - not least her farmer neighbour Arthur Alce.
