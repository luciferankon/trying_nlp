A documentary about the film _Peeping Tom (1960)_ (qv). How and why it was made how the uniformly bad reaction from the critics at the time affected everybody concerned and how it is regarded now. Interviews with the cast and writer and with film critics past and present. Older critics still try to justify their bad reviews some referring to it as a "snuff movie" despite the fact that the only death we see is that of the killer. It was released just as writer 'Leo Marks' was about to publish his autobiography of his time in SOE so there is quite a bit about wartime influences on the study of fear.
