Based on a true story 'Champion' centers around Anthony Campione and his life growing up in an Italian family in an Italian neighborhood west of Chicago where his darker skin was always explained away. In his early thirties after years of personal struggle and living as a "dark-Italian" Anthony unearths the truth about where he comes from. Anthony states "I woke up 'white' and went to bed 'black'." A phrase that Anthony can only find humor in after he has confronted racism including his own traveled the South to find his biological father and made peace with himself and his family. A compelling story about courage the persistence to find truth and unconditional love. Heard on NPR's "This American Life" with Ira Glass.
