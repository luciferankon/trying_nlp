After the war infinite numbers of refugees leave in search of a new home. They now stand in the hall of a large mansion waiting to receive their deeds of ownership for sections of land that the lord of the manor had left behind after he fled. Among them is the young Jeruscheit who during her travels had to bury one of her own children. Her husband has been declared missing and up until now she has had little purpose in life. But then she discovers it: to work to build and to help others. And maybe someday Jeruscheit will find her family.
