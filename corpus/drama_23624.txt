There are essentially two types of people: those who think with their stomachs and those who think with their hearts. Conflict between them is inevitable says the writer Nikolai Haitov. The central character in Cherry Orchard - Dinyo a secretary of the local communist party organization and Sava the assistant manager of the local cooperative farm - also fall into these two categories. Sava often takes the law into his own hands a little though not for his own benefit but in the interest of the peasants. Dinyo on the other hand is gruff and unsociable but scrupulously honest. He is not prepared to cover up for the assistant manager who is good at troubleshooting but whose schemes often leave the secretary holding the baby. Dinyo is demoted and resumes his job as a shepherd but persist in his fight for the truth. The cherry orchard he is tending as a symbol of his faith in the future. Dinyo's totally unwarranted accidental death brings the village drama to its catharsis which shows him to be victor in the struggle against moral compromise and timeserving.
