it's getting warmer in the mountain town of Aurora Village and the snow is melting. The Ham-Hams that live there think that Bijou is their Snow White Princess who can pray for the snow to come back so they send a snow fairy hamster named Crystal to go get her. A pirate hamster on a flying ship captures her along the way so Hamtaro and the Ham-Hams have to save her and maybe even save the village.
