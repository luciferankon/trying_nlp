Two friends are spending a week day/night crossing London inside a black cab and reading a science fiction book. In the story their imagination is so powerful that they are able to become the characters from the book and re-create new and better realities around them in 3D and in blue. This is the story of X - a little germ entering someone's mouth. X's vision is somewhat blurred. Its vision is in 'distorted 3D'. The mouth is the ultimate frontier between the inside of a creature and the rest of the universe. It is the border control. There is a long process before reaching the heart of the body. X aims to re-produce itself into the heart of the body just like a little mouse. When inside the body X the germ can see feel and breathe exactly what the creature's body sees feels and breathes. A mouse penetrates inside a man through the mouth and becomes a germ a virus infecting the whole human body; this is zone B. In zone A it's how a man feels on the outside how he sees and feels whilst the germ is multiplying and affecting his brain. The story is narrated in the future by two friends during a trip inside a black cab across London. The presentation is in real 3d (glasses are needed or not).
