Based on the award winning series of graphic novels by Ashely Wood and TP Louise Popbot tells the story of a misfit group of punk rockers that find themselves in the rather surprising position of having to save humanity from a legion of homicidal robots. This unlikely quest takes our anarchists to the far reaches of the galaxy and to the very edge of sanity as they discover that's there's more to saving the planet than releasing a few "protest" tracks.
