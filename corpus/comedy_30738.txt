The actors in theatre don't like much the top scene in Othello. They decide together with the prompter to make their own work. The plot of the drama should start joyfully - with a wedding. So the actors start to look for a bride and a groom. They choose the butcher Sárka ('Ladislava Kozderková' (qv)) who loves music and the shy clockmaker Ctirad ('Ludek Sobota' (qv). They fall in love with each other at first sight.
