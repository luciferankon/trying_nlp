Bolin Creek Unpaved explores the diversity and beauty of Carrboro's last intact riparian forest and the controversy surrounding its conservation. It's a story about our town but it's also a story about every town facing the issue of development versus conservation...the importance of having wild places next to where we live and how that adds to our quality of life more than "more pavement" ever can.
