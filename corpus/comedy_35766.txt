22- year old Cami asks her 40-something uncle Oliver to follow her and her three best friends to a party so he can film everything with his camcorder. The main reason behind this is that college rock band \'The Heroes\' will play that night and most importantly the band\'s lead singer Fernando will be there. Cami has a big crush on Fernando and has come up with a plan to hook up with him. Despite things not turning out as expected she will still learn important life lessons out of her big night out.
