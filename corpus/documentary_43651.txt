American photographer Charles Gatewood started out in the 1960s as a young man with dreams of showing the world the radical cultural developments that were going on in his country. He met many of the iconic instigators of change and documented them for posterity. As the decades passed Gatewood drifted more and more into a personal expression of sexual subcultures both in America and abroad. His powerful photos of pioneers within the tattooing- and piercing scenes helped pave the way for the movement that was to be called "Modern Primitives". It's a classic example of when art and in this example specifically photography merges with its general environment and takes on new forms that are impossible to stop. Or as the San Francisco based photographer himself describes it: "Once the toothpaste is out of the tube you can't put it back".
