As indicated by the title this is an obvious melodrama where a beautiful rich girl (Miranda) departs from family norms and traditions by falling in love with a poor singer - obliging her to leave home. The singer also deserts her but the heroine can no longer return home. With the help of the "emancipated" Florance she is driven to prostitution where she will experience countless humiliations but at the same time her soul remains untouched and absolutely pure.
