The Ozeander family has been farming and redneckin' in Idaho before it was a state. Their wicked neighbor and rival August is using corruption to push the Ozeanders out. The Feds inform Troy the older brother who peaked in high school and Jerry the younger brother too liberal for his own good that they have to pay millions or they will lose the farm. Grandpa Buster the renegade and crazy patriarch and Grandma the raunchy matriarch are estranged and the boys realize reconciliation within the family and saving the farm will take serious WD- 40. Darren the middle closeted gay brother manages the local radio station and before he knows it the boys have kick-started an anti-government controversy that would make Duck Dynasty blush. Troy threatens federal judges live on air with a "second amendment style" solution prompting national attention. Darren calls on a favor from an old friend Isabelle a TV reporter to interview them. She still feels scorned from when Darren jilted her in college and hurries to investigate and possibly reconcile. August sees his chance slipping away and tells the agents to arrest them. Isabelle flies from Los Angeles to Idaho to interview the boys for national television but her exclusive is interrupted when the agents burst onto the scene! The family farm owes millions in taxes and their rival August is eager to seize it. They use the family's failing radio show to attract viewers. Jerry then argues with Troy who threatens federal judges on air. When the rant goes viral the brothers become more famous than Idaho's potatoes.
