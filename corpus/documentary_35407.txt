The audience will go on a whirlwind journey from the tropical forests of Indonesia to the boardrooms of American and European corporations. The film will give a voice to both the people whose survival depends on the palm oil industry and those who are struggling to survive despite it; those who risk their lives each day to keep the bulldozers out of the rainforest and those who justify that cost.
