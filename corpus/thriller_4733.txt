Suzanne and her stepdaughter Molly move into a new house hoping to start afresh after Molly's mum passed away. When the seven-year-old makes an 'imaginary friend' named Candace Suzanne assumes it's just her way of coping with everything that's happened. But as Molly's behaviour becomes ever more erratic Suzanne begins to suspect that her stepdaughter's new playmate might not be so imaginary after all.
