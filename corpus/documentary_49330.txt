In a decadent Rome where the neurosis of modern times finds expression in cynical and vulgar humor Mauro Bonanni contemplates old age with deep existential anxiety.

In fact Mauro is so fascinated by those faraway lands that he abruptly leaves for Cotonou in Benin where years before he had gone on a trip with a Beninese employee.
