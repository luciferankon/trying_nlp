Every twenty minutes an elephant is killed to feed an insatiable demand for ivory. African elephants may be gone in as little as ten years. Behind the slaughter are the most dangerous groups in the world; organized crime syndicates insurgents and terrorists. Ivory buys guns and ammunition for Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army and Sudan's Janjaweed both linked to mass atrocities and supports al-Shabaab the al Qaeda affiliate behind the attacks on Kenya's Westgate Mall and Garissa University. Making the biggest money on Illicit ivory trade are organized criminal syndicates that traffic humans narcotics and guns. The killing of Africa's elephants is not only a conservation issue - it is a matter of global security.
