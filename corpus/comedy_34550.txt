In the small town of Gangrene Gulch Alaska the new Park Ranger Zach arrives at his post just in time to investigate a string of suspicious deaths. He teams up with Mike the veteran ranger and Sam the beautiful and determined young coroner's assistant to solve the murders. The hilarious residents of the rural Alaskan town must turn to the rangers to save them from the half-man half-moose moosataur.
