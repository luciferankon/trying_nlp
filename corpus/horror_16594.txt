A psychological horror exploring the dark side of humanity. Nine gangsters in a twisted hell are forced by their demonic leader Zero to remember the pasts that led to this moment. Told from ten different point of views the film gradually unfolds into a nightmarish and horrifying conclusion. Nine gangsters with no past and no names. One leader. Zero. He knows everything about every one of them. Who are they? How did they get here? Tapping directly into their minds with vampire dexterity Zero gradually extracts the memories of their individual pasts. They all have a secret to tell and they are all responsible for what can only be described as the 'ultimate bank heist gone wrong.' Told in a non-linear fashion the film constantly flips from color to black and white and we gradually come closer to a nightmarish conclusion as unexpected as it is horrifying. Who is Zero?
