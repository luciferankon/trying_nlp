Harry's married to Marian and things are not going all that well so he wants out but somehow feels that a divorce is not the answer. After developing a winning blackjack system he hatches a plan that takes years of preparation: to fake his death assume a new identity and win $500000 at blackjack. When his wife notices his peculiar behavior she is urged by her parents to hire a private investigator to find out what he is doing. In an unusual twist of events Harry discovers the private investigator and not only hires him to keep tabs on his wife (whom he suspects is having an affair) but they become confidants. Harry carries out his fake suicide successfully and heads for Reno to complete the rest of his plan but he doesn't count on meeting lovely Amy and falling in love. To further complicate matters Amy is planning to leave for Israel and Harry decides to go with her but en route the plane is hijacked and Harry must find a way to conceal both his $500000 blackjack winnings and his true identity.
