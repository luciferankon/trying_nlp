American actor James Marsters who earned international fame in his role of the punk vampire "Spike" on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and its spin-off "Angel" showcases his talents on this made-for-DVD album. The "Words" half (45 min.) depicts Marsters's stage talents - he acted on stage and created a theater company for many years before appearing on television - as he explains the background of William Shakespeare's "Macbeth" and plays the part of Macbeth in the most important scenes and monologues. In the "Music" half of the DVD (58 min.) he performs (on acoustic and electric guitar) many of the songs that he played with his band Ghost of the Machine and throws in some new ones. These include "Birth of the Blues" "Smile" "Louise" and others that his fans enjoy. The major fault of the DVD is that it includes no credits and no explanation of where he was performing. It is chiefly a one-man show Marsters onstage with a microphone guitar and bottle of water but the actress who performs the role of Lady Macbeth should have been identified. The DVD has bottomed-out production values as Marsters produced the whole thing by himself.
