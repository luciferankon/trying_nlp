Rob Williams was an African-American living in Monroe North Carolina in the 1950s and 1960s. Living with injustice and oppression many African-Americans advocated a non-violent resistance. Williams took a different tack urging the oppressed to take up arms. Williams was stripped of his rank as leader of the local NAACP chapter but he continued to encourage local African-Americans to carry weapons as a means of self-defense. Wanted on a kidnapping charge Williams and his wife fled to Cuba. His radio show Radio Free Dixie could be heard in some parts of the United States.
