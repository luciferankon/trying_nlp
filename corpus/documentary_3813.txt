Over a hundred years ago the fortunate encounter of a French pilot Louis Chevrolet and an American investor William Durant marked the beginning of one of the most audacious automotive companies in the world. Devoted to the manufacture of high-performance and yet affordable cars with innovative design Chevrolet has since become a central reference not only for the motor sport and the automotive industry but for the lives of millions of people through generations and for Mexicans since 1936 when Chevrolet established its first factory in the country. Nowadays the company's leadership in the automotive world industry has been an important factor for economic development in our country.
