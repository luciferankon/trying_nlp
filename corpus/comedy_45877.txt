Back in the girl-power heyday of the 90s a hit single would easily get you 15 minutes of fame. But today you'd be lucky to get 15 seconds. Maxine played by People Just Do Nothing's Lily Brazier never made it big with her teenage girl group Variety and now as a middle-aged failing music manager she finds herself in crisis as the one act she looked after decides to drop her. But Maxine has a plan a come back. This time bigger bolder and well - older. Who cares about a hip young girl group anyway?. What the world really needs is the first ever band of mums. And with Maxine at the helm how can Mum Pop possibly fail? WANNABE is the story of unfinished business one last shot at fame and struggling to let go of a dream.
