Set in an imaginary Central European town under Turkish control about 300 years ago this film tells the story of two friends - fisherman Richardus (Stefan Kvietik) and executioner Emil (Vlado Muller). They are proud defiant men with Janosik blood flowing through their veins. Their inherent rebelliousness manifesting itself daily in these times of Turkish subjugation brings the two allies even closer together.
