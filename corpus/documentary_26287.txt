Ends of the Earth is the story of Catholic Missions in Canada through the eyes of a group of high schools students who travel to the Yukon on a mission trip. It's hard for them to overlook the majesty of God's creation. Will the long days and the week's work teach the students the value of pilgrimage of sacrifice and what it really means to be a missionary? Through this new original documentary Salt + Light invites viewers to become missionaries and bring the Good News to the ends of the earth.
