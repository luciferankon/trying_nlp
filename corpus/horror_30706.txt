Things get under way with "The Haunted House" a dark tale of a murderous suitor with a penchant for killing pretty young girls. The second story details the frightening events that unfold when a young innocent named Sarah ventures into the bone yard to recover a walking stick. Caught under the spell of a creature too horrible for words she is helpless to resist its diabolical charms. The third story entitled "Little Billy's Bones" finds the son of a woodcutter falling prey to his murderous new stepmother and things wind to a close in "White Wolf" in which a small town butcher makes a mint ridding the streets of wild wolves. When he reaches 500 kills and retires with money to spare he finds himself faced with the prospect of hunting one last wolf.
