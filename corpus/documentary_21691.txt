The story of Monica Kristensen who followed in the footsteps of Roald Amundsen the first man to reach the South Pole (1911). Her voyage was a dangerous one involving mid-ocean refueling of the expeditions aircraft on an iceberg. Packed ice closed around the group's ship and caused delays. On reaching their set off point they traveled 1800 miles by sledge over the Ross Ice Shelf before facing the Heiberg glacier - Antartica itself. However although the route to the South Pole lay beyond the wild winter weather was approaching. Monica and her team had to decide to risk going forward or turn back wasting years of planning.
