The film is a romantic comedy inspired by the fairytale word of Hoffmann's phantasms. A small antiquarian bookshop has survived as if by miracle amidst the center of an enormous modern city squeezed between glass and concrete. The keeper and a few visitors (true friends) are very much like Hoffmann's characters. The action alternately takes place both now and in the past diving into the parallel worlds of the reality and the magic.
