You are a boy named Charley Chuck who is at a carnival food-fight contest. You start off on the right side of the screen and must make your way to the left side where an ice-cream cone is dripping away waiting for you to eat it. To get there you must avoid falling into open manholes or being touched or pelted by four chefs (Jacques Oscar Angelo and Zorba) who are out to get you. You can pick up different kinds of food that are lying around the screen and throw it at them to get them out of the way but they can get you the same way. If the ice-cream cone melts before you get to it you lose that round. You get points for any food left on the screen when you eat the ice-cream cone. The speed of the music and the characters intensifies with each higher level of play. For a really good round you get an instant replay.
