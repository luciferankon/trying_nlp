Just Another Day is an offbeat office series following the lives of the employees of an ordinary office based company. One such employee Sam (Mike Potito) goes day to day with his "devil may care" attitude and general seeming lack of work ethic counterbalanced by his good friend and co-worker John (Robert Kersey) whose nose to the grindstone attitude and professional nature makes these two an unlikely pairing. Due to his attitude Sam gives some trouble to the ladies of the office Annie (Maria Natapov) and most especially Amy (Miranda Evans). Although the person who most seems to suffer the brunt of Sam's outrageous lack of a professional bone in his body is the department's boss Mr. Tyler (Steve Elliman) constantly having to put up with Sam's behavior.
