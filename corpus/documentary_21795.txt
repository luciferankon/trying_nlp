On July of 2012 the Drive Ford team was finally able to release the one hour film and documentary of this amazing trip. The film was completed by 'A Shore Thing TV' Production Company and directed by Chris Herd and Produced by Deborah Kuleff. Telecast on Australia Network and Qantas In-flight Entertainment the production team produced a wonderfully balanced film that brings together the trials and successes of the 2009 team and reflects them against the ups and downs of the original 1919 team. Tensions and humour blend beautifully with the story and history of the original expedition. There are diary entries from both Hudson Fysh and Paul McGinness which give the viewer more insight into what the trek must have been like 90 years ago. With interviews of the daughters of both men and historic still photos and footage from the era interspersed through the film 'Living the Dream of Wheels to Wings' is both educational and entertaining.
