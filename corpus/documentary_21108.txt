Ten years after participating in the very first Dutch Idols the ten former finalists of this immense popular talent show come together to share stories. They haven't seen each other as a group all this time. Expecting to hear only happy updates from each other they are surprised to find out every one of them has been struggling with the same kind of issues all this time. Becoming famous over night due to a TV show and then having to find your own way in life without this fame has proven to be a challenge. Director Emma Westermann lets them tell their story in a very personal and honest way - behind the glitter and glamour this documentary shows the reality of a reality show.
