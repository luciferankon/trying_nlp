When the Crash of August 1998 devastates the Russian economy the comfortable routine lives of four "New Russians" are changed forever. Muscovite Cyril (Konstantin Khabensky) loses his profitable publishing house. Peter (Artur Vakha) whose beloved wife recently died leaves his now failing medical practice to drive a cab. Oleg (Aleksandr Domogarov) who left a provincial theater for a starring role in a major motion picture is left unemployed when the movie goes bankrupt and production stops. Their lives and the life of Zhenya (Dina Korzun) a photographer from St. Petersburg are drawn together when Cyril's Volvo collides with a Saab on a highway. While the drivers are sorting out the accident Cyril notices the other driver's beautiful and charming mistress Zhenya and falls in love with her. Before it is over Zhenya who had abandoned all hope of ever loving or being loved will discover that she is capable of feeling true love and become willing to struggle for it.
