There are 140 miles of unprotected coastline between the Channel Islands and Monterey Sanctuaries. To win federal environmental protection for this coastline Fred Collins and a team of professionals have worked to create a proposal for a Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. Because the local fishing community has opposed the designation process Fred Collins and other supporters are speaking out to address the concerns of that community and to explain the significance of the area they seek to protect.
