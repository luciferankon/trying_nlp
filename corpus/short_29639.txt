As a member of an international counter-terrorism organization Lacy takes her job seriously. When a sting goes bad she's left asking questions as the terrorists get away with a live bio-weapon. They set off the weapon in a school and Lacy's handler orders her to stand down so he can call in the big guns but she refuses. Her sense of responsibility and vengeance send her off to right what she made wrong.
