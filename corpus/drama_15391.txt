We follow Isaac on his journey from a broken relationship in Phoenix to his old stomping grounds on the reservation. Living just a short drive away in town Isaac returns home to live with his mother in a housing section known as "the Circles." The lyrical name comes from the circular design of the neighborhood blocks With a bad situation behind him he comes back home to his old neighborhood and quickly gets reacquainted with his best friend Scooby (Mikhail Sundust) a young lady he grew up with named Sam (Danielle Mercado) and an old playmate now turned treacherous drug dealer named Cricket (Deran Martinez). Throughout his transition Isaac is guided by his mother Cheryl (Jackson Harris) his uncle Rudy and his family friend and mentor Henry (Myron Schurz). While Isaac maintains a job doing odd jobs around the local service center it is evident that his artistic talent is emerging and could be useful among beautification projects in the Community. One commission leads to another and Isaac finds his calling and thrives as an artist. If only life were that simple. His friend Scooby gets deeper into the underbelly of the graffiti scene as he risks life and limb to "bomb" around the reservation. What turned out to be a few chance meetings with Sam quickly blossoms into romance. However Cricket the renegade gangster who has a say over all that goes on in the Circles is there every step of the way to complicate and threaten Isaac Sam and Scooby. In Circles is an honest portrait of life among young people looking for answers and direction.
