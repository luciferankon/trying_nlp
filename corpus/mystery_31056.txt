Shot up in the backwoods of Alaska and wastelands of a salmon processing camp the film A Thoughtful Goodbye follows two friends on their way home. They stop and camp out for the night waiting catching up on rest trying to figure out how they relate to themselves. The following morning one of them is missing with no explanation. The film was shot simultaneously on Super 8 standard definition and high definition to pull apart and examine the character's intersections between identity memory love and projection. As one searches for meaning without a past the other struggles with his desires when they confuse memories. 'Sometimes I forget that I am not you and you are not me'.
