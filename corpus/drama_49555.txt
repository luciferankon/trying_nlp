A wonderful drama interpretation of the novel of the Nobel Laureate Naguib Mahfouz  tracking the life and death of members of an Egyptian family through generations since the era of Muhammad Ali founder of modern Egypt . The title's translation is ' Talk of the morning and the evening ' where morning symbolises birth and evening symbolises death.
