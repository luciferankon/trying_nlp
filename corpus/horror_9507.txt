Three people from a big city arrive in a godforsaken village to an old deserted house which belonged to the grandmother of one of them. According to a testament this house should belong to a person who would be able to stay there for more than three days and nights. It all seemed simple... But as usual in such stories there is one shag... The grandmother was a witch... And then pain and horror madness and evil in all gloomy and horrific splendor is called "Psychosis".
