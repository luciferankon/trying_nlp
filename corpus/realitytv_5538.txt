Varsity Inc. Presented by Old Spice will chronicle the 2007 season of the West Monroe (La.) High School Rebels - and the town's obsession with the game - as they fight to stay atop the Louisiana football heap. ESPN2's six-episode series will capture the frenzy and fervor surrounding the West Monroe Rebels as well as the personal struggles and triumphs of the players and coaches themselves. The team is one of the most successful in Division 1-5A having won six state championships and two national crowns since 1993. Called "West Monroe Mania" on Friday nights in the fall the stores close down early and everyone's either tailgating or talking strategy as game time grows near. On average some 13757 fans fill the Rebels' home stadium each game several hundreds more than the town population of West Monroe .
