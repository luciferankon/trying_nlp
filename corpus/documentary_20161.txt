Dancing With Thoreau is a unique environmental film told from the perspective of a naturalist and organic farmer focusing on our individual and societal connection/disconnection with nature; what that means to us physically emotionally and spiritually; and how we as individuals can deepen that connection and reap its many benefits. A primary goal of the film is to inspire people to become more engaged in the wonders of their local environments. As a society we have become increasingly detached from the earth from where our food comes from and from the inner workings of life. Dancing With Thoreau is a film to point out the non physical important aspect of nature and how this aspect can is and will help to transform our material pursuits.
