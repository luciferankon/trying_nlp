At the highest levels in the show horse industry horses are treated as commodities: bought trained to perform for a ribbon and sold once deemed of no monetary value. Cash Lovell Stables and Riding Academy based in Winston-Salem North Carolina in the late 90's championed the industry until co-founder Parker Lovell courageously "blew up the barn" - which is the day she stood up for the care of her horses and her daughter over the self-serving needs of her high-end trainers. As Parker and Cashlyn her 13 year-old all-around cowgirl daughter raised in the saddle rebuild their riding academy with an unpopular equine ethos they fight near bankruptcy and come to grips with the anniversary of the loss and demise of her beloved world championship trainer husband Cash Lovell whose name built their business empire. But through horsemanship and their love of the work they heal and create a new community.
