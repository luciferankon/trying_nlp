In 2011 the Creators (Mike and Jerry) declared to the Penny Arcade office that a reality show based on web comics must be done. After a year of research and a successful Kick starter stretch goal the stage had been set for 12 Artists flown from around the world to compete a cash prize and a year integrated into the Penny Arcade machine. Through a variety of events and challenges these 12 will fight claw write and draw until only one Artist remains. Friends may or may not be made.
