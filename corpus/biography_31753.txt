The legend that is the late Eric Fournier began as a name on You Tube connected to a bizarre creation called Shaye St John in extremely experimental short videos.( Shaye was a beautiful actress who had a severe accident and was rebuilt as a doll. Reclusive and insane she lives with her 'friend' Kiki who can levitate objects.) Eric's videos built a huge cult following which lead to the release of Shaye St John: The Triggers Compilation on DVD. Underground film maker Larry Wessel gathers images and interviews of many who knew Eric and knew of him to make this bold and mad documentary of the man himself.
