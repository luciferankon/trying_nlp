A biographical look at Carla Bruni (1967- ) from a privileged childhood surrounded by music to a modeling career success as a singer and songwriter and since 2008 France's First Lady the wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy. The structure us loosely chronological mixing contemporary interviews (with Bruni her mother and sister her friends and her manager) with footage of her singing. A few news clips show her in her public role. The emphasis is on her writing of music and lyrics and on her singing style. She looks back with gratitude at her luck and she looks ahead to performing live again and to being an old woman singing the blues.
