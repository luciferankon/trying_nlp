May 2000. Southern Lebanon. For 18 years now Israel's most controversial war drags on and on adding fragmented slivers of shattered lives to ashes of smoldering hopes. Up there on the hill overlooking the feathery fairy-tale clouds a hallucinatory body of boy-soldiers inhabited a world of petrified anguish coated with layers of innocence. Dispossessed and exiled they carried out unfathomable orders fighting invisible yet fatal phantoms; their gazes clouded with embittered wizened dread - the chilly stare of the sharpshooter masquerades the bewildered gape of the child who chases his evading innocence. Wasted they hang between the backdrop of earthly paradise and the engulfing abyss of raging inferno. The Beaufort Post has attained mythical status for generations of Israelis It's the site of one of the most controversial battles of the Israeli Army's occupation of Southern Lebanon. High up on this hill above a cluster of clouds a fortress of young soldiers lived and fought and died. Their war was hallucinatory and feral; these young men obeyed laws of their own making were ruled by fear loathing and an instinct for survival. They lived this way until May 24th 2000. That night the post was completely evacuated and destroyed. The Israeli Army withdrew from Lebanon ending 18 years of occupation. Wasted is the story of any battle in any war: it's about young people who are asked to give their lives for a mountain that will soon lose its significance.
