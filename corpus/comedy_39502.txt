A woman who has been kicked out of a boarding house by her landlady for nonpayment of rent sets out to get her revenge. She disguises herself as her rich twin sister and takes a room in the same boarding house. The landlady hoping to wangle some money out of her "new" tenant is the picture of servility and it's not long before a variety of different local characters swarm over the house looking to get their "piece of the pie" from this new "benefactor".
