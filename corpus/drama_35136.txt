Fate is a contemporary movie about the abandonment of the young mathematical and chess genius Kevin. His teenage mother is unable to cope with the ravages of modern life and the responsibility of looking after both herself and Kevin. She chooses the most selfish solution and simply walks away from it all. This unleashes a chain of events that lead her and Kevin in opposite directions. Kevin unfortunately bears the brunt of the consequences to his mother's action and after going from one foster home to the next he ends up homeless. For two decades the only things he cares about are skating beating everyone at chess and illegally attending Chemistry and Quantum Physics lectures at the local university. His superior intellect needs an outlet and so he builds his own makeshift laboratory to indulge in all things scientific. His idea of affection is pushing it away and he vows to never let anyone close to his heart lest they betray and hurt him again. This seems to be working for him until he meets his romantic and intellectual match in Diane. This becomes his most intriguing and beautiful challenge yet. But unbeknownst to him his world is about to turn upside down as the path that fate has for him collides with an unexpected checkmate.
