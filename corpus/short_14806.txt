The modern world tells us that our lives and families are fragmented disconnected and even meaningless in a vast heartless cosmos . . . but The Smallest Vessel teaches us a very different story-that we are an expression of an unfathomable Mystery and that our selves and our families are just the beginning of the "vessels" that contain each one of us. The Smallest Vessel shows us that we are much larger than we think that our selves families and communities are deeply connected with the Web of Life which in turn is connected to our Earth our solar system our galaxy even our Universe. The Smallest Vessel demonstrates how the Universe could not be one millimeter smaller and still be able to contain us. Join us on this journey of cosmic connection as we find our true place in the great mystery of the Universe-and how we never were separate from the great Infinite.
