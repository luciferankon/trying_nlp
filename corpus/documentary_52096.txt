It was the 18th century and while the great nations were conquering the new world and establishing a new order an ancient and time-honored system was struggling to survive in the mountain fastness of Scotland. Against the onslaught of mighty England ruled by a foreign prince the clansmen warriors desperately fought to hold on to their freedom and culture. Lead by a young exiled Scottish Prince who had never seen his native land the clansmen fought a final bloody and valiant war to preserve a way of life. Even in defeat they created a memory that would last through the ages of mighty clansmen who proudly fought against all odds and never bowed their heads.
