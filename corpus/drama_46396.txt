Sl치vka Hradilov치 ('Jirina Stepnickov치' (qv)) now almost in her sixties used to be a film star years ago. She keeps herself in good shape and occasionally appears in TV ads. She however does not conceal her desire to get a great film role. Her female friends of the same age whom she meets regularly admire her a little are envious of her a little but at the same time laugh at her behind her back. One day Sl치vka finally receives a film script.
