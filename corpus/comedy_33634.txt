Mike Works from Home is a comedy web series about your every day typical office drone with one major difference: he's convinced his pushover of a boss to let him work from home five days a week. He then goes out of his way to get himself into a series of increasingly absurd scenarios to keep up the appearance of being busy and also fend off boredom - all without having to do any *real* work. Despite his unique situation Mike faces the same challenges as anyone else working a 9-5: calling IT to reset his password shouting obscenities while forgetting he's on speakerphone stopping his maniacal Russian landlord from invading his apartment staging a fake cooking competition reality show for lunch and of course conducting an in-home performance review without wearing pants.
