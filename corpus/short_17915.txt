A short documentary featuring Jeremy a 24-year-old Parisian who has been collecting underground music since he purchased his first vinyl record at the age of 10. His unique and personal collection is now so large that it requires its own room. Most of these records were never heard by the mainstream population and/or have been forgotten. Yet Jeremy's interpretation of the term "underground" transcends coarse musical categorisation. Over a journey from the overcrowded and shambolic Champs-Elysees to the quiet tunnels secreted below the surface Jeremy considers terms of existence alternative to those widely accepted on the streets above.
