The story about an innocent teenage couple who grow a very good friendship between them. Belonging to a vital period of their time this is to say adolescence just with a beckon of sex their life changes. Actually I wanted to hit the core area of the education system of West Bengal. There is a very bad tendency amongst the parents that they try to hide things from the eyes of their children instead of explaining those. As a result of that the curiosity plays an important role behind their sub conscious minds. Sometimes in adolescence without getting proper explanation and driven by the thoughts at the back of their minds they commit many mistakes.
