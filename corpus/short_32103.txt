'House inAction' is a vernissage... a party... a moment of freedom when art plays with everyday home life. Each room contains an art happening: installation performance costume design video. The house turns into a gallery into a place of creation. It slowly starts moving suddenly fades out finds its complete expression in video. It leaves its mark... tells its story. House inAction is a little revolution.
