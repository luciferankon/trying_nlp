Julie Bataille is fed up with student jobs. At 23 with a 5-years university degree she wants to work for real. She meets Ben by chance at a job interview. He's a guy who chose to live by the day getting by with whatever crosses his path and small-time trafficking. Ben asks her to come and spend the summer with him in the South. Julie declines. Then one day on an impulse she leaves everything behind and joins him.
