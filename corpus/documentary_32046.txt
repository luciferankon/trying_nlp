In recent years climate science has come under increasing attack so concerned geologist Simon Lamb grabbed his camera and set out to explore the inside story of climate research. For over three years he followed scientists from a wide range of disciplines at work in the Arctic Antarctic Southern Ocean New Zealand Europe and the United States. They talk about their work their hopes and fears with a rare candor and directness resulting in an intimate portrait of the global community of researchers racing to understand our planet's changing climate and provide a compelling case for rising CO2 as the main cause.
