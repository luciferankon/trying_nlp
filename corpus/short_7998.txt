Imagine a rusted medieval film can having survived centuries a long lost D. W. Griffith / Georges Méličs co-production a film left to us from the Bronze Age a time when images were smelted and boiled rather than merely taken when they poured down like silver not to be fixed and washed but free to form and coagulate into unstable temporary molds mere holding patterns of faces places and things shape-shifting according to whim.
