Gina and Big Bird are babysitting Ernie's young cousin Ernestine and are keeping her entertained with Ernie's scrapbook containing photos of the times he's spent with his friend Bert. Each picture comes to life and we get to revisit some of Ernie's and Bert's wonderful (and often hilarious) adventures.
