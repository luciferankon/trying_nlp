In 1956 the Moln√°r family hastily fled the Hungarian Uprising away from Hungary. A grueling journey that leads to the Netherlands weeks later where the family is lovingly collected. The Polygon Journal filmed their arrival at Utrecht Central Station. Why they fled the family does not know until today. Father never wanted to talk about his role during the Student Uprising of '56. He took this secret with him his whole life. Also the flight and its traumatic anxiety that it caused has been a taboo in the family for 50 years. Years after father's death his wife and children decide to go to Hungary in search of answers to questions that were never allowed to be asked. Along the journey it seems that mother knows more than she ever told the children. Through a dramatic period in Hungarian history the film shows what the impact is when you have to flee your home country  away from family and friends. And also how that trauma affects the daily life and family relationships 50 years later. An experience that many 'new Dutch' (with or without dual nationality) will recognize.
