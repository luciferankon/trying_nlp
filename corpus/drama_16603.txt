Every year a taxi driver named Pichi (Hector Roterio) assembles a group of locals to train for the annual parade. At first glance they don't look promising. Sergio has clearly led a hard life and has already lost some of his teeth but turns out to be a surprisingly fluid dancer. Maria Eva tries to hold down an entry-level job but she comes alive teaching murga moves to the new girls. Under her watchful eye they practice the murga's bigbeat rhythms and its accompanying steps. Murga is a remnant of Argentina's former African communities but is now practiced by anyone in the neighborhood who can surrender to its pull.
