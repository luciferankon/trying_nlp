Three stories in one: Johnie (Jayne Mansfield) is married but her husband deserts her when she becomes pregnant. She changes her name to Mae and takes a job as a waitress. She falls in love but her fiancÃ© leaves her just as they're about to get married. So Mae changes her name to Eileen and becomes a prostitute.
