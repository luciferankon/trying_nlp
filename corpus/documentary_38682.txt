He soon discovers the story of an 85 year old Physicist named Christian Fronsdal who despite his age is currently sailing by himself from Panama to French Polynesia over the course of several weeks. After making contact through satellite communication Kevin is invited to join Captain Fronsdal on his catamaran so that Kevin can capture Fronsdal's adventure to then be made into a documentary film.

The search begins on a small atoll in French Polynesia called Fakarava. There Kevin discovers individuals from all around the world who participate in the pursuit to find the Captain. The quest intensifies into a philosophical adventure that pushes an intimate conversation surrounding some of life's biggest questions.
