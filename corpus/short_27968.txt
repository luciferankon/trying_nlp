Karl Gabler suffers a heart attack. He has already exceeded the average age of mortality and now his time has come. He dies. The widow Gisela passes through the fleshly disillusioning stations of farewell together with their son. The documentary "the death of one." traces the interplay between normality and individuality of such a process and expands the limits of documentary by using a setting similar to a laboratory. The movie isn't primarily aimed at tragedy but rather wants to activate the audience to reflect and to be eventually entertained.
