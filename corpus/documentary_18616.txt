In 2001 Judith and Alan Kilshaw hit the headlines after apparently adopting twin baby girls from America - paying for them on the Internet. This case of 'Baby Trading' reached the House of Commons where Prime Minister Tony Blair declared their actions 'deplorable'. The babies were taken into care and returned to the US social services. The Kilshaws and the mother Tranda Wecker who had 'sold her kids on the Internet' were vilified in the press and prevented from seeing the girls. But what was the real story? In 2005 this documentary revisits the story discovering the main players still fighting for the right to bring up the now 5 year old girls. The Kilshaws are trying to highlight their case by standing in the General Election and the mother is battling with the Missouri Supreme Court trying to prove she was only seeking a good home for the girls unable at the time to look after them herself and certainly never received any money for them. The daughters meanwhile are unaware they are adopted. This film follows the mother as she fights the adoptive parents through the courts for permanent care of her daughters...and tries to forget she ever met the Kilshaws who also say they want the babies back.
