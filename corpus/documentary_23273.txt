Kathy Gilleran is a twenty-year veteran police officer from Cortland New York a small town that sits in the snow-belt just south of Syracuse. Her son Aeryn is a researcher working at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in Vienna and a former Mr. Gay Austria. On October 31st 2007 Kathy receives a call from the U.N. with distressing news: Aeryn failed to show up for work for two days in a row. Kathy immediately flies overseas to find him. Upon arriving in Vienna she learns that the police have no interest in an investigation. Detectives tell Kathy that Aeryn had been at the Kaiserbr√ºndl - an exclusive men's sauna in downtown Vienna - on the evening of October 29th when he suffered an extreme and sudden emotional breakdown fled the sauna wearing only a towel ran naked through the city streets and jumped to his death into the Danube Canal. He was presumed dead and his disappearance written off as a suicide. Yet to Kathy the police explanation makes no sense especially because no body had been recovered. Alone short of funds yet with abundant resilience Kathy initiates her own painful quest for the truth. As she persists she encounters overt police intimidation abuse and homophobia. But as Kathy hones her instincts as a mother and her skills as a cop she finds contradictions in the police statements an aura of a conspiracy and ultimately discovers her own strength to keep fighting for her son.
