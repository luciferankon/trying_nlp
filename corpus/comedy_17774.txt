Adam Coretti is an anglo-Italian worldwide famous journalist. The pillars of his career are inflexibility and integrity. For these reasons people in power fear him. Agreeing on an interview with him is for a politician or a lobbyist a statement of honesty. However everyone is aware that being interviewed by him could also lead to unexpected and dramatic consequences. Someone who is well aware of it is Ludovico the middle man of the Italian Prime Minister who Adam Coretti wants to interview. The prime minister is living a very delicate moment. He is losing people's support and all the surveys on him are quite negative. Therefore he is forced to accept the interview. The interview itself is the core of the movie. It is a match in which all the key themes of the film are discussed: speculative finance which has put politic aside limitation of freedom of speech and expression. "Sweet Democracy" is a movie built on two different cinematic languages: fiction and documentary. This combination allowed director Michele Diom≈ï to involve in the project the Noble Prize winner actor and writer Dario Fo.
