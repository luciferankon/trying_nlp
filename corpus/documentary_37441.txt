50 international architects along with several artists were invited by the Max Protetch gallery in New York to submit design proposals for a new World Trade Center and memorial. The exhibition entitled "A New World Trade Center: Design Proposals" opened four months after the attacks and attracted unparalleled crowds. Its intention was to contribute to the discussion by allowing artists and architects to freely re-imagine the site. In the video 20 architects participate explaining their proposals and commenting on the meaning of the attack. "After September 11th: Re-imagining Manhattan's Downtown" reveals their views on design the urbanism of downtown Manhattan and the political fallout following September 11th.
