On December 6 1989 14 young women at Montréal's Ecole Polytechnique were systematically hunted down and shot to death in what became known as the Montréal Massacre. Within hours everyone knew the name of the murderer but few would remember the names of the women. As Canadians denied the connection between this horrific mass murder of women a band of Vancouver feminists set out to create Canada's first national monument to name and remember the 14 women. Marker of Change: The Story of the Women's Monument documents their seven year struggle to create "something loving something permanent" for all women murdered by men.
