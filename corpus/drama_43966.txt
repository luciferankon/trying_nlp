Illusion is a 90 minute feature based on a play. It is filmed in one location with 4 main characters. 3 men meet on a nightly basis to discuss the work day. Mike is the boss waching over the bar from his vantage point in the corner. Paul and Jake have to tolerate his nightly rantings as does Maria the barmaid. As circumstances change the comical banter changes to frustration and arguements. This is a story of lost ambition and trust in a fast changing world.
