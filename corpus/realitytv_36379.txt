What you are about to see is an iPheature. It was shot entirely on an iPhone over a period of six months in two countries. At the time the individual shots were taken no plan existed as to their eventual use. They were shot whenever however and wherever the philmmaker intended for whatever reason existed at the time of their philming. Once the iPhone memory was full the individual shots were edited together in chronological order each shot separated by a one second gap. Whatever interpretation or meaning you as a viewer ascribe to this iPheature is entirely of your own device. Perhaps it has no meaning. Perhaps it is just a chronological fragmented assembly of phootage covering six months in the philm-maker's life. But then perhaps not.
