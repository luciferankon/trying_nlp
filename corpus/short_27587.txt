This entry (#3 in the "Believe It or Not" series) is set on a ship bound for home where reporters ask passenger Bob Ripley what he has seen in his world travels. He describes various oddities including a couple who were married for 147 years and a man who fathered 888 children. He sketches some of the oddities for a reporter to take to his editor and introduces passenger Clarence E. Willard who demonstrates that he can grow as much as 7 inches in a minute or so. In this third entry in the series we see Mr. Ripley about to disembark from a ship. Reporters greet him on the deck and ask him to describe what he has seen on his travels. Among the fascinating facts he discovered was the it is possible to catch deep sea fish in the Sahara Desert and you can freeze in Africa's Atlas Mountains. He also learned that England's King George I didn't speak a work of English and that rickshaws used in Hong Kong were invented by an American and are built in the state of New Jersey USA. Lastly we are introduced to 'Clarence E. Willard' (qv). By using muscular and skeletal coordination and control he can vary his height by as much as 7 inches.
