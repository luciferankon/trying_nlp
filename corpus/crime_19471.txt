A young couple Jiles and Molly Ralstons organize a boarding house 30 miles away from London. The opening of the institution falls on a day of heavy snowfall so that the guests arriving here seem to be cut off from the world. On the radio they report the murder of the former hostess of the farm where the boy died from torture but first of all this does not care much. Suddenly a policeman arrives at the boarding house on skiing informing that soon there will probably be a murder.
