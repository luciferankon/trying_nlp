Young Finnish filmmaker Harju's disturbing raw film gets up close to a psychotic man. We don't all live in the same reality. Nerve-wracking and frayed experimental fiction that shows a psychotic man and his direct surroundings in a totally uncompromising way. 'Our interaction with others is based on the idea that we all share the same reality. That turns out not always to be the case.'
