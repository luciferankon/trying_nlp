An entry in Universal's "Person-Oddities" series which was similar in theme to Paramount's "Unusual Occupations" series of shorts. The correct title is "Front Line Artists"---plural--- and the first story is about an exhibition of Canadian war artists' work in Ottawa. From there to Claremore Oklahoma to view the world's largest gun collection belonging to one man; bird houses built by soldiers in Camp Davis North Carolina; a collection of over 600 dolls belonging to a woman in Tulsa Oklahoma and then to a museum in Troy New York devoted to collars of all ages and fashions.
