The "sequel" to the Suicide Girls first movie--"Suicide Girls:The First Tour." While the first movie focused on the American Suicide Girls and their burlesque show this movie focuses on the international Suicide Girls and the photo shoots that they took outside and around the Italian villa that they stayed at.
