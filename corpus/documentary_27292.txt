If God is our pure all-loving creator can he really turn his back on sinners and allow them to suffer for eternity in hell? Where did this vision of hell come from? Is it possible we've got hell wrong? Or are recent challenges to the traditional view merely an attempt to avoid the inevitable? "Hellbound?" is a feature-length documentary that seeks to discover why we are so bound to the idea of hell and what our views on hell reveal about how we perceive God justice the Bible and ultimately ourselves. For many people belief in hell as a place of eternal torment for the wicked is an indisputable tenet of Christian orthodoxy. In their view rejecting or modifying this belief is tantamount to rejecting Christianity itself. But a growing number of believers disagree. They argue that we can have a loving God or we can have eternal hell but we can't have both. "Hellbound?" is a provocative critically acclaimed documentary that wades right into the center of this debate. Featuring interviews with controversial Mars Hill Church pastor Mark Driscoll; screenwriting guru (and atheist) Robert McKee; self-proclaimed exorcist Bob Larson; the purveyors of a "hell house" in Dallas TX; "Oderous Urungus" lead singer of the rock band GWAR; and the notorious Westboro Baptists Hellbound? presents a challenging eclectic and entertaining mixture of views from across the theological spectrum.
