UNCOVERED would lift the curtain and give a "behind the scene" look at a post-Revolution Arab Muslim country focusing on Homosexuality within the Tunisian society. Three LOVE Stories of LGBT couples who decided to take up the challenge of revealing their sexual tendencies with UNCOVERED faces. Talking about their emotional and sexual life; going through their everyday life routine Including violence discrimination indecent treatment they are subjected to; even by official authorities revealing a remarkable controversy between rejection and acceptance tolerance and condemnation of Homosexuality starting with "the Family" as the immediate circle of Homosexuals to the Tunisian authorities and more precisely the Tunisian Law and the blatant "normative Homophobia as stipulated by article 230 of the Penal Code that criminalizes "Sadomy" with up to 3 years in prison . In this sense an interesting but sadly shocking testimony made by a Tunisian gay person who was brought to trial based on the Anal Test in a very famous case in Tunisia. While we were working on the final touches of the documentary and during the Universal Periodic Review of the Human Rights Council in Geneva Tunisia accepted the following recommendation: "Immediately cease the practice of forced anal examinations of lesbian gay bisexual transgender and intersex persons which are contrary to its obligations under the Convention against Torture" However homosexuality is still illegal in the country.
