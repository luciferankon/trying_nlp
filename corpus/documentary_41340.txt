The heat is on for the world's biggest population of cheetahs. Namibia in Southern Africa is home to 3000 cheetahs but here they face the greatest challenges. In the north a remarkable family of seven cheetahs struggle to survive the endless desert droughts on the scorched pans of Etosha. Meanwhile on the ranchland of the south a lone female tries to scrape a living on the fringes of civilisation. If she gets caught by a farmer more likely than not he will shoot her. But help is at hand.
