PROMISE brings us to Vilna in the interwar period. In spite of her poverty a mother foretell a bright future for Romain her 10-year-old son. The only one to believe her words is the aging Mr. Piekielny - but he also forces the boy to make him a curious promise: a promise that only time can tell if Romain will keep. This piece of reality is described by the French diplomat and writer Romain Gary in his autobiography Promise At Dawn. The three directors made a promise to each other and transformed this into the film PROMISE.
