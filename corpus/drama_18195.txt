Eight high school aged boys spend a weekend of their summer at a religious camp entitled Camp William. The camp is known to help kids find themselves and their faith through the assistance of their fellow campers and their leading proctor Lance Clemons. Although none of them are necessarily friends going into the camp each kid begins to feel comfortable with each other as the camp rolls on and their identities begin to unfold before them. In the end they all leave as brothers thanks to the events they experience which help them bond and discover who they truly are.
