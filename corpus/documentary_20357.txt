The dialectic fields of tension in which Alexander J. Seiler moves lie between home and abroad form and content artistic quality and quantity. In an hour long discussion of his life's work as a film author he formulates a personal balance in front of a running camera that is of great interest not only to aspiring filmmakers and cinema lovers. Films such as "Früchte der Arbeit" (Fruits of labour) "Ludwig Hohl - Ein Film in Fragmenten" (Ludwig Hohl - A film in fragments) or "Palaver Palaver - Eine schweizerische Herbstchronik 1989" (Palaver palaver - A Swiss autumn chronicle) are important documents of Swiss cultural history with a socio-critical approach that still echoes in the present. PARLER MÉTIER weaves thoughts on the influence of artistic companions such as June Kovach Rob Gnant Max Frisch or Peter Bichsel with excerpts from Seiler's work. Besides the process of origin of the films their societal roots and the social reactions provoked by them are also discussed. Unusually self-critical and with a generous spirit of openness the past master speaks about the challenges he has faced over the last five decades while realising his artistic concepts.
