When poetry and music create a true collaboration whereby they can retain their distinctiveness and also serve a larger whole; that we call beauty. "Every Word has Power" is an illustration of such a collaboration. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel was more than poet and Basya Schechter is more than a musician. But in this one hour concert they both deploy their special craft in the service of the other. Heschel's words and Basya's melody. What results is beauty. Every Word Has Power: The Poetry of Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel celebrates Heschel's words with a concert performance of his poetry set to music by noted singer composer and musician Basya Schechter. This one-hour documentary began airing on ABC-affiliated stations nationwide in May 2015 and features Dr. Susannah Heschel Professor of Jewish Studies Dartmouth College; Peter Geffen founder of the Abraham Joshua Heschel School; Rabbi Shai Held author Abraham Joshua Heschel: The Call of Transcendence; and Dr. Edward Kaplan author Spiritual Radical Abraham Joshua Heschel in America 1940-1972.
