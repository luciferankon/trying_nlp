The film is essentially at its core all about growing up and about five people who struggle with this concept more than most. These five people (Alex Jonny Will Jodie and Becky) are united in this a collective and all they want is to be together and to escape everything that is confronting them. So extreme are their feelings on this that they plot to run away. This falls through and as the film progresses the inevitability of growing up hits them full on as they encounter very adult themes of love heartbreak responsibility addiction and death. The film tells the story of that often difficult always beautiful transitional period between childhood and adulthood - it celebrates that.
