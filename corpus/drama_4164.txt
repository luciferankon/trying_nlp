Photography student François leads a mostly carefree life in Québec spending most of his time hanging out with and photographing his girlfriend Genevičve. That life changes after his father Eugčne the family breadwinner gets laid off from his job at American owned J.W. Goldwater and Sons where he's worked for twenty years. Eugčne and many of his fellow employee's jobs have been mechanized and that particular factory sold. The men plan on holding continual solidarity protests - which includes not allowing other union employees to go to work - until they get their jobs back. Aspiring photographer François wants to document the protests on film. Believing the situation at Goldwater a systemic problem fostered by big business supportive provincial government policy a small faction of the union led by two men named Pierre and Fernand want to co-opt François as part of their team to work clandestinely to get the third place Independence Party led by Pierre Lemoyne into power at the upcoming Québec provincial election the plan which also includes using J.W. Goldwater the man. François' primary role is as photographer. He agrees as he agrees with this group's politics. François does not tell his family or Genevičve what he is doing as the activities of this group are illegal including kidnapping and bombing. As François gets deeper and deeper into the activities of the group something doesn't feel quite right to him especially as certain planned events get out of control. By the time he figures out what's going on it may be too late for him.
