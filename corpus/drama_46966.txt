One of the most popular plot lines in literature all around the world - and probably the favorite of women audiences - is the story of a handsome prince who saves a beautiful young woman or raises her up out of poverty and misery grants her wishes gives her his love and - of course - a throne which she certainly deserves because of her kindness beauty and various other wonderful qualities. The variations on this theme are countless from the classic "Cinderella" or "Scarlet Sails" to Chaplin's "City Lights." But we all know that a romantic story is one thing while life is alas something else altogether. And that "something else" depends on the country and era. Our story takes place in today's Russia and that explains a great deal.
