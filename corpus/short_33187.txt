Attracted by an advertisement in a newspaper that the celebrated palmist Madam Sybil can foretell the future of anybody Mr. Greenhead decides to make an investment. After getting his money the palmist gives him a mysterious box and he is instructed to gaze carefully through the crystals it contains. He cautiously places one of his "optics" at the point of view and proceeds to obtain some startling ideas as to his future welfare. A series of dissected lines the basis of many illustrated phases of life appear with extraordinary effect assuming most grotesque forms as they build up in illustration of virtues good and bad beauty and ugliness riches and poverty love conquests etc. At the conclusion he leaves dissatisfied because he did not get his money's worth.
