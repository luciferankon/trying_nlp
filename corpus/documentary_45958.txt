James Benning's "Four Corners" uses a specific geographical location to pose larger questions about the United States. Here the geographic and wholly imaginary place Four Corners that favorite tourist destination where Colorado New Mexico Arizona and Utah meet becomes a kind of theoretical ground zero the site from which Benning can give voice to other pointedly unofficial American stories .... This is a film in which sound and image are not joined together in some sort of spurious conspiracy (the history of the United States) but one in which each sound and each image hints at a story not yet fully told (the histories of the United States).
