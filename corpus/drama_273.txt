Jacob a struggling Chicago graffiti artist- turned-painter hustles haircuts and marijuana to support his art. During the week leading up to the Puerto Rican parade he receives an unlikely offer to have his paintings represented by a major art gallery. A beautiful young art consultant and daughter of the community Alderman Paris Rolon introduces Jacob to the world of high art and an opportunity to leave Humboldt Park in his past. His golden opportunity is threatened when his family and friends place demands on him to make an allegiance to the neighborhood revolting against the young white professionals gentrifying their community and the politicians' rumors of removing the seventy-five foot Puerto Rican flags statues that border the neighborhood.
