A Bite For Peace is a traveling family style dining experience created by chef and restaurant owner Natalia Pereira. We invite everyone from every corner of the world to sit with us at our table to join us in our mission to promote peace and build communities across the globe through the ceremony of sharing a home-cooked meal. "Food is a universal language. To sit around a table with each other is an important ritual because it gives us the chance to connect - even if we have nothing in common food has the power to bring people together. At that moment we are all equal. It doesn't matter where you come from we all need food just as much as we need empathy respect and compassion." - Natalia Pereira.
