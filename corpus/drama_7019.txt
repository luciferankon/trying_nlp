Nine years old Ihe Uwagwuma's family has recently been torn apart by hemp.Her mother has fled the home purportedly to escape the destructiveness of her father's alcohol-influenced insanity and her father has retired to drugs and alcohol purportedly to escape the devastation from loosing his wife to an age-long rival who he claims she has eloped with. Ihe is thus left with fending for herself and her five years old brother but her big challenge rather is in fending off her alcoholic father's aggression and the aggression of the bullies of the hood who then found her vulnerable.
