In the far western part of Mongolia the tradition of hunting with eagles continues to pass from generation to generation. The Kazakhs who live in this harsh cold region rely on their trained golden eagles for hunting bright red foxes in the winter. As the eagles roam the skies they easily spot the foxes below to bring as prizes to the hunters. Only around 250 eagle hunters remain yet they preserve their tradition by teaching their children the practice from an early age.
