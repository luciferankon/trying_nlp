An Emmy-nominated public/current affairs program documenting and honoring the history of Lakeside. This film examines the six hundred acres of undeveloped land on the south side of Chicago that was once home to US Steel's mighty South Works steel plant and makes the case for why Lakeside is an ideal site for the Barack Obama Presidential Library. Although it was ultimately decided to build the Library on the campus of the University of Chicago Lakeside remains an impressive parcel of land and was a serious contender. It was in the South Shore neighborhood around the former steel mill where a young Barack Obama first worked in Chicago as a community organizer and is where he launched his political career. Lakeside is being developed as a brand new residential commercial and industrial "second downtown" for the City of Chicago and is a multi-decades-long and ever-evolving endeavor.
