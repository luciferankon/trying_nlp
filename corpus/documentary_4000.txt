The film details the life of a tough impoverished kid who rose through the ranks of Chicago's underworld to become a top member-many say the real godfather-of the most ruthless gangland organization in the country: The Outfit run by Al Capone. Giancana was purported to have helped get JFK elected president as well as being hired by the CIA. It also showcases the Giancana daughters who best knew their father as a loving family man.
