BAM or Baikal - Amur Magistral was Leonid Brezhnev's plan to build more than 3500 km of railroad and 200 stations and communities in five years in Southern Siberia. The work was to be done mainly by Komsomol elite youths. BAM - Railroad to Nowhere is a documentary about the pioneering spirit about people who built the future with their own hands and how today they are trying to hold on to it even if the rest of the world would like to forget them.
