Over 130000 Australian horses served in the Great War of 1914-18. Nearly 30000 were engaged in the Middle East. Popularly known as 'Walers' it was in the desert sands that their legend was born. They carried their men to victory on the long road to Damascus but at war's end they did not come home. This is the story of their colonial origins their gallant service and their shameful fate. Great War Horses takes us on an epic journey from the outback of Australia across the vast Indian Ocean to the pyramids of Egypt the living hell that was Gallipoli and the unforgiving desert sands of the Middle East. After the disaster of Gallipoli and with the Ottoman Turks threatening the Suez Canal regiments of the Australian Light Horse were to undertake a grueling three-year campaign to drive the Turks from the Sinai and Palestine culminating in the 'Great Ride' through the Jordan Valley and the capture of Damascus. This epic desert war couldn't have been undertaken without the horses or the small army of horse breakers veterinarians farriers saddlers and feed suppliers that were essential to keeping thousands of horses in the field and battle-ready. Intense bonds between man and horse developed and the loss of a horse in battle was a harrowing experience. For the first time Great War Horses goes behind the legend of two celebrated partnerships: Michael Shanahan and 'Bill the Bastard' and Guy Haydon and 'Midnight'. And ultimately it reveals why our horses did not come home.
