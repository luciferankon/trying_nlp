In December 1995 something happened that will never happen again. For one sizzling week the frozen plains of western Canada played host to the historic final tour of two of the world's great traditional music icons - Frankie Yankovic and Walter Ostanek. Frankie Yankovic is the almost mythical American Polka King the originator of the modern musical form and the main reason the Polka flourishes today. Walter Ostanek is the premier Canadian Polka artist winner of multiple Grammy awards and heir apparent to the international Polka throne. Touring together one more time during one of the coldest winters on record - Frankie at age 80 has announced his retirement from the road . . . for now - the program features performances of Frankie and Walter's classic tunes interviews with the two stars as well as a behind- the-scenes look at the tour itself - everything that goes into the making of what Frankie Yankovic has termed "the happiest music this side of heaven."
