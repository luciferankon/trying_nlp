Life was cruising for the Moeller family. Mike and Cathy had a great marriage and four wonderful children. Things couldn't have been better. Then in October of 2001 the Moellers' second-oldest daughter Morgan became deathly ill. A rare complication quickly resulted in brain damage. The doctors said she'd never recover. Morgan's family prayed for the nightmare to end. But God had other plans.
