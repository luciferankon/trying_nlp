Aaron's father's funeral is today at the family home and everything goes wrong: the funeral home delivers the wrong body; a cousin gives her fiancé a Valium from her brother's apartment not knowing her brother is dealing drugs - it's LSD and the fiancé arrives at the funeral wildly stoned; Aaron's younger brother Ryan a successful writer flies in from New York broke but arrogant; one uncle is angry over his daughter's choice of boyfriends and the other is cranky and coarse. Add an ovulating wife a jealous ex-boyfriend and a short stranger who wants a word with Aaron - what could he want? Would another death solve Aaron's problems? And what about the eulogy? During their father's funeral ceremony Aaron and Ryan met a dwarf who reveals himself as the secret lover of their late father and threatens to reveal compromising photos unless he is paid $30000. But after the dwarf mistakenly dies they plan to hide his dead body in their father's coffin to be buried along with it and the things run out of control. Aaron's father unexpectedly passes away and he is called upon to inform his entire extended family to attend the funeral. After the funeral home delivers the wrong body things appear to calm down. Relatives and friends pour in - including a grouchy wheel-chair bound uncle; Aaron's New York-based selfish brother - an unsuccessful writer; drug-impaired cousins; and a petite stranger who no one seems to know - who has an agenda of his own.
