Three different stories whose central axis are radio listeners: several contestants have to get to a radio station studio dressed as Eskimo a thief answering a call in the house which is stealing and a school teacher who participates in a contest to get money to cure a child of his village. The stories are linked by the love story of a speaker and his fianc√©e and through interviews of real celebrities from the time of film.
