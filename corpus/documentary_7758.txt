Feature-length documentary of Britain's first and finest jazz-rock outfit 'Colosseum' from their beginnings in 1968 to their 1994 reunion tour to the recording sessions for 'Tomorrow's Blues' (1997) told in their own words by band members managers record producers and rock journalist Chris Welch. Formed in 1968 by former 'Graham Bond Organization' colleagues Jon Hiseman (drums) and Dick Heckstall-Smith (saxes) band also featured old friends Dave Greenslade (keys) and Tony Reeves (bass). They added guitarist James Litherland and scored record deal with Fontana ('Those about to die') later Bronze/Vertigo ('Valentyne Suite' Daughter of Time' 'Colosseum Live'). After extensive European tours and two albums under their belt they went for the States to perform with The Byrds Chicago Transit Authority etc at prestigious venues such as the San Francisco Fillmore in 1969. Back in Europe they changed line-up (Clem Clempson (guitar) and Chris Farlowe (vocals) replaced Reeves and Litherland) and continued to gain a reputation as one of the must-see live acts ('71 Bath Festival) of the era. Exhausted after 'three hectic years" they decided to call it a day in 1971 after release of their first live album showcasing the band in what is most likely their best environment: Live on stage in collective improvisation ranging from blues (Clempson / Heckstall-Smith / Hiseman / Farlowe) to jazz (Hiseman / Heckstall-Smith / Greenslade) rock (all) to soul (Farlowe). Due to increasing demand from fans all over Europe Colosseum rose from their 23-year hibernation to gain even more impressive stage power that enthused audiences ranging from Colosseum novices to old faithfuls and finally resulting in recording brand new original material in 1997.
