In 1999 Channel 4's Harry Hill Show loved by thousands was cancelled amid public outcry and rancour. Star and writer of the show Harry Hill has not spoken to the Badgers his Big Brother Alan Son Alan Burt Kwouk or any of the original cast since. As C4 celebrates its thirtieth birthday the gang look back at the series work out where it all went wrong and see if they can put their differences behind them and reunite for one last Reunion Special. An especially commissioned documentary which investigates the rise and fall of The Harry Hill Show which originally ran for three series on Channel 4 (19979899). We talk to the surviving members of the cast and the reclusive floppy collared genius who created it. We learn of Harry Hill's addiction to oily fish and how he used to beat the cast with a stick to get them to do things (a bit like the Orangutan on Every Which Way But Loose). We uncover details of Brother Alan's secret affair with Tasmin Archer Badger and Burt Kwouk's dislike of Harry's singing voice. The show features frank and sometimes shocking exclusive interviews with Harry Hill (TV Burp) Al Murray (A.K.A. The Pub Landlord) Burt Kwouk (The Pink Panther films Tenko) and Gary former Controller of Channel 4. Packed full of clips of the original three series the show is a fast moving and hilarious look back at one of Channel 4's best loved - and almost forgotten - shows.
