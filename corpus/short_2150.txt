From the world's highest peak to its deepest valley China is a land blessed with stunning natural wonders. But climate change and rapid industrialization are chipping away at these iconic landscapes. One of the country's leading movie stars Li Bing Bing joins a group of journalists and volunteers across modern China to the front lines of this environmental struggle. A mountain threatened by rising temperatures a river ravaged by violent storms and an inland salt lake that has been shrinking for over half a century. We follow the team of citizen volunteers and experts as they traverse the country in search of answers to one of China's most pressing modern issue: how to protect its ecological treasures and forge a sustainable future for generations to come.
