In February 2013 Emma Holbrook & Susannah Mo were devastated along with many others by the sudden closure of the Brewhouse Theatre and Arts Centre in Taunton Somerset and felt that something needed to be said. It was at that moment that they both began to set about making a short film that attempted to take a closer look at the more complex and wider issues that the closure of the Theatre raised. Making The Cut is an intensive overview of how cuts to regional arts funding in recent years have been affecting artistic infrastructure and communities all over the country with a particular focus on the south west. The film features a range of contributors from the comedian Mark Thomas playwright Max Stafford - Clark and Guardian journalist Judith Mackrell to local restaurateurs shop owners lecturers artists and community groups. The film deals with many issues such as the effects on the local economy education emerging talent and the local community. Making the Cut is a film that offers a simple message about the important role that the regional arts have to play in contributing to our local and national identities. The film offers no 'easy fix' solutions but uses many examples from all over the UK that demonstrate how other communities have been dealing with the crisis.
