An impossible dream. An undefeated perfect season. The fulfillment of a national championship. Pittsburgh Passion is the inside-look at the growing sport of women's full-contact football in the United States. The film profiles athletes from immeasurably different walks of life who overcame all physical and historical odds to pioneer a new sport for a nation. From backyard ball to screaming stadiums and from local newspapers to ESPN -- it is as much about the human heart and having dreams as it is about football.
