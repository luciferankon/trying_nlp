Shots of walking down 42nd Street showing storefronts including everything from Texas Fried Chicken to 25cent porn arcades. In between shots of the street are silly acts of violence such as a man being repeatedly stabbed in the eye with a skewer. This certain act is silly because the man has ground beef sitting on his eye and the skewer doesn't even touch that.
