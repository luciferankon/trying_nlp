Picture it: February 2012. 28 friends get together over a birthday weekend to make a film. Anyone that wants to act can act write can write etc. The only prompt is each scene has to somehow involve the concept of 'brunch' - brunch foods brunch conversation champagne whatever you like. The result is Brunch: The Movie 60+ minute absurd comedy featuring competing hotcake religions champagne messages from God and crumpets? You betcha.
