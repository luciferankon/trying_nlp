Petr was an urban man from a block of flats in Pilsen. He studied cybernetics at Charles University in Prague. His wife Simona grew up in a rich neighborhood in Prague and was studying Czech language and history at Charles University when she met Petr. Today they have been together for 25 years have nine children no running water no standard bathroom or toilet living all together in a caravan building on the meadow reducing their notion of an alternative life style ad absurdum. What's life like with a man who has used his own family for his lifestyle experiments?
