13 Miles is a sports drama about a champion at the height of his field and a woman who has sacrificed her dreams to help him achieve his. Split in two they turn to the sport that they know triathlon to find meaning and purpose in their own lives. 13 Miles is not about sports or competition but about how the power of our identity limits our humanity.
