Sadistic producer Vengeance commissions a new kind of reality show which he delightfully nicknames "snuff reality." Six people volunteer for what they think is a reality program filmed in the lap of luxury but find themselves in a dungeon. Hilarity ensues as the team now larger due to the addition of the biracial half-twins already squatting in the dungeon battles disease the producers' challenges starvation and a violent samurai.
