Police Chicks is a gritty ball-busting crime drama set in the back alleys of London's underbelly. Just kidding. It's a comedy set in L.A.'s Eastside the real Eastside. Two female undercover cops strive to keep their city safe while battling gangsters hipsters traffickers and anything else that ends in "ers". Written and Directed by Carlos Zelaya the show follows the two officers played by Nicole Ortega and Miriam Peniche as they deal with personal demons as well as the demons of the street. It will make you laugh cry and think about your mother. You should call her more often.
