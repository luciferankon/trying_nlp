An English-speaking woman who's off camera talks about what it means to be an Armenian even though she's never been there. On camera images move rapidly often looking as if a strip of film is being pulled quickly through the projector. Multiple images appear as well. The images are from Armenia: old churches landscapes faces buildings art people. She recites a string of place names. When the narrator is silent Armenian music plays. How does one explore one's cultural heritage from afar?
