In April 2006 Beth and Jerry MacKay founded Littleflick Pictures to produce short films. Their goal was to make a few shorts and submit the best to film festivals hoping for fame and glory down the road. 18 months later they had way more films than they bargained for. This feature-length collection of the first ten Littleflicks is sure to tickle your funny bone a serious medical condition which Littleflick won't be held responsible. Experience it all...the SUSPENSE of '120'...the WONDER of 'Life in 3D'...the RAGE of 'Overworked'...the ENERGY of 'Fireballs'. Let the funny be released!
