Lyndon B. Johnson: Succeeding Kennedy allows us to discover the legacy that was left behind by this great politician. Vice President to Kennedy Lyndon Johnson takes power at a time when the whole world was in shock : President Kennedy had just been assassinated. Known for his participation in the Vietnam War and little known for his "Great Society" legislation Johnson is the instigator of a new America. This audacious program includes laws that upheld civil rights which put an end to years of racism. The fact that Barack Obama is President of the United States is in part a consequence of what Lyndon Johnson put into place in the 1960s.
