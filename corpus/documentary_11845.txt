No car in the history of hot rodding is more revered talked about and written about than the 1932 Ford. Known as the DEUCE this car alone became THE icon of American hot rodding. Modified extensively by individual hot rodders the DEUCE epitomized sinister good looks and raw power. It has been used by Hollywood to symbolize youthful rebellion; by rock and rollers to capture the magic of an era and by artists as a canvas for exhibition and unique self-expression. As told by the renegade kids who gave the DEUCE its unprecedented role in American culture this acclaimed DEUCE video is the complete story of how and why the 1932 Ford rose to the incredible prominence it still holds in automotive history and hot rod culture.
