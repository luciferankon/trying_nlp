A small movie crew shooting a love scene in a wooded valley with Tammy and Pete is surprised by the appearance of Dolores a semi-nude woman who wanders through the background. The crew follows her in hopes of photographing her for the motion picture. They find Dolores and her friend Lee sunbathing amidst the rocks and waterfalls and the women invite the crew to picnic beside their cabin. After lunch Dolores and Lee row and swim in the lake while Tammy stays inside the cabin studying her script. Tammy grows restless takes off her nightgown and joins Dolores and Lee outside.
