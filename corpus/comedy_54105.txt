Good Teeth follows a contemporary slave trader over several decisive days in his career. Jack has had the standard workload. A crooked cop sells him a rich kid (who got into trouble one too many times) for export to Europe as a sex toy for an elderly heiress - a fine job one of the best you can get; he buys a few migrant workers from the detox center for immediate sale as farm labor; he picks up Thai take out all amongst a barrage of cell phones pagers and faxes that have been stretching his patience mighty thin. Beyond that corrupt cops travel agents representing disturbed clients shitty merchandise backstabbing by his peers in the industry and countless other annoying factors make Jack realize that this is no longer the business his family has been so proud to be in for generations. There is trouble amiss and Jack considers leaving the business. His best friend is killed in a raid and he is visited by his nighttime apparition as well as that of his deceased father. They tell him that before he gives up the business there's one more meaningful earth-shattering thing he must do.
