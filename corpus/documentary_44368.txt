Palm Springs' White Party is the backdrop for this documentary on the fast-paced world of gay circuit parties. Halpern and Rolov follow four young men: 23-year old straight-laced circuit virgin Brandon; 21-year old party boy with a drug problem Tone; and sensitive but strong-willed 19-year old Jon. Accompanying them is Jon's "soulmate" Todd a 35-year old businessman recklessly reliving his adolescence plus other "circuit friends" the boys make along the way. When Boys Fly pulls no punches in exposing this world - men are shown overdosing and engaging in risky behavior - but at the same time it also shows the sense of community and vitality the parties bring to the men who attend.
