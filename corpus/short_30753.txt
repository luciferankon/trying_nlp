The film is a satire on the present day society where creativity is killed every day either by Economic pressures or by Political corruptions. Even the common man suggestively shown as greedy Opportunists reject creativity since it gives them no tangible benefit. In a fast-moving world of economic obsession driven by dirty Politics it becomes extremely difficult for creativity (a Poem) to find its place. Poem or the creative spirit in a greater context has been personified as a beautiful and traditional young lady who keeps searching her Poet. She imagines her Poet to be her creator and her lover and she feels committed to him even though she knows that the Poet is dead. Rhyme depicted as an alter-ego of Poem is her only companion. In her search for Poet the Poem meets Economy Politics and Opportunists and comes to know that all of them have killed the Poet because creativity hurts them all in some way or the other. Poem and the Rhyme both committed to the Poet moves from their tormented present towards a dreamy past in search of their common lover.
