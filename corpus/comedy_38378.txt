Marta is the head reporter in a "seroius" magazine. Unfortunately it is currently not selling as good as it should so Andr√©s the magazine owner decides to hire a new boss to run it and turn it into a low-quality but highly profitable sensationalistic magazine. To Marta's chagrin and indignation--she had expected to be offered the job herself--the amoral and unprincipled new boss is no less than her own husband.
