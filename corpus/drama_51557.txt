This film reconstructs Elkunchwar's writings as his 'rehearsal' to look within himself to make sense of his inner world to understand and to break through the narcissistic indulgence of a creative artist in order to establish a real contact with the Other. In this continuous 'rehearsal' the writer turns himself into an actor inventing imaginary voices characters personas to enter in to a 'dialogue' with oneself a dialogue which paradoxically becomes a 'monologue' ceaselessly longing for the other voice. In this imploding 'monologue' the 'fictional' merges into and mirrors the 'autobiographical' to such an extent that one wonders which one is 'real' and which one is 'imaginary'? Is the 'Other' a mere reflection of the 'Self' or is the so called 'Self' a reflection of the 'Other'? In this 'hall of mirrors' an eight year old child is witnessing these verbose 'rehearsals' these 'monologues' without speaking a word. What is the secret of his silence? Are these ceaseless 'monologues' stemming from his imploding silence? Is it a rehearsal of Man and Woman separated from one another as a child searches for his lost Home? This film grapples with these questions while constructing a narrative of Elkunchwar's journey both literary and spiritual.
