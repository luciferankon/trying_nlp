The Peruvian Amazon which encompasses some 300000 square miles is a highly bio-diverse landscape larger than the state of Texas. For its size it is very sparsely inhabited - it takes up 60% of Peru's landmass but is only home to about 5% of the country's 30 million people. This 5% is made up primarily of indigenous people some of them having had minimal contact with the outside world. But the region is under threat from two vastly different but interconnected sources: resource extraction and climate change. Beneath The Canopy is a story about members of the Achuar indigenous group and their ongoing effort to confront these modern day plights - an endeavor they have undertaken in a way that both honors their heritage and prioritizes future generations. The 11000 or so Achuar inhabiting the area derive their entire way of life and sense of place in the universe from the surrounding forest which they believe they have been living in since the beginning of time.
