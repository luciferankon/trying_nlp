THE FORGOTTEN ARMY tells the story of some ex-soldiers of former East Germany who nearly 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall still struggle with the loss of their homeland and identify with an army that doesn't exist anymore. These men all did what they were told to do confident that it was the right thing. Nonetheless they were caught in a dilemma: being faithful to your oath could also mean to spy on your neighbors and - as a last consequence - shoot at your own people trying to escape to the West.
