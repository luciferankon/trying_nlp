When Michael wakes up he is horrified to find that he is riding shotgun with a psychopath who reveals to him that his family is held captive in the attached cargo trailer. The trailer is rigged to release a deadly toxin when triggered by a switch in the car. Thinking of his family's safety he cooperates with everything the psychotic driver asks him to do even if it means breaking the law. During this bizarre ride the driver subjects Michael to three horrific tales of the macabre including a demon that takes a mother (Lynn Lowry- George Romero's The Crazies David Cronenberg's Shivers) on a journey of self discovery and reveals to her the horrifying truth behind her son's suicide. The next tale transpires in the 80s where a Detective is hot on the trail of a serial killer known as The Sledgehammer who is terrorizing a video store owner and his wife. In the final tale an evil deity is using the human body as a host to possess its victims. When the deity destroys one victim it jumps to another causing an epidemic of possessions being reported. With a burning desire for the truth behind his abduction and the safety of his family will Michael have the will to survive the madness? Your sanity will be tried and tested in Terror Tales.
