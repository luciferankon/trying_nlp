Five young people have gone away camping for a week and have switched off all their phones etc when they come back they noticed how absorbed everyone is by their phones to such an extent that they have become solely focused upon it. They try to distract people from it but as time goes on everyone becomes more and more dependent on technology and they end up unable to do anything vaguely human like and these young people are the only people who are not affected by it and they try to get everyone to put their phones away and return the world to when it had life and vibrancy not pixels and texts.
