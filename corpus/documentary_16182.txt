In 1961 a three year old chimpanzee named Ham rocketed into outer space propelling the U.S. a step closer to manned space flight. Ten months later he was followed by Enos the five year old chimp who soared into orbit paving the way for John Glenn's momentous journey. The space chimps received worldwide attention for their triumphs but faded from glory once their services were no longer needed but their journey didn't end there. The story reveals the space chimps triumphs and tragedies and brings to light the virtually unknown account of how the colony was rewarded for their long and challenging service to NASA the Air Force and the United States.
