Descius Heiss is a French expatriate and former Devil's Island prisoner with two passions; driving shrewd bargains in antiques at his Sly Corner Shop and the care of his Beautiful violin-playing daughter Margaret. But his comfortable wealth comes more from being a fence for stolen goods than it does buying-and-selling antiques. His secret is discovered by his shop assistant Archie Fellowes (Kenneth Griffith) a nasty sniveling young scroat who keeps blackmailing Heiss until he goes to far. The film ends in a London concert-hall where Margaret is playing the Mendelssohm Violin Concerto.
