The story opens twenty years ago with life and death exile under gunfire from the Res of 14 year old Freddie Black Elk who is driven into the storm of the century by his criminal father and goon squad enforcers. Fate intervenes to save the teenager when kind-hearted white farm couple find near-dead Freddie on a frozen rural road and save his life. Freddie makes his way out to the Southwest where the FEDS recognize and train him to infiltrate Indian casinos for immunity from street crimes. Ten years later first generation Hispanic Donnie Right has to grow up in a hurry when his father and younger brother are killed by blue-blood La Jolla DWI banker serial manslaughterer Gerry Plentiful Jr. Donnie is the protagonist who helps his surviving mother teenage sister and undocumented workers who travel back and forth from Ensenada into the United States to feed their impoverished families. Freddie and Donnie's ironic parallel connections and eventual intersection are their almost identical physical appearances as "dopplegangers" which leads to police charging Donnie for a felony murder crime committed by Freddie. Donnie is misidentified by bank employees and by the end all three principals Donnie Freddie and Gerry will die: the first tragically in police profile gone wrong; the informant's cover is blown and the third drives drunk one time too many.
