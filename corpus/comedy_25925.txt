Jim Bruer's Heavy Metal Comedy was born on December 9th 2000 when Jim unleashed his Rock-n-Comedy assault on an unsuspecting standing room only crowd at New York City's Irving Plaza. New routines such as "Coming Home at 4am" have already become cult faves and Bruer favorites like "The Party" have received a musical facelift. Jim's uncanny impressions such as Brian Johnson of AC/DC are also included in this DVd. Bonus material includes a 50-minute Heavy Metal documentary.
