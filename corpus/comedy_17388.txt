Rhod starts off at the WRU center of excellence to learn how to be a Rugby Union coach having played the game for 15 years. He pretends that he knows nothing about the role for comedic effect but he really does know what is what. That is until he he is handed a team of 8-year-olds and a female player proves to be his match at being in charge. Overall good laugh if you know Rhod's style and a little bit about the game.
