A meditation on moments when life teeters on a cliff when memories of the unstable world enter the safe suburban kitchen. A series of interviews with my father acrobats at a circus a car on fire in the parking lot outside my apartment. Nothing is safe enough from the possiblity of falling. Re-photographed Super-8 film cut with digital video.
