It's easy to bemoan our political leaders. No doubt we expect too much from them. They are after all no more than elected public officials. We vote them into office to represent us. But when they fail to represent the will of the people and the nation we need to replace them and find individuals that will. SOMEBODY is about people exercising their right to peacefully gather speak and demonstrate - one of the most basic emblems of democracy. SOMEBODY is about each of us.
