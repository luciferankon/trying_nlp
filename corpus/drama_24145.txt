Prodced during the earliest days of television this program was essentially a series of short stage plays performed in front of a camera. Filmed in Chicago and starring little-known local actors and actresses in half-hour dramas this show lasted for just under a year during which time it went through two name changes being later known as "ABC Tele-Players" and "ABC Penthouse Players."
