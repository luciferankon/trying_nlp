My seven year old asked me: "How do people change their minds? How do they really change themselves? - not like in the movies" Return to Grace is a series of 9 short abstract films that explores this transformation through the inventive eyes of children and is presented as 'moving paintings' using the rhythms of breathing to create a hypnotic and trance like experience.
