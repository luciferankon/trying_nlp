One of the bottom-of-the-barrel cheap-jack films from Robert J. Horner's Cosmos Produtions Inc. This one is about 50% filled with archive footage rodeo scenes inserted here and there but the disjointed rodeo footage has more logic and continuity than the plot; Rodeo rider Jack Perrin captures and tames a wild horse Starlight and impresses rodeo girl Josephine Hill but rodeo villain Fred Church has a yen or something for Miss Hill also so he cuts a stirrup on Jack's saddle to get rid of him. Jack don't need two stirrups.Church has no lines probably because Horner forgot to write him any but he excels at silent simmering and yenning.
