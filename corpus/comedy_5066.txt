San Francisco debutante Jessica Poole is marrying Napa Valley cattle rancher Roger Henderson and hopes her peripatetic father "Pogo" Poole whom she hasn't seen for years comes to the wedding. He arrives disrupting the household of his ex-wife Katharine and her long-suffering husband and befriending their cook Toy. At first it seems that Pogo is set on breaking up the engagement making up for years of neglect by wining and dining Jessica showing up Roger as a hick and enticing her to come to Europe with him. Then it seems his real goal is to win back Katharine's heart: why else would he have two tickets to Paris booked on a plane leaving right after the reception?
