With the idea to document the final year of High School several students go everywhere with a camcorder to get all the feelings and goings-on of a High School Senior from the halls of school to the most fun of things. Until it gets to deep and one person is unable to handle what happens someone takes the fall for the entire well prank a LOT too far. Pop that popcorn and get ready for a really good movie that will keep you on the edge of your seats... Sort of a "Blair Witch Project" mixed with "I know what you did last Summer"..... Enjoy!!
