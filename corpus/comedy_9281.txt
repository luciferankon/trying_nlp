Six former members of "The Brady Bunch" cast reunited for this episode which centered on Ross' dream about living with TV's "lovely lady" (who had "three very lovely girls" all with hair of gold) and "a man named Brady who was busy with three boys of his own." Brian and Kate have had enough of Ross' poor grades and confront him about it. Ross doesn't see what's the matter explaining that he was merely watching a "Brady Bunch" marathon (and that by missing one episode he loses the flow). Brian and Kate are even more upset at Ross' nonchalant attitude prompting Ross to bemoan aloud that Mike Brady "would never yell at me" because of bad grades. Ross falls asleep and finds himself in the middle of the opening credits of "The Brady Bunch." It isn't long before Ross learns that he is the Bradys' "long-lost son" Chuck. "Chuck" gets his hair permed (at Mike's suggestion) then begins visiting with various family members who reprise the scenes of the Brady's most popular episodes (e.g. "The Subject Was Noses" "A Fistful of Reasons" etc.). "Chuck" then consults Mike about his poor grades. After Mike gives him advice that Ross finds somewhat satisfactory the Bradys begin repeating their dialogue. "Chuck" asks what's going on to which Mike explains that everything is a rerun. Things quickly become chaotic and Ross awakens from his dream vowing to study harder.
