In April 1945 Vojtech GÃ¡l was murdered on the way from Sachsenhausen to Schwerin. In April 2008 his son walked the same route in an attempt to find his father's grave and leave a testimony. Friends and fellow pilgrims accompanied him. They did not understand everything they came across. They could not comprehend some of the people with whom they talked. They give harsh personal witness of their journey anticipating neither agreement nor tolerance.
