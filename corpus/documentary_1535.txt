Circle The Wagen is a feature-length buddy/road-trip/docu-dramedy that follows Dave an idealistic adventurer and automotive ne'er-do-well and his convivial co-pilot Charlie on their journey down Route 66 in a baby blue 1972 VW bus. Through mishaps and murals gasoline baths and breakdowns the two discover a teeming underground of vintage VW diehards willing to help save "The Croc" from the scrap heap and rally her beleaguered owner on to California.
