Harry Caines is the new Customs Surveyor or district head at Wrelling a small port on the Dorset Coast. His job as 'the new broom' is to shake up the office and keep one step ahead of the smugglers and criminals. He must land 'the big fish' behind the small-timers who ply back and forth across the English Channel.
