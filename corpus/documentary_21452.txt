Theatre on the Edge: Growing Art and Community at Double Edge Theatre is a new documentary following the internationally recognized laboratory theater company Double Edge a company that relocated from Boston to the rural town of Ashfield MA in search of a community connection they hadn't been able to find in the city. One of the guiding principles of Double Edge is the company's commitment to creating a rich exchange of "living culture" through its relationships with both international audiences and the local community. Other guiding principles are the company's intensive physical training for all company members and a philosophy of "actor-centered theater" which sees the actors as artists not interpreters of someone else's ideas. Double Edge performances extend that privilege to the audience as well often blurring traditional boundaries between performers and viewers. The result is a dream-like feast for the senses incorporating life-size puppets stilts swings live music and even the animals fields and ponds of the 100-acre farm on which Double Edge lives and works. Theatre on the Edge includes interviews with company members visiting theater directors and critics as well as community members and the audiences who attend the productions. The film will follow the company as they rehearse for their production The Garden of Intimacy and Desire a triptych that includes the productions The Disappearance The Republic of Dreams and the UnPOSSESSED. The film will also include rehearsals and performance of the company's summer production Arabian Nights a spectacle geared for a wide audience using the company's extraordinary farm as a set.
