Five meters deep two meters wide-ten square meters. At some point everything feels like home. Daniel a captain with the German Bundeswehr speaks almost lovingly about his small room inside a shipping container at his base in Kunduz Afghanistan. Daniel believes in what he is doing. "There is right and there is wrong. And I think we are the good guys." His six-month stint is almost over. He is looking forward to going home again. But he will return to Afghanistan. "This is the real life here" he says. Three kilometers down the road at the Afghan army barracks Lieutenant Mehdi talks about his tattoos. Several deep scars run across his upper arm: "Here were my initials and those of someone I loved. I married someone else so the tattoos had to go." Ever since he can remember Mehdi wanted to join the army. He sees no difference between the Afghan and the German soldiers. But he knows that eventually Daniel and the other German soldiers will return to their peaceful homes. He will return to his wife and son in Kabul which is safer than other places in Afghanistan. But even there the war is never far away. Side by Side: An intimate portrayal of two professional soldiers.
