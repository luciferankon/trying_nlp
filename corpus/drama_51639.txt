The Wednesday Morning Breakfast Club is a short film that tells the story of three older men who come into the same restaurant on Wednesday mornings at the same time every week. The story is told from the perspective of Megan the newly hired waitress at the restaurant. Through her deliberate acts of respect and purposeful efforts to get to know these gentlemen the shroud of their grumpy appearance is lifted and as the men open up the impact of their life stories extend beyond Megan.
