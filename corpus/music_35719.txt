Song Lyrics: We outta La Croix we outta La Croix. We outta La Croix man We Outta la Croix. Just finished snoring/office morning/the boss has coffee pouring/but that's boring I hit the fridge to slaughter/sparkling water/ but some *#$hole forgot to re-order. We outta La Croix we outta La Croix. We outta La Croix man We Outta la Croix. Someone please re-stock this office/ you got this?/ No way I'm drinking out of these faucets/enough you fools/don't wanna hear no excuse!/ Wheres my lime wheres my lemon where's my Pamplemousse? What'd you say?/ uh-uh - no way/ I am NOT drinking any Perrier today/ Call Office Depot people/before I get lethal/ and have to do something all illegal. We outta La Croix we outta La Croix. We outta La Croix man We Outta la Croix. - (c) 2016 by Zach Selwyn
