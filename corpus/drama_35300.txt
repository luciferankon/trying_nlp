Tells the story of Sadie and Bessie Delany two African-American (they preferred "colored") sisters who both lived past the age of 100. They grew up on a North Carolina college campus the daughters of the first African-American Episcopal bishop who was born a slave and a woman with an inter-racial background. With the support of each other and their family they survived encounters with racism and sexism in their own different ways. Sadie quietly and sweetly broke barriers to become the first African-American home-ec teacher in New York City while Bessie with her own brand of outspokenness became the second African-American dentist in New York City. At the ages of 103 and 101 they told their story to Amy Hill Hearth a white New York Times reporter who published an article about them. The overwhelming response launched a bestselling book a Broadway play and this film.
