Former child entertainer Shayne McGrath (of "Wow Mom" fame) hits rock bottom when his unsavory behavior can't even land him in the tabloids. With his shaky reputation on the line Shayne's clingy manager Kat Jacobs hatches a plan to repair his image and kick-start his comeback as a self-help guru with a feel-good PR video. In an effort to generate believable content for the video Shayne's manager arranges for seven of his few remaining fans to join him on a weekend trip to the country with promises of an unforgettable inspirational life- changing experience.
