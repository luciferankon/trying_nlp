After three years of being imprisoned in a crystal Spyro and Cynder stop the evil forces of darkness and confront the Dark Master Malefor and save the day! (spoilers) Cynder is starting to have feelings for Spyro at the end of this is the final conclusion in the series. In the new game for The Legend of Spyro trilogy even if the name posted in the outline isn't the one used I feel giving the PS3 system this final new Spyro game will actually benefit the company that produced the last one The Legend of Spyro Dawn of the Dragon It is in my personal means that by bringing the game back for one final showdown with new introductions new connections between spyro and cynder from the end of the last game and the bond shared by them to the end of everything to recreation of the planet that was being destroyed by Malefor. I can say doing a new upgrade to them looking twice as big more detail and more capable of higher flights new charging ability on the ground fighting moves evolved breath attacks Fury modes being unique to the elements Showing them fighting a new dark being and the new enemies that bring a challenge to the whole story. I in fact grew up playing spyro games and truely loved them So granting the ones who want Spyro to make a last apperance in this day and age would please many across the world. By giving a new look to them both making spyro stronger in size cynder slender and nimble but forceful and sharp it would add to a players enjoyment and bring along something the other games didn't possess and that's something i like to call Style and Imagination given power.
