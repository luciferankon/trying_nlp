In 2011 photographer Tanja Hollander decided to visit each one of her Facebook "friends" (all 626 of them) in their homes and make formal portraits of each of them. Armed with her cameras and iPhone Tanja traveled throughout the U.S. and around the world for 5 years meticulously documenting her experiences in real time and creating a historical narrative both visual and written along the way. Her project is an exploration of friendships the effects of social networks the intimate places we call home and the communities in which we live.
