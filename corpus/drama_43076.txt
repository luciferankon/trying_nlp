Six episodes in which ERWTJE constantly seems to 'loose' Oluifje and enjoys a new adventure. Oluifje never really panics and stamps her feet: "tap tap tap is what Oluifje does!" In the meanwhile the viewer gets involved in the different fictitious cultures as the adventurous kid witnesses a new musical exiting unexpected or strange spectacle. Eventually Oluifje always finds her ERWTJE even tough she doesn't understand one bit of the things he takes home after each adventure. The six episodes are: 'The Princes on the Pea' 'The gang' 'Mi Amore' 'Ching Kwong' 'The Mama' 'Fab Al Baba'
