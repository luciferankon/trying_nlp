In the pilot episode ("Is it hard?") we meet several of the personal trainers that work at Allen's Fit World. Chad and Doug (the two alpha-male trainers) immediately vie for the attentions and hopeful sexual conquest of a new trainer Sara. Little do they know Sara is a lesbian. Meanwhile Sara and (other trainer) Melanie deal with overbearing and "know-it-all" clients.
