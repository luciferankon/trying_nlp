Skinner is afraid to strike his employer for a raise for fear he will be discharged. Mrs. Skinner scoffs at his fears however and finally induces him to demand an increase. Her humble spouse gets the proverbial "cold feet" at the final moment; so to "cover up" before his wife he fibs a little and tells her he got the raise taking the money from his private bank account. She forthwith makes him purchase a dress suit and "spruce up." Although it almost wipes Skinner's bank account out he buys the clothes. Skinner is frantic; he sees the wolf at the door. But by virtue of his dress suit and good appearance he gets acquainted with some wealthy people and is enabled to put over a big business deal for his firm. Rushing into his company's office with the order he demands a raise and a partnership in the firm. He gets both. Skinner is too timid to ask his boss for a salary increase but also too timid to tell his wife he has not gotten it. He pretends to have received the raise and buys a new suit as proof. The stylish suit gives him confidence soon he has been transformed into the dynamic and successful man he had pretended to be.
