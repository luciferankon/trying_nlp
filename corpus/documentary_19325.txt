Four overweight Brits go junk food cold turkey in the mountains of Northern Pakistan. They've embarked on a daring journey to a hidden village with a big secret - it's home to one of the best diets in the world. For one month they will live with the people of Shimshal eating a simple and natural diet that has changed little in thousands of years. And in return the junk food addicts will make their hosts their favorite junk meals from back home - all served from a British kitchen they've brought out with them. What will the clean living people of Shimshal make of a greasy fry up and will the experience help the Brits rethink their bad diet back home? Thousands of miles away from the junk food they can't resist can they bin their bad eating habits once and for all?
