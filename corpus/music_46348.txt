Chris Penn (unrelated to the late actor of the same name or Sean Penn) a joint owner of Dallas Texas' Good Records goes through great lengths to get Dennis Dunaway the original bassist of Alice Cooper to hold a book signing at his store. Through a number of well-orchestrated efforts and many phone calls and emails the book signing expands to include a performance by Billion Dollar Babies the band consisting of the surviving original members of the original Alice Cooper group without the famed singer. Without any promises or guarantees from Alice Cooper himself Chris prepares to stage the possible reunion of his favorite band since childhood. On the night of the event Good Records is packed to the rafters with so many Alice Cooper fans some are forced to watch from outside through the windows. The excitement escalates as they anticipate the possible arrival of the originator of shock rock. Part documentary and part concert film this movie includes performances from the legendary night at Good Records.
