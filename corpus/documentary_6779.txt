Journey into Life follows the struggles of three concentration camp survivors-Yehuda Bacon of Israel Gerhard Durlacher of the Netherlands and Ruth Kluger of the United States-in rebuilding their lives after World War II. In on-camera interviews these extraordinary individuals discuss their childhood memories of Auschwitz internment in Displaced Persons camps and their search for a new homeland after World War II. Using U.S. Army archival film footage to illustrate these powerful stories Mitscherlich's film focuses on the subjects' attempts to cope with the psychological trauma of their experiences and to comprehend the meaning of the Holocaust.
