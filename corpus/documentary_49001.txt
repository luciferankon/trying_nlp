'Born Without' is a documentary about severely handicapped Mexican actor and musician Jose Flores. "Born without arms and other limbs Jose supports his large family by playing the harmonica throughout Mexico. In the face of adversity he shows great courage and spiritual strength. This is a film with multiple layers. It is about sharing daring and being grateful for what we have. It is also an exploration of social values some of them controversial. Many of Jose's choices have been strongly criticized by his family and people around him. As a result this is also a film about self discovery: a way to explore what we judge ... and what we choose to accept and forgive." - Director: Eva Norvind
