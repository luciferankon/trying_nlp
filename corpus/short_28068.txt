Mr. Karl Helmer is a progressive farmer who owns an estate in Alsace. He has just bought a new McCormick International 523 tractor. To learn why its purchase has become the most profitable one for his farm we observe a working day (August 29th) in the life of this tractor. A quick and easy pre-start inspection is followed by a full day of plowing and baling straw. The Agriomatic S transmission allows shuttling between forward and backward travel and between high and low speeds with the touch of a lever a big help in plowing. Operating the tractor and hay baler is so easy that Mr. Helmer's daughter has no problems finishing the baling. We also see other IH tractors and implements in action.
