We have witnessed how a roma baby Ilya was left by his mum for an international adoption in 1993. 20 years later the young Frenchman came to Bulgaria to visit his mother and his seven brothers and sisters. An emotional film for the collision of cultures. Other Bulgarian children found parents abroad while shooting "The Long Way Home".
