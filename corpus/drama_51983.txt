Three women from three different generations and walks of life find themselves in a very hot semi-deserted Spanish town. Patricia is a 17 year old roaming Spain in search for a certain man; Sol is 27 a door-to-door salesgirl in dire economic straits who has just been thrown out of her apartment; and Virginia is a middle aged housewife who after 20 years decides to start a new life. These three spend a very unique 24 hour period together often acting as the title suggests as modern day "witches."
