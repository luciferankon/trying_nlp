'Heidi Slater' a digital suicide-note or a twisted video Manifesto? I am Heidi Slater (pseudonym) and I present to you my film. 'Heidi Slater' is MY PERSONAL representation of the tragic events of the 18th of March 2013. I have edited together a collection of footage taken while (I thought) I was shooting a low budget Horror movie in fact 'The Director' was shooting something entirely different. I now face my fears and take back control by editing this film together for your consideration. Heidi Slater Eleven! 'Heidi Slater paints a dark canvas on which is played a terrifying battle of wits between the ultimate sadistic Director and his leading lady' - J.P. Bankes-Mercer (Writer/Director)
