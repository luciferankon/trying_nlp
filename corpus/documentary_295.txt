Jewish American Soldiers: Stories from WWII tells the stories of 12 Jewish American veterans from the Charlotte NC area. They were fighting a war on three fronts: against the Nazis against the Japanese and against anti-Semitism in their own ranks by their fellow troops. The lion's share of these "Greatest Generation" veterans are from outside the area but their WWII experience gave them the courage and opened them up to move to a "foreign" land: the South.
