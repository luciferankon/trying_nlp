According to legend God gave Vincente Ferrer patron saint of Juchitan a bagful of queers and everywhere he travelled he left behind a homosexual. But when he reached Juchitan Vincente's bag came undone spilling all the homosexuals out in the town. This is the story of a town in Mexico that has a very different attitude toward homosexuality than any of the areas surrounding it.
