When two naive Mormon missionaries Elder Talbot and Elder Johnson run into a restroom at a remote rest stop Justin steals their car.

As the two renegades find themselves embraced by the town's hospitality they try to map out their escape. With Elder Talbot and Elder Johnson destined to arrive what will happen when the town of New Harmony discovers that their missionaries are actually on the lam from the law?
