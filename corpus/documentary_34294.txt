In China every year millions of youth leave their small villages for greater opportunities in the city. Yet despite quickly adopting to life in the big city many still obey the strict customs that govern the small villages they grew up in especially when it comes to marriage. Chun who's been living in the Southern Chinese Metropolis of Guangzhou has finally succumbed to the ancient tradition of blind dating - a process in which you're given 15 minutes to choose a husband or wife - and is just weeks away from her wedding. Contrasting China's urban and rural settings the film follows her as she prepares to say goodbye to her life in the city and return home for a wedding she does not want to have.
