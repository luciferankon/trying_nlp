Spencer Maxson is a hard-headed agent who never sleeps. His wife Jade is a struggling actress that is trying to be a good spouse and raise their child. Beau Maxson is Spencer's younger estranged brother who deals with his problems through incessant drug use. Charlotte is a green eyed stripper with her head in the clouds. She gets involved and the story begins. We begin along Sunset Boulevard at The Roxy the glamorous yet gritty rock club. A legend. Now an icon. STORY proceeds to follow five distinctly different Hollywood personalities in a dark passionate and often brutal narrative. As the strangers interact with each other whether through chance meeting or complicated past it becomes obvious they share a realm of resemblance through addiction eroticism betrayal thirst for success inability to love and their own insecurities with who they are. Each of the five characters connect with one another through a mosaic of coincidence chance and past history. As these strangers do so it becomes obvious these five different and extreme persona's - the successful but forlorn television figure the junkie front man the love craved exotic dancer the struggling actress and the cold talking business suit - find a common trait in pursuing their own vision of happiness. But each falls short of achieving such as they plunge further into delusion and desperation.
