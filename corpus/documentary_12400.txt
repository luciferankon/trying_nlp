Shot over a week in the French ski resort Les Arcs Ride & Fly introduces us to a group of three speed-riders (François Bon Jérôme Baud and Maxence Cavalade) and their adventures combining off-piste skiing and paragliding. It's a week full of high-altitude rides evenings relaxing with friends and testing their skills against other extreme athletes such as Fred Fugen and Vincent Reffet also both speed-riders and Thibaud Duchosal a professional off-piste skier. Thibaud never uses a parachute so Jérôme and François decide to design a system to take him up in the air with them and release him over previously inaccessible slopes.
