Scott the founder of the Chautauqua camp. Early history includes when the canyon was a meeting place for neighboring Native American tribes. In addition to being the location of Scott's independent Chautauqua the town of Pacific Palisades was founded there in 1922. The area became a public park in 1994 thanks to the state's Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.
