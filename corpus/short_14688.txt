Shot in rural North & South Carolina this visually striking Bergman-esque portrait of a doomed love affair unfolds in a universe dominated by psychic violence. A man and a woman try to heal the rift in their relationship over the course of a long drought-plagued summer but their own private demons overwhelm them.
