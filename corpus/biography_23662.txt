The enigmatic life of electrical genius and visionary Nikola Tesla unravels through a posthumous F.B.I. investigation into his particle beam research including a new super weapon called a "death ray". During the height of World War II the F.B.I. races to secure the papers and experiments of an enigmatic recently deceased scientist who shortly before his death claimed to perfect a new super-weapon... a particle beam that could destroy ten thousand planes from 250 miles away... an invention referred to as the "death ray". Did the machine exist? Was it a threat to the war effort? Or was the radical inventor mad? It sounds like science fiction but it is true. In the screenplay Fragments From Olympus federal authorities race for an answer as they probe the life of genius inventor Nikola Tesla. Based on recently declassified documents and the amazingly triumphant and tragic life of Nikola Tesla Fragments From Olympus is two suspenseful stories intertwined which shed light on one of the world's most forgotten heroes. One of its goals is to bring the achievements of Nikola Tesla to public attention to help restore the credit that history has mistakenly placed elsewhere. Fragments From Olympus is a story of modern day martyrdom... of ideals and ironies... and how a cruel and apathetic world will sometimes crush the hero trying to save it.
