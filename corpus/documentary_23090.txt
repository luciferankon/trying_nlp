Most have never spoken publicly about the loss the guilt the immense pressure of feeling "spared." Who after all could ever truly understand? The answer is only each other. Sole Survivor brings four of them together (George Lamson Cecilia Cichan Bahia Bakari and Jim Polehinke) to share their very complex personal stories for the first time. They revisit the most harrowing moments of their lives in an effort to heal and overcome their most perplexing questions.
