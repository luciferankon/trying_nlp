They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. Zuo Zaijun ('Hawick Hau-Wai Lau' (qv)) Zheng Lei ('Yi-zhou Sun' (qv)) and Ning Xiaomeng ('Coulee Nazha' (qv)) were good friends in college. In fact both Zaijun and Lei were in love with Xiaomeng. But Xiaomeng left for the United States to further her studies and Zai Jun and Lei lost touch with her for eight years. During that time the men raised Xiaomeng's daughter Miaomiao whom Xiaomeng left behind.
