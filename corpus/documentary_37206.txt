Andersen himself a master raconteur is mostly good tempered and concedes to talking intimately about his experience of being the "Bad Boy" of Catholic Vienna in the 80s and his consequent experience in Berlin. He talks in detail about his relationship with his actors and the difficult and painful aspects of film making as well as the fun and absurdities. The film has several layers of reality to the point where the viewer must use his or her imagination to decide what is real and what is fiction-as scenes from Andersen's work are interwoven with the narrative-including the film maker's somewhat self-inflicted demise.
