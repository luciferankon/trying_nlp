A curtain opens and Will Rogers volunteers to guide us through Europe. First stop: Ireland. At Dublin's capitol buildings Rogers chats with President Cosgrave and Vice President O'Higgins. Rogers points out a memorial to Griffith and Collins dead in 1922. We see double-decker street cars and Trinity College. He pokes fun at Gaelic street names; we meet a Jew from County Kildare visit the civil-war-damaged Four Courts building and repair to a saloon. Rogers takes a ride in a horse-drawn jaunting car to the Guinness brewery. We see cattle and herds of sheep on the streets and a fishmonger with her wares in a baby buggy. Then it's to Phoenix Park to see the Free State's army.
