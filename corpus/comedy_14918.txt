A strange clause in an ancestral will said that if Laddubabu got married his father would inherit a lot of property. But a mosquito laden with a strange virus bites Laddubabu and he becomes humongously fat much to the disdain of his father who wanted to get him married very fast. Laddubabu meanwhile had other plans. He was in no rush. He wanted to find true love first. He wanted to find a girl who would love him and accept his enormous self for what it was. Fate intervenes in the form of a little kid whom Laddubabu makes enemies with. The little kid turns out to be a nemesis for Laddubabu's attempts at wooing his lady love. What look like chidish pranks initially turn out to be a well thought out strategy by the kid who wanted Laddubabu to abandon what he was doing and do what the kid wanted him to do. A thin man due to a stroke of fate becomes morbidly obese. But that doesn't prevent him from wanting to find true love in the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. What he didn't know was that another stroke of fate was waiting around the corner to strike him with something more unexpected.
