A Night To Remember is the recording of the concert held on November 17th 2015 at "Teatro Calderón" in Madrid. In a big production effort everything was set to capture what would happen in the almost three hours that followed after the lights were turned down. The house was crowded all the instruments miked and the 15 video cameras already recording when these 17 musicians handpicked for the occasion by Jorge Pérez walked on stage. Nobody knew not even them that what was planned to be a great concert turned out to be much more than that. What happened there was simply... A night to remember. The set list played in the show compiled by some of PATAX's most popular Michael Jackson arrangements plus some completely new covers and some original music defines the more than 2 hour-long content of this Blu-ray disc. PATAX directly from the concert to the mixing board and to your ears. You can't get any fresher than that.
