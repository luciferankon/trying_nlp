In this final programme of the series Richard Rudgley meets Neanderthal Man - our supposedly stupid cousin who became extinct 30000 years ago. Richard travels to Israel where early moderns and Neanderthals coincided for tens of thousands of years. And he visits Portugal where the skeleton of a child caused an international outcry when it was suggested he might be the hybrid offspring of Neanderthal and modern interbreeding.
