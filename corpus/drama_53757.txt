Based on a true story Braids tells the tale of So'ad a fourteen-year-old Jewish girl imprisoned by the Iraqi government in 1947 for her participation in the Zionist movement. The film illuminates a complex and sensitive period of Jewish life in Iraq when Jews felt their security threatened as anti-semitism surfaced with the growth of Zionism. Jailed for three years So'ad joined other political prisoners in a campaign of disobedience until Iraq opened its gates in 1950 and allowed Jews to emigrate to Israel. This feature film holds strong appeal for those interested in Sephardic culture.
