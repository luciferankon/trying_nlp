The Blind Stigma is a documentary that discusses mental health within the Black community. It chronicles and testifies the stories of five individuals on their trials and triumphs with mental health. Each story is told bravely and effectively with additional context provided by mental health professionals religious leaders caregivers and your everyday citizen. Within the Black community mental health is deemed as a 'Swept Under The Rug' stigma that has been creating false illusions and assumptions for a long time. That stigma is the core component of the African Canadian response to mental illness and therefore African Canadians who suffer from mental illness are less likely to seek treatment. As a result very few studies have been done on the impact of mental illness in the Black community. The Blind Stigma powerfully removes the veil of shame that clouds the topic of mental illness in the Black community challenge that misconception give a voice to Black Canadians living with mental illness and leaves the audience more informed and empowered.
