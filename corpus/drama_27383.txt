A young square-built Tadeás Falk called Táda ('Vladimír Kratina' (qv)) distributes meat from a slaughterhouse to the Liberec-city environs and to mountain hotels. The divorced Bára Saklová ('Zora Kerova' (qv)) must marry her lover Táda as soon as possible to get a company flat and be able to take care of her five-year-old daughter Beruska who lives with her grandmother. Her ex-husband a hotel manager Sakl ('Jirí Stepnicka' (qv)) troubles her. Though in fact he does not actually care for his daughter he does not agree Tadeás would adopt her and give her his name.
