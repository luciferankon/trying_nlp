Ghost Bird is a non-fiction feature about a small town in Arkansas an extinct giant woodpecker and everybody looking for the Holy Grail of birding - the Ivory-billed woodpecker. Following numerous sightings and its widely announced rediscovery in 2005  the world's best birders have been unable to locate even one "Lord God Bird" after over three years of intensive searching. Ghost Bird examines the meaning of hope faith and the limits of certainty in the quest to resurrect this lost species...unless like the Holy Grail itself the Ivory-bill remains forever out of reach. Ghost bird is a nice chronology of the "sightings" of the Ivory bill and the response the birding world and local area has seen. Very strong eye witness testimony but nothing else to support the sightings such as nests scaling (feeding) sights or vocalizations save for one vague recording that can be explained by other sounds. The most disturbing thing this documentary fails to address is what would be a viable breeding population for this bird to endure? Assuming that the first sighting was genuine this bird absent a breeding population is now almost certainly extinct. Interesting and provocative but wholly unproven as to the actual existence of this bird. FYI this bird is high on the list for genetic resurrection. Hundreds of collection specimens of this bird exist; but does any viable DNA??
