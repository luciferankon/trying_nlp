An old scientist who is tired after a long and strenuous day of research falls asleep in his studio. Soon his little grandson sneaks in and being an inquisitive little busybody the young rascal proceeds to investigate everything in the place and through his peering into some things which are supposed to be secrets we have an opportunity of enjoying a little peek also for everything that he sees through the magnifying glass is transmitted for our benefit upon the screen. In the first place he goes up to the telescope and gets a good view of all the heavenly bodies then turning the telescope earthward he views a lot of very amusing incidents far out of his reach. Finally coming into the studio he takes a piece of cheese and through the aid of the magnifying glass he shows the cheese lovers the good qualities of the delicious stuff as also does he magnify a drop of water and many other things of interest which if viewed at a proper time will be the cause of many swearing off for life.
