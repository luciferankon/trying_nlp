Skiiing for the Entire Family. Filmed at Holiday Hill in Wrightwood CA each week a new technique would be shot as the slops became more and more difficult. The series started with the Bunny Slope and taught the Snow Plow position and eventually finished with one of the most advanced slopes and slalom racing. One episode aired every week to help promote California skiing facilities and to educate viewers on the fun of skiing as a family.
