Dr. Robert Richardson a dedicated young general practitioner seeks to establish himself in an isolated fishing village on Cape Breton Island off the Nova Scotia coast. The population is poor and the struggling physician generally gets paid for his efforts in barter. When he meets Belinda McDonald a young deaf mute callously dismissed by family and neighbors as "the dummy" he alone senses her innate intelligence. He overcomes the initial skepticism of her flinty gruff father and indifferently cold aunt who operate a hardscrabble grist mill and farm and devotes himself to teaching the young girl sign language and lip-reading. Hopes are even raised that she might even eventually qualify for a medical procedure that might improve her condition. Her optimism is crushed however when she raped by Locky McCormick a brutish local fisherman. Traumatized she is unable to communicate the outrage to her family who are baffled and angry when they learn she is pregnant. The local gossips blame the doctor and he and the McDonalds become pariahs unable to earn a living in the provincial village. Matters come to a head when McCormick and his new wife pressure the local council to declare Belinda an unfit mother and declare them the baby's legal guardians.

He teaches her sign language and lip reading and she soon falls in love with him. When Belinda is left alone one night she is raped by the town bully Locky MacCormick. When Robert takes her to see a doctor it is discovered she is pregnant...
