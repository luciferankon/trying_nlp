An opportunistic Kyivan Apollon Shmyguyev whose peaceful bourgeois life is interrupted by the civil war decides to wait out the trouble in the South of Ukraine which is under the rule of the Russian White Army. After gathering left off goods on Andriyivskyi descent in Kyiv he goes on a journey with a camel which somehow had strayed to his house. In the midway he is stopped by the Red Army: the camel gets confiscated for the needs of revolution and Apollon appears in the disposal of the Bolshevik commissar. Zealous and cunning Apollon quickly takes lead of the local commissariat. But the ingrained thirst for a profit once again puts his life in danger.
