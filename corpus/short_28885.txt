For just one week of the year nearly 50000 individuals make the pilgrimage to the desolate Black Rock Desert in Northwestern Nevada to participate in the Burning Man Project a festival that provides space for unbridled creative expression. Through the interwoven stories of five men this short documentary reveals how experimentation with dress and bodily modification at the festal gathering may facilitate re-conceptualizations of masculine appearance style in more plural or open-ended terms. The act of styling and experimenting with the body becomes a way of thinking through and performing cultural anxieties about identity and gender in particular.
