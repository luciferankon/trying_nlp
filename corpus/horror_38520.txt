On his way to California Jodie decides on a whim to make a brief side trip to a farm where he meets and falls in love with Melissa the proverbial farmer's daughter. Or so it seems. In between the overlong dramatic pauses we learn that Melissa is in fact a 120-year-old witch and her remarkably spry "great-grandmother" Lucinda is actually her sister who has been pitchforking people to death in her spare time. When Lucinda murders a local policeman things start to get real complicated for Jodie.
