Patrick Miller had always hated Jaylen yet they were friends from grade school. But Jaylen took to the streets and lives the gang life so their friendship became a source of sadness. He was a rude with chubby hands and sloppy lips and always hanging under his gang brothers acting as if the gang life was the best life to live. His friends saw him as a flaky friend. Patrick walked over to Jaylen and reflected on their growing up and surroundings. The sun shone like a heated oven. The next day while walking home from school Patrick saw something in the distance or rather someone. It was the figure of Jaylen. Jaylen was a thoughtless friend with chubby hands and dreaded hair. Patrick gulped. He was not prepared for Jaylen. As Patrick stepped closer to Jaylen he could see the villainous glint in his eye. "I am here because I want to get him to join our street gang" Jaylen bellowed in a spiteful tone. He leaned closer towards Patrick's chest. "You should join our gang and make some of this money" no man I don't want too Patrick Miller." Patrick looked back walking off towards home as Jaylen and his gang brothers continued to hug the Fence. "Patrick join us now and forget your sports dreams and make this money" Jaylen screamed. They looked at each other with shocked feelings as both gasped and looked at each other. "I'm sorry but I can't join the street gang" he explained in pitying tones. Jaylen looked irritable as Patrick hurried away into the distance. Nothing is going to stop Jalen from living his dreams months later he realized his dream but the memories of his faded friend Jaylen (RIP) to violence.
