Sanna Sohlman is a singer with her own TV show. Her husband Lasse is an airline pilot and they have two children Flisan and Alex. Lasse is usually confused by jet-lag. Sanna's a pianist Melin is a "sober alcoholic" and the rest of the show crew are also a bit odd in their own ways: Kjell is homosexual Kemal has linguistic problems Max is over-ambitious and Malin's only advantage (next to being the object of Max' courtship) is that she is the daughter of the big boss.
