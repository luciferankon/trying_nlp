Each week host chef James Martin and his two invited TV chef colleagues each cook meals for the celebrity guest and the two winners of the weekly competition. Regular features include archive footage from various other TV chef shows and the omelette challenge where the two invited chefs must cook an omelette as fast as possible. Finally there is the Heaven and Hell test which requires the celebrity guest to name their most and least favourite foods. Viewers then vote for one of these foods and at the end of the show James Martin cooks a meal for the celebrity using the winning food item!
