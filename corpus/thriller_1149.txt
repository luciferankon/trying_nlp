During one of their regular breakfast meetings - and after 50 years of marriage - the wife surprisingly demands a divorce. Even though they have not been living together for 24 years she declares that 'she wants to be free when she dies'. As a consequence memories dark secrets and seemingly dormant emotions are aroused. Our bodies age; but love does not. "An Afternoon Encounter" is an adaptation of a play by Internationally-acclaimed author Henning Mankell.
