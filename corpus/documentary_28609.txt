Kristian (Mugge) Casper (SÅ™gaard) and Jakob (Nasser) are friends and neighbours and share a friendship based on humour and irony and as all other young men they all take a great interest in film sports girls sex and partying. They also share however some seriously challenging living terms; all three of them suffer from Progressive Muscular Dystrophy and thus - with a pinch of characteristic black humour - refer to themselves as the "Skin and Bones" guys. They live their lives strapped to wheelchairs on which various devices and equipment are attached which enable them some mobility and constantly blow essential air into their fragile bodies. They are surrounded 24-7 by professional helping and caring hands to help them pee shit eat and dress; but it's impossible for them to enjoy any form of private life so for obvious reasons it's difficult bordering on impossible for them to find love - and sex. Nevertheless they all three share an amazingly great zest for life. Being bent on living to the full - however short their lives may be - they also exhibit much more serenity on the issue of death than so many others. The Danish film director Michael Staal Dinesen has followed the three guys during four years and his film is an honest and boundless account of the challenges that the three men are facing. But also a wonderful and heart-warming celebration of life against all odds.
