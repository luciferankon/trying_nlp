Like a lot of her family before her Norma Rae works at the local textile mill where the pay is hardly commensurate with the long hours and lousy working conditions. But after hearing a rousing speech by labor activist Reuben Norma is inspired to rally her fellow workers behind the cause of unionism. Her decision rankles her family especially her fianc√© Sonny and provokes no shortage of contempt from her employers. Norma Rae is a southern textile worker employed in a factory with intolerable working conditions. This concern about the situation gives her the gumption to be the key associate to a visiting labor union organizer. Together they undertake the difficult and possibly dangerous struggle to unionize her factory. Norma Rae is a lively but dependable wife and mother in an Alabama mill town. Like her father her mother and most of her friends she works at the Henley mill spinning and weaving cloth as the days go by without much apparent purpose. Her "nothing special" life changes when she and her coworkers meet Reuben a dedicated smart-mouthed labor organizer down from New York to teach the Henley crew about solidarity in a place where workers and owners alike think "union" and "trouble" are synonymous.
