Working long hours in the same place with just one other person to talk to all of the conversations you want to have and feel as though you should be having just don't seem to happen. This is a conversation but an unusual one... A cocky security guard who likes to question and laugh at the small things in life and a long suffering receptionist who yearns for a normal conversation but never quite gets it... Taking in everything from dairy farming to relationships this is a conversation you'll never want to have on your tea break!
