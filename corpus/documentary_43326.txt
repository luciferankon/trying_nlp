This is the incredible true story of tiny conjoined twins Trishna and Krishna abandoned just after birth at an orphanage in Bangladesh. They were joined at the back of the head and shared blood vessels between their brains. The desperately ill girls were found by an aid worker and rushed to Australia by the Children First Foundation. The twins were stabilised at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital before the decision was made to attempt the separation. The separation was done progressively over two years culminating in a massive 32 hour surgical procedure. It attracted international attention as the world's media followed this gripping story waiting for news that the twins had survived. This documentary also features the remarkable team of neurosurgeons anaesthetists (anaesthesiologists) cardiologists and plastic surgeons who painstakingly planned and performed the marathon surgery.
