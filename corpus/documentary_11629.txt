'Schtick Happens' documents the conflict between documentary filmmakers and their subject after the release of the film 'Original Schtick'. It's a story that challenges notions of representation as it traces subject Bob Fischer's unfolding story his shifting reactions to the film the tenuousness of his involvement with the documentary filmmakers as well as their joint attempts to sell and promote 'Original Schtick'. This film is about making it happen capitalising on fame while also recognising that 'schtick' can pass in a fleeting moment. And what you have left is the difference between art and artfulness.
