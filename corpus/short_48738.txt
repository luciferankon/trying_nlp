Nikita Kleverov takes us on a journey deep into the constructs of the minds of normal people. Once inside we discover that nothing we once knew as fact can be used as evidence for the justification of mankind. It is a short surrealistic piece split up into eleven segments in order to concentrate the viewer on the intense imagery and content. Although not following a concrete linear structure this is one of the most intriguing self-reflective films of our time. From a man that reluctantly feeds his buried past to an incredulous structure placed amongst nothingness to a humble blind couple that come to discover death on their own terms Windless is an experiment in closed form filmmaking of our postmodern age.
