Two brothers escape to a tree fort to break away from their father's post-Vietnam trauma. Inspired by "The Adventure's of Huckleberry Finn" they build a raft to sail down the river in hopes of finding their life's purpose in a better world. The Fort reveals the truth about how the mental wounds of war can affect an entire family and the courage it takes to break the generational cycle of violence.
