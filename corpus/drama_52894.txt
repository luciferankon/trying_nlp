Bong-yong Kim is one of a modest Korean dad who struggles to survive from the work place without any time to get along with his family. He has to work over than he had to since the boss treat him like his servant - drink late every night drive the boss to his home. His wife Hwayeon blames him for his indifference to family and twins in puberty Woo-joo and Dal-nim also in trouble with their father. The late child 'Byeol-nim' is his only one who acts charm and shows cuteness to him.. MY LAST LOVE when every family member starts to share with caring each other at last.
