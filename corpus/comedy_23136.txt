Pat and Molly Malloy once famed vaudeville and Broadway performers arrive to play the small town of Hamilton Conn. with a troupe of dancers singers a trained dog and an educated seal. Harry Clark the clerk at the rundown Swanzey Hotel insults Pat and the latter uses the $4000 that he and Molly have been saving for years to buy a retirement farm to buy the hotel so he can fire Harry. Local skinflint J.A. Higgins wants the hotel as he knows the state has intentions to buy it for a museum but Pat won't sell. Higgins puts an ad in "Variety" and a swarm of jobless vaudevillians headed by Marvello descend to take advantage of the "free board" mentioned in the ad and soon turn it into a three-ring circus. The only paying customer Iradius P. Oglethorpe informs Pat that the old chairs stored in the cellar are priceless antiques. Based on that Pat refuses Higgins' second-and-higher offer but soon learns that Oglethorpe is the village idiot and the chairs are worthless. Their last hope is a benefit show staged by Higgins' nephew Chuck Bradford who loves Jeanne Carlyle of the Malloy troupe. But the free-loading vaudeville boarders skip town.
