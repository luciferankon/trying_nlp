Black Biscuit is a film that follows the life and times of today's misfits and rascals. A spiritual journey into societies myths. Chet is a freewheeling life model who begins working as a male escort in order to bring in some extra cash as he concentrates on realizing his true dream of becoming a filmmaker. But his discipline and outlook on life begin to change due to the new influences of his lifestyle and the rewards and comforts of dirty money. He must face the question of choosing his destiny. Black Biscuit was created under the PINK8 manifesto - a new maverick way of creating raw poetic un-polished Punk Cinema. Shot on mobile phones and childrens cameras and featuring an array of street superstars (homeless people prostitutes handicapped folk and an ex child ping pong champion). The spirit of a generation gap has been defined like lightning in a bottle. Cinema will never be the same again.
