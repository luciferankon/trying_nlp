A young female doctor leaves her job at a clinic as she wants to work as a "land√§rtztin" in a small town. The local people are up for a surprise as the mayor thought the were getting Dr. Peter Jensen not Petra. Most of the locals can not yet accept a female doctor. The backward people start a boycott but the priest of the town has some ideas to make the them trust the doctor. The local veterinary is also standing on the doctor's side and not only because of her competence. Finally the doctor has to take care of the mayor's daughter giving birth. It's a matter of life and death but the fate of the doctor is also in the game.
