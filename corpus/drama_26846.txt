Foster Borrum is the wealthiest man in the town of Norwalk. He practically owns everything. He has won his position by merciless grinding and is regarded by the villagers with fear and contempt. A stern man with only one softening influence in his life his wife whom he idolizes. The wife dies and Borrum turns on the world with added bitterness and hatred. He is living a life of dreary isolation when one day a visitor steps off the train at the station a little girl; also alone in the world; who has been tagged to her destination in the search of a relative who has long since disappeared. The villagers are too poor to adopt the child. In a cynical mood Borrum takes possession of the girl. Ivy Marten and installs her in his home. Ivy aching for sympathy meets with no response from the austere man whose treatment of her borders on brutality. Exaggerated reports of this reach the authorities and Borrum is haled before them. Ivy who loves the old man in spite of his coldness is the prime witness for the defense and her loyal support of her guardian wins the day. A change comes over the attitude of Borrum towards the child and the world in general and with a softened heart he strives to make life happier for the orphan and for the hitherto despised inhabitants of the poverty stricken village.
