'El Mole y El Mezcal' was an idea born from repeated conversations between the filmmakers about the wonders of food and its cultural diversity. Combined with the fact that the actor/producer is from Mexico one thing led to another and one night they found themselves together armed with some chicken mole sauce a bottle of Mezcal and a camera. What emerged was a sort of gastronomic poem about friendship.
