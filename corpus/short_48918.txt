The world has been taken over by The Unknown. No one knows who they are or why it was done only that a new set of rules are in force. All humans are controlled and held to a strict regiment forbidding contact with one another. One man attempts to break this routine for love. What happens when this control is threatened is as mysterious as The Unknown.
