A mockumentary about a group of documentray filmmakers trying to make a documentary about themselves trying to make the documentary that they are trying to make. An over-the-top comedy in which an egotistical director and his concept-stunned crew somehow make their way through the production process on a set that is truly a "worst case scenario". Obviously the best film ever made.
