In 1997 the Spa Creek bridge in Annapolis MD was shut down for repairs. This was the main connection to the city for the neighborhood of Eastport. Residents worried that this would negatively effect their local economy and businesses. In response a group formed to found the 'Maritime Republic of Eastport'. They 'officially' seceded from Annapolis and the U.S and can be found in the book of micro nations. In 1998 the MRE held a tug of war across Spa Creek to pit Eastport versus Annapolis. This is purportedly the largest tug of war across a body of water in the world although the Guinness Book of World Records doesn't recognize tug of wars due to their danger. Slaughter Across The Water picks up during the 12th annual tug of war. Founding members residents and visitors tell the people's history of the MRE and the tug. Embedded coverage of 'patriotic' events include the annual Declaration of War march on City Hall Black Ops and the tug of war itself. Slaughter Across The Water tells the story of the people of the MRE who are 'still revolting' 12 years after their founding.
