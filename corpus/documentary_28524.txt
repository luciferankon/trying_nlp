Immigrants from the poor parts of the world camp out at the Hungarian-Serbian border on the outskirts of the EU. In the Hungarian town of RÃ¶szke illegal newcomers are caught by patrols made of local volunteers. At the same time in Subotica which is on the other side of the border the local minister also gets on with his job. He helps immigrants overcome the difficulties of their journey and get through to their "promised land."
