Civil disobedience is not our problem. Our problem is civil obedience. Our problem is that people all over the world have followed the dictates of leaders and millions have been murder because of this obedience. Our problem is that people are obedient all over the world in the face of poverty and starvation and stupidity and war and cruelty. Our problem is that people are obedient while the jails are full of petty thieves and the grand thieves are running the country. That's our problem.
