This biographical picture that was made for the 200th anniversary of Nikolai Gogolis filmed in the unique style of the author Leonid Parfyonov. Documentary shows that the author of "Dead Souls" "The Inspector General" and "Taras Bulba" is not the founder of realism in Russian literature but a modern and actual avant-garde writer who created works hitherto unprecedented full of magic and phantasmagoria.
