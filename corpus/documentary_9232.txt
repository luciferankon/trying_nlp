As a young father watching his daughter go through her life experiences film director Alexandre Mourot discovered the Montessori approach and decided to set his camera up in a children's house (3 to 6 years of age) in the oldest Montessori school in France. Alexandre was warmly welcomed in a surprisingly calm and peaceful environment filled with flowers fruits and Montessori materials. He met happy children who were free to move about working alone or in small groups. The teacher remained very discreet. Some children were reading others were making bread doing division laughing or sleeping. The children guided the film director throughout the whole school year helping him to understand the magic of their autonomy and self-esteem - the seeds of a new society of peace and freedom which Maria Montessori dedicated her life work to.
