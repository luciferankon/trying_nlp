The earthquake that struck Haiti in January of 2010 brought tragedy to an island that has seen more than its share of sorrow. Within days the worldwide media descended on the island and just as quickly departed as other stories were deemed more important. CBS journalists correspondent Bill Whitaker and producer Erin Lyle George had the fortune to remain in Haiti for a month witnessing more than any other American network journalists. The film chronicles what they experienced and despite all of the heartache and misery there is still reason to hope.
