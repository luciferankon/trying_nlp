Eva falls in the water but Pavel saves her. One of the tourists relates the similar legend: Iva the Nymph throws herself in the sea from a high cliff. Angler Pavel saves her. She kisses him. This is believed to be curse. Pavel enters the monastery as a novice and avoids meeting her. After a long absence Grigor returns to the small town. Grigor falls for Iva and proposes to her. However Iva loves Pavel. Every night she swims to the monastery's island to see her lover. Seized with jealousy Grigor kills Pavel and puts his corpse in the boat. Iva swims after the boat. Far out at the sea she catches it. Grigor throws Pavel's body into water. Iva embraces him and together they vanish into the sea. Grigor loses his mind and disappears in the darkness... The listeners of the legend disperse over the island in silence. A couple of shots are heard and all gather again. Grigor has been shooting at ducks but has missed. In his words "a man of fifty" is not old but his hand is not as steady as use to be. Eva and Pavel embrace.
