Ocean explorer Jean-Michel Cousteau filmmaker Jim Knowlton and a team of scientists explore tiny Swains Island located 200 miles north of American Samoa and reachable only by boat. They camp on shore to study this remote island that has recently been named a National Marine Sanctuary. Jean-Michel dives its pristine coral reefs that he says are as healthy as you can find. The scientists search for clues to the island's past use especially by early Polynesians that settled the island and used it as a stopover to reach distant Islands and also when it was used as a family-owned copra plantation. They uncover many mysteries long-held on this tiny island in this fascinating Jean-Michel Cousteau adventure.
