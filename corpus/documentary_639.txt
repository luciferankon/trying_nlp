Once upon a time in Russia communism fell and Rock 'n' Roll rose to power. One band reigned supreme and toured far and wide across the eastern earth but never even left Russia - until now. They only have once chance to not only rule Russia -but to become the best band in the West. The strategy is simple - get on the boat create an album - and make new friends. All with hopes of finally becoming a household name in the United States. But sometimes fame is harder than just toppling a government.
