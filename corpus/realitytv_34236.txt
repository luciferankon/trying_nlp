Niels arrives on the same steamboat that brought the saint from Spain then joins the waiting families crowd. The mayor personally presides over a warm welcome culminating in the balcony announcement of bad Flemish kids- actually none at second sight. Interviews and flashbacks elaborate the boat trip and preparations. A new character is the weatherman.
