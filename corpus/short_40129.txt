Ciao Vettor is a tribute to the artist Vettor Pisani who committed suicide in the summer 2011. The film underlines the extraordinary importance which covers the interior world of every artist. The phrase "Du bist Deine Welt" (engl.: "You are your world") points out precisely: What the artist has seen what the artist has lived becomes his world and that what remains even after him. Vettor Pisani continues to exist in his works in his ideas and in the affections of those who had known him. And then basically it was Vettor - borrowing himself the words of Wittgenstein - saying: "What can be said at all can be said clearly; and about that of which one cannot speak one must stay silent."
