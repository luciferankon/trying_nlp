Naranappa a man born in the community of Madhwa (A community of Brahmins from Karnataka) is dead in the Agrahara of the village Durvasapura. As per the Madhwa customs the last rites of the dead man has to be performed at the earliest. But Naranappa was a rebel who fought against Brahminism who ate meat consumed liquor and also married a Dasi (a prostitute). Since he doesn't have any family there is some confusion as to who will do the last rites and fire the funeral pyre. Praneshacharya the head of the Agrahara a devout and learned Brahmin is tasked with providing the solution.
