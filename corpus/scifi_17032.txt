New World Order dream and brain explorations lead us into a psychical maze of a scientific mansion. One normal night Jill gets an odd invitation to an exclusive event. She's used to invitations nothing new. She wakes up sweating and gasping for air at 3:19 a.m. to answer her door. She disregards the invitation. Days later Holly touches a piece of the invitation; on the back of the card where a thumb indention marks the spot she places her thumb on it. She instantaneously gets a rush of pure dopamine straight to her brain. She is orgasmically enlightened. She promptly follows the directions on the invite. Walk into a crazed poetic maze. New World Order evolutionists are covering up their tracks. Computer chips and illegal brain experiments are the norm. 'Nous Ordo Seclorum' "New World Order" Look at the back of the dollar bill.
