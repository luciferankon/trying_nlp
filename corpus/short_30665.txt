Nicky's mom put her in Girl Scouts and made her work hard. Her hard work and dedication allows her to reach all her goals. She loved being a Girl Scout so much that she passes the tradition down to her daughter Carrie. Behind every Girl Scout are always her best friends and the history of all the girls that came before her.
