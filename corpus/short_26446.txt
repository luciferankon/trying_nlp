After seeing the show Julie notices the book 'Le Petit Prince' and asks her mother to buy it for her. Since Francoise is too poor she tries to steal the book the next day. Unbeknownst to Francoise a constable has seen the entire act and takes her to jail. Alone Julie goes to the theater to learn to dance. Once released Francoise finds Julie with the vaudevillians at the theater were their lives are left changed.
