Erica Wexler's Facebook is a work of art. Every two minutes there's a fresh full-page influx of wall posts from her Facebook friends asking questions - about class presentations or whether they should get side-bangs or if they should hang out with this or that cute guy or girl from recitation. And Erica's great about responding she's better than most people who give it to the two-hour-wait-to-look-cool before writing a wall post back. She's decidedly on top of her Facebook stuff. But the thing is that Erica Wexler's dead.
