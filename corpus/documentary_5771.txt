This documentary on the making of GWTW focuses on the driving force behind the legendary film producer David O. Selznick. He purchased the rights and over several years tried to have a script developed. Several writers had their hand in the effort and in truth the script was never properly finalized something that dogged the film throughout its production. While the decision to cast Clark Gable as Rhett Butler was fairly straightforward finding the right actress to play Scarlett O'Hara captured national attention with several of Hollywood's top stars vying for the part. The original director George Cukor left before the films completion as did his replacement Victor Fleming. Selznick directed some of the scenes himself and was driven to get the film completed just as he wanted. From the film's initial test screening the film-going public adored the results.
