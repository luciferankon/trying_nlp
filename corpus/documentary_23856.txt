This short documentary explores the people music and community of Earthsong a 8 day retreat camp in Cahir Co. Tipperary with 500 participants. It is a public festival however some well held ground rules are kept to ensure a space where authentic personal development  safety for children and a strong community spirit can flourish. These include - absolutely no alcohol or drugs on site no visitors or late arrivals  no phones on site or loud noise after 11. The festival holds many classes and workshops throughout the week including meditation chanting 4 part harmony singing large drum circles dance groups and many personal development classes. The feel and joy of this week long retreat is hard to communicate in words. Great celebration friendship music fun and growth is experienced by all who embrace the festivals happenings. People camp in circles of 20 people for the week all of whom feel like family by the end. I believe this festival is very special. John Bowker the founder of the camp is a master drummer and is considered 'Ireland leading drum facilitator' Irish Times. John has created a retreat where great respect is given to the sacredness of music. and tradition. It is about feeling safe to be and express ourselves without our habitual masks. Expression through music and dance community living and support distance from our daily distractions and the absence of drugs and alcohol all aid in allowing this sense of freedom and safety to flourish.
