This game seems to have taken the country by storm and every child is more or less of a diabolo expert and for that reason this film should prove very popular with the rising generation. In the first picture we see the devils originating the game and forging and making the spool in the infernal regions. There is a transformation scene and we see a number of skeletons dancing around and all playing the game skillfully. They disappear and we behold numerous beautiful girls appearing and disappearing and all are dancing and spinning the spool in clever fashion. Next we are introduced to the royal family of Hades and the King and Queen seated on their throne are being amused by all their courtiers playing the game. Finally the old King becomes so interested that he and the Queen join in the revelry and soon the whole throng are whirling around in the flames and all busy playing. The last scene shows the heavens and a figure representing the sun playing and he passes it on to the moon who in turn passes it to the earth who takes it up with a will and is busy tossing the spool while the rest of the planets look on amused.
