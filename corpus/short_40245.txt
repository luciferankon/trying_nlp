When Fernando's father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer the 15-year-old came up with the idea to create a biological 3D printer to print organs. The task turned out to be more complicated than he thought but with the help of his uncle Neal Fernando was still able to build a 3D printer from scratch in just 7 months.
