Stuff Everywhere is a personal documentary about the connection between people and their stuff. Things are handy they make life easier and we think they will bring us joy. But they invade our houses the streets the sea and our minds. In how we think about ourselves about the economy and about cubicle space. Stuff Everywhere is a poetical film filled with questions numbers and searching words.
