The electric streetcar tram or trolley was a ride that changed everything. Across a century-and-a-half trolleys carried billions of people to work and play and home again; they helped relieve cities of mountains of horse manure and choking air pollution and they connected neighborhoods and enabled movement in dense urban corridors. Gifted with extreme efficiency and an egalitarian outlook the device helped revitalize and re-build the urban landscape. The Trolley that Saves the World follows this unique and evolving machine: from its perfection at the hands of a 19th century inventor and its explosive global adoption to its engagement in two world wars; from its devastating collision with the automobile age to its 21st century renaissance as a vital engine in the war against climate change.
