It is 1887 the old west in a small town. The Kane brothers (Gabe and Luke Kane) are the town sheriffs who work hard to keep the peace. Gabe falls in love with a girl (Ann Keegon) who goes against her father's orders to stay away from Gabe and the two plan to marry. Ann's father (Bill Keegon) is outraged and has Gabe beaten but Gabe and Ann will not let anything stand in their way. When Keegon's son kills a man during a hold up Gabe must choose between his duty and his feelings for Ann and he brings Ann's brother to jail for murder. This creates bad blood between the Kanes and Keegon owner of the Bar-K ranch. Keegon being a man who always gets what he wants even going outside the law to do it brings all his Bar-K gunmen in for the showdown. Gabe and Luke are now in a fight for justice and a fight that will test all they are made of. The Kane brothers and their father John walk alone in the street. The town is still. Three men step into the old corral to face the wrath of the Bar-K 21 men who are there for one reason only: to gun down the Kanes. They all stand quietly the wind blows slightly. For a moment all is silent as the wind stops and the last sound they might ever hear is the clicking of their guns.
