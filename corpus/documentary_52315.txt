A history and profile of the Olde Towne East neighborhood of Columbus Ohio situated east of Downtown. Throughout much of the 19th century Columbus' first "streetcar suburb" was home to many of the city's wealthiest and most influential residents who spared no expense to build the finest houses in the latest architectural styles. The neighborhood suffered decline in the mid-20th century as homeowners moved outward to the newer suburbs and two Interstate highways cut the neighborhood off from the rest of the city. But programs such as the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 have aided the rehabilitation of many of the grand old mansions and led to a revitalization of the multi-ethnic community.
