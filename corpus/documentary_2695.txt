Every year millions of people from all around the world come looking for a Paris that doesn't exist anymore. VOUS ETES ICI (You Are Here) is an exploration into the experiences of tourism in Paris pulling back the curtain to look at a Paris you don't see in postcards. What do we anticipate when we visit Paris and what do we actually experience? What is it like to try and make a living from tourists? VOUS ETES ICI brings together a wide range of experiences to look at Paris in a new way - as a dream destination and as an epicenter of mass tourism.
