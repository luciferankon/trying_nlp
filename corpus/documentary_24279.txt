The essence of the Zen Garden installation concept commissioned by Zazen Bear to be displayed prominently in their global flagship store in New York City is the Zen ideal of impermanence. The piece features world-renowned artist Jim Denevan raking patterns into a sand garden that are inspired both by the designs of traditional Japanese Zen gardens as well as the aesthetics of the Zazen Bear brand. Each pattern is only allowed to exist for a short time before it is routinely swept away to create a clean space for the next design. The entire process lasts approximately 2 hours but the piece is displayed in a seamless loop that runs throughout the day within the store thus maintaining a constant state of change.
