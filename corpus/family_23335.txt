Naughty Carlson and the gullible Kid are the heroes of the well-known fairy tale. Carlson is very fond of fooling and for all the consequences of antics he has a "proprietary" excuse: "Trivia it's something everyday!". True the parents of the Kid do not think so but all the same he does not have to miss his flying friend. Then climbing on the roofs friends prevent major theft (in the role of a crook - Andrei Mironov) then they together tame the evil housekeeper .
