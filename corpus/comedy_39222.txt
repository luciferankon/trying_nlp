The 007 program has been terminated. MI6 agent James Bawnd 00-O has been committed to a psychiatric facility in the Canadian countryside under the notion he is on a mission to track down a French Canadian Terrorist named Monay who is posing as a mine in downtown Montreal. Bawnd realizes he has been abandoned yet again by his own people and makes attempts to escape Kennedy Lodge only to have his attempts thwarted by the evil Nurse Ratched and her loyal minions who work there. The Next James Bawnd is a blend between the James Bond franchise and Milos Forman's classic film One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.
