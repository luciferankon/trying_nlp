Rebellion of Thought takes a critical look at the role of faith in a postmodern culture. What is the role of the church today? Does Man truly need God or is God merely a fairytale idea leftover from past cultural experiments? These questions are the launching point for this new film by The Brothers Williamson. What began as a documentary exploring postmodernism soon became a personal struggle. Along the journey the filmmakers learn that living one's faith out in the larger culture is very different than living one's faith within the walls of the traditional Church.
