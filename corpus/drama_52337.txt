This is a story of disease and suffering; of medication and adverse effects; of thoracotomy scars and cellular poisons; of the living who cannot help but to die and of the dying who cannot help but to live; of a resting place other than "on 7F" or "at home". This is a story of so many things. But most of all - this is the story of a girl whose heart was standing still and a boy whose breath was being stolen away both of whom die.
