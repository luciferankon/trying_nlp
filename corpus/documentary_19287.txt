Happy Berry is the name of a Bangkok boutique run by a group of trendy Thai youths and is the nerve centre of this fly-on-the-wall documentary (the second in a trilogy entitled "Life and Love"). The camera catches the subjects indulging in all the (post) modern lifestyle trends: drugs kinky sex hip-hop fashion exhibitionism narcissism. They are uninhibited the kind of youth who break down barriers in a supposedly traditional and religious society but perhaps that's just on the surface. Behind the upbeat tone is a probing examination of values and attitudes in modern youth relationships. Happiness may be deceptive but there's certainly a lot of fun in the Happy Berry.
