'... but don't call me a BASTARD' is a documentary film based on human rights violation and social injustice in 162 India-Bangladesh enclaves for more than 6 decades. And around 51000 enclave dwellers in both the country India and Bangladesh were struggling over their national identity crisis under the leadership of Diptiman Sengupta Asst. Secretary of Bharat-Bangladesh Enclave Exchange Co-ordination Committee and they also spread their problem with the help of local journalists from both the country. Though he is Indian Diptiman Sengupta was fighting for the rights of these enclave dwellers to fulfill his father's dream after his sudden demise in 2009 who was actually the founder of this organisation. And at last these deprived people got official freedom at midnight on 31st July in 2015 and the world will lose the concept of third-order enclave.
