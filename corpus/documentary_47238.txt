For more than six hundred years spanning two major civilizations and diverse political regimes the inhabitants of the territory which is today known as Mexico have held some type of election to appoint authorities. In the ancient Valley of Mexico the process was known as tlatoanis. During the colonial period town councils and representatives of corporations were chosen. In the nineteenth century electorates appointed representatives and from 1911 forward these electorates have chosen local state and federal authorities.
