'The battering hand' is a documentary about the domestic violence that women suffer in Spain and that each year reaps a larger number of victims. Through the direct testimonies of victims of home violence the documentary dramatically reviews some of the most recent cases and talks to judges and lawyers about the legal frame with which the European Union is trying to put an end to this problem. Unfortunately the conclusion is that there is still no definite answer to violence in the social politic and judiciary areas.
