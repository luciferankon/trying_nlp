Peter Berdon joins a group of Stalinists after his father is killed by the Nazis in this grim political drama. The film begins with his arrest and uses flashbacks to tell the events that led to his incarceration. His abuse is chronicled both in and out of prison after he falls in with a Bonnie and Clyde-like duo after the war is over.
