Piotr Tymochowicz media advisor to some of Poland's top politicians claims that anybody can be molded into a charismatic leader. To prove it he's looking for a greenhorn that can be turned into a candidate. A call is put out for would-be participants and hundreds apply. A small group is selected and under go training. Polish master Marcel Lozinksi followed Tymochowicz and this project for three years and this beautifully shot and edited work paints a compelling portrait of cynical (and quite familiar) demagogy and populism in action. Taken through exercises in all aspects of being a politician from body language to handling media scrums soon a candidate emerges. The relative ease with which the political rookie Dariusz merges into active political life is quite shocking as is his completely malleable ideology. "It's a revolution in communications" claims Tymochowicz.
