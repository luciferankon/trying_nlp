Daniela Katzenberger born in Ludwigshafen on October 10 1986. Occupation: Beautician. Vocation: TV-star. In early 2009 the German TV-nation could watch Daniela's struggle to get a job at the American restaurant chain "Hooters" - in vain. She was also rejected at Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion in L.A. But still she won over the hearts of the viewers with her directness her wit and her self-irony. Daniela's adventures become part of the series "Goodbye Deutschland". Starting from spring 2010 Daniela builds up her own "Café Katzenberger" on Mallorca. More than 2 million viewers followed the opening of the "most blonde café in the world" on July 13 2010 and "Goodbye Deutschland" reached a new market-share peak with 11.3 percent. Daniela's format started on VOX in fall 2010 - and the fourth season of "Daniela Katzenberger - natürlich blond" started in fall 2012.
