All's well until Elwood's social-climbing sister Veta and her teenage daughter Myrtle Mae come to live with him and fear his odd behavior will undermine their ambitions. When Elwood disrupts the ladies' first afternoon tea party by introducing wealthy Aunt Ethel Chauvenet to Harvey Veta sees that something must be done right away. She takes compliant Elwood to the Chumley Rest Home leaving him in the car while she tells a Dr. Sanderson all about Elwood and Harvey. Sanderson concludes that Veta is the psychotic one and has her carted off to be committed. Meanwhile Elwood is treated with respect and dignity in light of his sister's mental state. When Dr. Chumley head of the rest home returns and hears of the case he draws the opposite conclusion-that Elwood in fact hallucinates. After firing Sanderson for his misdiagnosis Dr. Chumley sets out in pursuit of Elwood completely forgetting poor Veta who is left to manage her own escape from confinement in the home!
