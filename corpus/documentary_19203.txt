The Battle of OP Harry Korea. The Story of Forgotten Soldiers in a Forgotten Battle of a Forgotten War. By the end of the Korean War the US 3rd Infantry Division had orders to hold OP Harry at all costs -- the Chinese intended to seize it. On 10 June 1953 3500 Chinese assaulted that position defended by King Company 15th Infantry Regiment -- of about 200 US soldiers. Massive artillery fire -- 90000 US and 30000 Chinese shells -- decimated both sides. K Company and then reinforcing units of about a hundred -- at terrible human cost -- ejected the attackers from the trenches in close combat with only about 20 US soldiers walking off the mountain unscathed the next morning. But the Chinese suffering 90% loses would return again and again for eight subsequent nights with more then 10000 troops no one knows for sure. The film depicts interviews with these aging American South Korean Greek and Chinese veterans -- in addition to introducing three Generals MASH nurses the South Korean Prime Minister noted scholars and political commentators Newt Gingrich US Sen. Richard Lugar US Con. Charles Rangel S. Korean Honorable Hwang US Historian Allan Millett Michael Slater and author Oliver North. By dedicating an entire program to the buildup battle and its aftermath while endearing the audience to these soldiers a unique perspective is given to the greater Korean War itself. These combatants -- who are so proud of their service -- are grateful that before their generation is gone a document is finally procured to preserve the memory of the soldiers who fell attacking and defending OP Harry to HOLD AT ALL COSTS. As the new world order was imminent the term "Hold At All Costs" is ultimately what the Korean War or Cold War was all about. It is hopeful that these stories represent all soldiers of that era and perhaps all soldiers everywhere throughout warfare. Narrated by Edward Herrmann.
