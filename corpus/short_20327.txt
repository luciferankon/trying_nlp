'We have no name strange woman' is a meditation on the shrinking boundaries between the urban and desert landscapes. Images of the Salton Sea a man-made "accident" and the largest (and only) saltwater lake in California are juxtaposed with abandoned motor homes and the desolate industrial districts of East Los Angeles giving rise to moments of both uncanny resemblance and striking divergence. An unexpected beauty emerges from the wasteland as the lake is currently the home to a number of endangered species who have been displaced from the wetlands of Southern California due to rapid over-development. 'We have no name strange woman' is a document of the persistence of life to thrive in and amongst the ruins of failed human developments.
