Col. Nelson is on a long-term top-secret space mission. Jeannie cannot bring him home (temporarily) to hear their son's important academic presentation without knowing exactly where he is in the first place. The general in charge of the mission won't reveal anything. Things are further complicated when Jeannie's sister (Jeannie II) reminds Sham-Ir the head of the genies that a genie on Earth cannot go more than 3 months without an earthly master. (Col. Nelson is no longer Earthly being in space.) Sham-Ir give Jeannie I a fortnight (14 days) to either find Col. Nelson or get a new master a single male. (Col. Healy can't help since he's now married.)
