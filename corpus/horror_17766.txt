An American girl Isabella sets out to make a documentary to understand what happened to her mother who murdered three clergy people. She was not convicted due to insanity and was sent to a mental hospital in Italy. Isabella meets with some priests in Italy who explain that her mother's condition may not be medical but could be an extra-human possession. This film is a 'Found Footage' style movie about a woman (Isabella) who travels to Italy to do a documentary about her mother who in 1989 supposedly killed three clergy who were performing an exorcism on her (the mother) at the time. When she gets there she meets two priests who also perform exorcisms on possessed people but normally without the permission of the Vatican. Isabella has a camera man with her (Michael) who films and documents everything. They soon find that Isabella's mother is still possessed but when they do the exorcism they realize that the demon (or demons) can jump from one person to another. But who becomes possessed next?
