A teacher in W. Covina California circa spring 1986 shows his student's a bit of film reel of the JFK Assassination. Later he has them play a game wherein each student is sorted into at least 5 groups of 4 students each. Each group representing a fictitious nation. Each unit has a "president" or other top leader. -- a banker overseeing. national finance a top military official and a state representative such as a Secretary of State. The purpose was to teach the difficulty and imperative necessity of diplomatic negotiations. Each group had to reach consensus before being able to negotiate with another group with a similarly United character. However only one member of each group was needed to launch nuclear weapons -- devastating all everywhere and of course. Ending the game.
