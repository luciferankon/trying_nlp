The crew at the Embassy Theaters multiplex isn't getting a lot of work done. Instead this group of teen slackers slobs and smart-asses spend their time pranking customers tormenting their brown-nosing supervisor inciting lobby riots and hooking up with the candystand girls. Multiplexing traces the outrageous antics of those minimum wage kids at the movie theater who spend their days and nights sweeping up your popcorn spills and selling $8 dollar boxes of Milk Duds. To host a big Hollywood premiere the rowdy teen staff at a multiplex must shape up and deal with their tyrannical boss a mysterious phantom the racist doorman a stiff in the men's room stampeding crowds a disgruntled employee gone postal and one very horny 300 pound cashier who won't take no for an answer.
