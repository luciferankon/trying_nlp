In there 2030 ain't much changed. Ain't no flying cars ain't no floating cities ain't no high tech Jetson homes. What you got in 2030 are broke people piled on top of each other. TV's (wallvision's) are cheap paper thin and everyone has one or several in their apartment/business apartment/home. People in the future will continue to get high and the new drug is shugga (sugar) and most of the neighbors are on it.
