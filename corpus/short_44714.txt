It is a multi-textural film with the visual appeal of an old school anthropological nature documentary set in the male garden of Eden. A lost paradise of the Brazilian Amazon. The sex the desire and the chasing are universal primitive animal instincts. This film portrays a territory free from taboos where all types of tribes and a diverse typology of men communicate through the universal language of cruising. It is playfully animalistic but also very human a cruising performance with explicit sex.
