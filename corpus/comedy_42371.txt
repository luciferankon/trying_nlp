The brother and sister Zuzana ('Dagmar Havlová' (qv)) and Petr ('Jirí Lábus' (qv)) are quite a notorious couple. They are fond of preparing people unpleasant surprises and are amusing by it. They dress a figure in a shop-window after a man standing at the pavement. The resemblance of the figure and a living man whose name is Zezulka is so striking that they decide to take a figure which they call Ronald to a trip with Karel ('Ludek Sobota' (qv)) Zuzana's suitor.
