This classic opens with a sensational low-angle circular track movement as Chandika cult followers meet in a dungeon of flickering lights and deep shadow. As the more rationalist King Krantivarma (Varde) banned human or animal sacrifices from the increasingly fanatical festivals dedicated to the goddess the cult's high priest (Chandramohan/Date) orders the hapless Vishwagupta (Kelkar) to kill the king. He obeys but is then betrayed by the perfidious priest and caught. His son Madhavgupta (Mane) and daughter Sumitra (Apte) together with the princess (Tarkhad) and the people finally overthrow the priest. There are several famous scenes including the twice-told legend of the churning of the seas once by the priest to show how evil must be exorcised and again by a good general to show how demons often appear disguised as gods. Although invoking divine intervention when Madhavgupta is about to be sacrificed the film's strongly political thrust has the people rise in revolt. Avanti Nagar residents worship Devi Maa Chandika and sacrifice humans and animals to appease Her. When Raja Krantivarma bans this sacrifice his very own Rajguru rebels and incites a group of religious zealots to assassinate him. They chose Yashodharma for this gruesome task which he carries out by stabbing the king to death. But shortly thereafter Yashodharma is apprehended with the assistance of Rajguru himself and after the coronation ceremony of Maharani Mohini is sentenced to be tortured killed and his remains fed to dogs. Mohini also orders death to the rest of Yashodharma's family namely his son Madhavgupta and daughter Sumitra. Madhavgupta is apprehended while Sumitra goes to take shelter in a monastery. Acting on the orders of the Rajguru amidst rising animosity between Hindus and Buddhists she orders that the next human sacrifice be none other than Madhavgupta himself.
