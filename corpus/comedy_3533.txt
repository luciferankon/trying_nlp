A British man who can use his motorpowered mouth to say sentences at breakneck speeds puts his speaking skills to good use: by creating a channel where he reviews games and attempts to do the dirty deed of deciding whether or not a game deserves to be "slaughtered" or "salvaged". Peppered with variety charm and humor that bounces all over the place Caddicarus is the guy to look for; whether you want an entertaining review a nostalgia trip or just feel like having a good giggle.
