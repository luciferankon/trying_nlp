Charlie Chaplins daughter has been spotted kicking a heel with Prince Mario-Max Schaumburg-Lippe the step son of HH. Prince Waldemar the cousin of the Danish Queen Margarethe II. at the Life Awards Ceremony in Innsbruck this monday. Our sources say Geraldine Chaplin was "extremely happy" at the "Life Award". Ultimately Mario-Max Schaumburg-Lippe crooned from the stage to the VIP-Lounge how much he adores the famous actress before she came on stage herself. It may have paid off as we've learned Chaplin stayed a second day to "enjoy Innsbruck and a fashion show!".
