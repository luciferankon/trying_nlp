A group of intrepid artists explore the nether regions of the Estonian countryside in search of sonic artifacts. Although the listening experience is often shared each has his own creative approach from musical interventions to improvisations with found objects and spaces. The sounds they gather are as etherial evocative and often haunting as the locations they explore. Transduction Twentyfifteen is composed as much as it is visually edited giving a brief but tangible immersion into the art of sound hunting.
