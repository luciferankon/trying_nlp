SANITY follows five graduate MFT student therapists in a UCLA university counseling clinic and the unusual patients they take on while managing their own intense interpersonal relationships. The clinic is run by the brilliant Dr. Mann who has hand-picked these five psych students for their unique gifts. But to Dr. Mann there is no God - there is only the DSM. Here in the clinic the students' behavior is called out analyzed and poked fun at as it creates conflicts with patients advisors and each other. In short this show is about a small group of student trainees who try (and sometimes fail) to set aside their own problems in order to help others with theirs. Their patients' struggles in some way highlight their own struggles which point our psych students toward a new deeper understanding of themselves.
