A documentary crew followed a young comedian for six months in order to track his progress in achieving his dream: money sex fame. The feature film is broken into three parts named after these three dreams. It not only chronicles the sometimes awkward exchanges between it's 19-year old subject (Ash Caton) and the people in his life but also contains archived stand up sets dating back to 2008. The story is also told through interview based talking heads and features original music by balam. As Ash's life brings him the cusp of all three of his ideal marks of success the film observes the decisions he makes that gradually deny him of all three. A comedy-mockumentary that examines the ego of an artist his relationships with those he loves and hates as well as the relationship between his stage persona and his true self.
