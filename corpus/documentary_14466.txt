By the time of his death in 2010 over the course of half a century Giuseppe Panza amassed a priceless collection of more than 2500 pieces of contemporary art. But Panza's mission wasn't to own great art it was to share it with the world. Panza donated or sold most of his collection to museums around the world notably the Guggenheim in New York the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (LA MOCA) and Villa Panza Italy. Yet few of the viewing public know his name nor the vast contributions he made to the art world through his patronage. The documentary film of Giuseppe Panza di Biumo's life Panza: Discovering Infinity chronicles all the important moments that shaped Panza as a man and as a collector - from a lonely childhood to a near death experience in adolescence to escaping the Fascists in Switzerland discovering spirituality philosophy and love and the freedom of American Abstract Art to the birth of an art collection and his fight to keep it together for all to see. Without Giuseppe Panza's support many contemporary masters of our time may have never been discovered including Rothko Klein Lichtenstein Judd Turrell and many others. Panza: Discovering Infinity is not only the biography of a remarkable man but also a panoramic journey into some of the most important movements and controversial artists in art history.
