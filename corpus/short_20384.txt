This documentary explores the road conditions of the Southern city of New Orleans Louisiana and takes a deeper look at the plaguing pothole problem. The filmmakers interview a local geologist who describes the main causes of pothole formation as well as several other local residents. These locals verbalize their daily encounters with the street's potholes and their personal thoughts and feelings towards the city's (lack of productive and effective) response.
