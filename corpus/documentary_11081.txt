Madame President is the quintessential story of politics and power - in a microcosm. The story of Freiberga coming to power are fascinating and bizarre. It's about showdowns with Russia power politics mysticism...even hope. And probably the fastest rise to power in political history. Frieberga's political style is unusual to say the least. She's been called everything from an iron lady to a white witch. Aside from the obvious Thatcher comparisons she's most often likened to Pierre Elliot Trudeau because of her razor sharp intellect.
