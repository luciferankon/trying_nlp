Joe's on top of the world. He's got a scholarship to play college football and get the degree of his dreams and he's got a great girlfriend. He asks her to go with him to college. He loses the football slot which cancels his scholarship and his girlfriend friendzones him. In Joe's mind his life ended and his best friend shows him alcohol as a way to kill the pain and have some fun.
