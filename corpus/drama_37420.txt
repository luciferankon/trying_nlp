In this modern epic Kim Nguyen exposes the ruthless edge of our increasingly digital world. Cousins from New York Vincent (Eisenberg) and Anton (SkarsgÄºrd) are players in the high-stakes game of High Frequency Trading where winning is measured in milliseconds. Their dream? To build a fiber-optic cable straight between Kansas and New Jersey making them millions. But nothing is straightforward for this flawed pair. Anton is the brains Vincent is the hustler and together they push each other and everyone around them to breaking point on their quixotic adventure. Constantly breathing down their necks is their old boss Eva Torres (Hayek) a powerful intoxicating and manipulative trader who will stop at nothing to come between them and beat them at their own game. No matter what the cost Vincent and Anton are determined to cut through America only to find redemption at the end of their line not through money but through family and reconnecting to the land.
