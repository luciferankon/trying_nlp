Two Latvian adventurers- Janis and Andis- dared to quit everyday routine and start the journey to fulfill their dream- to travel 28000 km from Riga to Australia the same route never taken by anyone before. Back then they didn't have modern high quality GoPro cameras or a professional filming crew with a large budget following them. It was only them the road and the destination and the people with their unique stories that they met along the road the different cultures and crazy adventures. As a final result a documentary film ''On the way of freedom'' was made this title was given to the film because for the two adventurers the road itself is the ultimate freedom.
