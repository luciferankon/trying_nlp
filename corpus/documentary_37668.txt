In 2005 Stephanie Hampton's son died in the UK of a rare form of cancer called Burkitts Lymphoma. In 2010 she felt the time was right to travel to Malawi where this rare form of tumour based cancer is prevalent in children; she wanted to understand more about the disease that took her son's life and also find out what can be done to speed up the diagnosis and treatment of its country's children. Surviving Burkitt's is not just a moving personal journey but a journey into the nature of loss shown through a remarkable mother who has turned her grief into positive energy in order to help a country's children.
