After a summer working in a fish factory and sleeping in a car in Homer Alaska traveler and filmmaker Tyler Ludowitz took a one way flight to India with nothing but a backpack a super 8 camera and as little as two hours worth of film. Working with limited celluloid Ludowitz had to be exceedingly selective with what he shot sometimes going weeks without rolling the shutter. Quiet Place in the Universe documents his travels as he made his way through Thailand China and eventually back to the United States. The film he returned with is intensely brutal wholly raw and at times unexpectedly beautiful. Quiet Place sets itself apart by invoking a cinematic experience that is truly D.I.Y. to the fullest extreme.
