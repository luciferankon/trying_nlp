A man is seated at a table looking over his mail. Finally he selects one contained in a black bordered envelope which he opens in great haste fearing to receive sad news from home. Judging from the expression on his face the news is anything but sad as he learns much to his surprise that great wealth has been bequeathed to him by a distant relative recently deceased. This is another film of wonderful facial expression.
