On hearing the news of the death of his sister a Buddhist monk leaves the temple where he has lived since childhood and struggles to adjust to life on the outside as an uncle to a young niece and as a businessman running a hair salon in a small Thai town in a southern province. He even must learn to ride a bicycle and zip up his trousers without injuring himself. He is confronted by a flood of feelings - sexual for a woman and family friend across the street; as well as fear and hatred for the Muslims who he believes is responsible for his sister's death and other sorrows in his life.
