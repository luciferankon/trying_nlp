Three recruits land in Navy boot camp in San Diego: Potter from Kansas wealthy Benson (who has experience with yachts) and dirt-poor Dan. Kansas gets in trouble for not having his cover. Dan has color-vision problems. The company is sent on a training mission to Hawaii though Dan is sent instead to the Medical Officer apparently to be discharged which plunges him into despair. But the Navy isn't quite done with Dan.
