The film is told as a personal encounter with exiled Sri Lankan journalists who have been "silenced" and almost killed in their home country because they exposed war crimes corruption and massacres of civilians. They claim these crimes have been committed by the state. A free press and independent journalism-is a fundamental part of a democratic society. Today however information is increasingly exchanged through a global network. What that means in short is that restrictions on a free press somewhere in the world become restrictions everywhere in the world.
