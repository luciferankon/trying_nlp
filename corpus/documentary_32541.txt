A portrait of a man with a boundless passion. Smeets is a control freak for 45 years in charge of the oldest pop festival in the world Pinkpop. "Pinkpop is his life" says his granddaughter Kim. "He will only stop when he is dead". Mick Jagger comments on the legendary Pinkpop 1979 when he refused to join Peter Tosh on stage driving Jan Smeets to tears. The frustration of that moment is still as vivid as it was then.
