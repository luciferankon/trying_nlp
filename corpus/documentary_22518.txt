'Des Pardes' (Home & Abroad) is a TV Documentary produced to highlight the real stories of illegal migrants from South Asia. The documentary swims against the South Asian mainstream media representation of an auspicious picture of life in UK. In places where day-to-day life for an ordinary person is a continuous up hill struggle this representation of life in UK seems very alluring to the point where people are willing to risk their lives and use any illegal means to get to UK. To research the project Director Khurrum M. Sultan was involved in volunteering with numerous charities and speaking to the people suffering on the ground. 'Des Pardes' was granted special permission to accompany the UK Immigration Enforcement teams on numerous raids and allowed access to detention centres to speak to the various detainees. 'Des Pardes' also received access to areas usually closed to the media. The documentary hopes to paint a true picture of the dangers and risks involved with illegal migration.
