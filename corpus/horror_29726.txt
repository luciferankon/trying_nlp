Junkbucket follows a group of kids to Lake Pakajanomo for a weekend of sex drinking and drugs. Unfortunately waiting for them in the woods is a bucket-headed monster who plans to kill all of them and take their junk (to make up for the fact that his were cut off by his momma as a boy). Not for the weak of parts this satire is guaranteed to scare your junk off!
