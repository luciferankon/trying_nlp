On a hot day two rebellious high school friends Rickie and JT decide to skip class and hang out at an abandoned derelict Asylum for the mentally ill for some beers and fun. After breaking into the place the fun begins with some bashing and smashing in the maze of half-lit corridors dark rooms and narrow pathways of the institution when all of a sudden JT discovers the body of a young naked woman covered with a plastic film. In the light of this grotesque yet unexpected finding unresolvable questions will begin to rise as this seemingly unresponsive girl will start growling and gnashing. Who is this girl? Was she a patient here or was she some sort of a guinea pig that a scientist used to perform some crazy experiments on it? In the end how human is this girl that simply cannot die?
