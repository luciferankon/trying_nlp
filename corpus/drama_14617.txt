Margarita lives with her son Axel and his older sisters Antonia Alejandra and Alicia. Their flat is like a cosy cave where they play music eat sleep and argue in the warm lamplight. An intimate family cocoon. The fact that Margarita lives locked up in a room beyond the bathroom is just how things are. The children communicate with their mother through a small window giving her blankets DVDs and reading material and celebrating her birthday in the corridor. When she's eventually had enough it's Axel that must decide what to do.
