The Graduation is a classic teenage comedy very playful sometimes going a bit over the edge. Moments of reality in the film often alternate with dreams and visions. The basic plot is the attempt of a gang of high school seniors to graduate while not working too hard at it even if they have to resort to a bit of underhanded tactics. The two main protagonists hack into the Ministry's server where they look for the answers to the final exam questions in vain though they get into deep water for it. It almost looks like they will be taken away from the exams by a special police unit because of hacking.
