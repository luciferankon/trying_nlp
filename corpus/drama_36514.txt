Beginning at the break of dawn and ending the next morning the story set around a rugged city intersection follows the path of a marked one-thousand-peso bill as it transfers from one character to another returning to its originator in the end blood-tainted. The money leads us to each of the five offbeat characters all in desperate need of their soul's redemption: a disillusioned tabloid reporter planning to commit suicide in a motel a nightclub dancer con prostitute who has avowed to give her kid sister a better life a fallen henchman resurfacing to score big time a chronic runaway teenage girl held captive as sex slave by a cop and a long-suffering son bearing a sadomasochistic relationship with his brutish half-paralyzed father who behaves like a mad dictator in his wheelchair. Like a ticking time bomb the story unravels with unforgiving immediacy and explodes in the end with a tabloid front-pager triple homicide where death seems to have come full circle.
