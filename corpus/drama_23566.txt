In this science-fiction-black-comedy Chester an introverted anxiety-ridden genius develops a mind-control serum in order to take over a college campus. The only thing that halts Chester's ability to control everything around him is Felix a boy dying rapidly of brain cancer. Told from a number of perspectives the film is a narrative melting-pot with equal doses of many genres.
