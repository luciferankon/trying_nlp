In 2001 our film crew came to film a documentary about Michael Brewer and the orphanage he founded in a two story house located in a residential area of Port au Prince. More than 50 children lived in the house. Their backgrounds told the same stories: abandoned or orphaned by parents. Michael was the only hope they had to stay off the streets. We came back to find out what has happened to the orphanage we arrived to find that Michael no longer had his orphanage. Due to the periodic upheavals of the Haitian government as well as the economic downturn in the US funding disappeared and the orphanage was forced to shut its doors. In addition the recent hurricanes have left the area in turmoil. The children were forced back to the streets.
