A collective film coordinated by Felipe Bragan√ßa and Marina Meliande (see also The Joy). They sent a letter of 'unease' to filmmakers in which they asked for love utopia and explosions... The many-faceted and poetic result is wonderful to watch and balm to the soul. An experimental collective film lasting little more than an hour compiled from 10 episodes by a total of 14 different young Brazilian filmmakers.
