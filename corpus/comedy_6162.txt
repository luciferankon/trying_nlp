A mockumentary following three very different Bristol artists and an over ambitious curator as they fail to stage the biggest art exhibition of their careers. It is a satirical look at the people trying to negotiate their way through the fickle art world; a place where vegan taxidermy meets stenciled vaginas and concepts are wrapped up in masking tape and sold to the highest bidder.
