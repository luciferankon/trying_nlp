To celebrate the coming twenty-fifth anniversary (in 1988) of the British science fiction-fantasy series this one-hour special produced for broadcast on American PBS stations fondly looks back to the early years of the program with interviews with Patrick Troughton who played the second incarnation of the title character the Doctor- a Time Lord from planet Gallifrey and Carole Ann Ford granddaughter companion of the first Doctor who was played by the late William Hartnell. Also interviewed are Terry Nation creator of the Daleks- popular foes of the Doctor and John Nathan Turner producer of the series in the 1980s. Viewers are also introduced to Sylvester McCoy the actor selected by Nathan-Turner in 1987 to play the Doctor in his seventh incarnation.
