It was a dark and rainy night. Momentarily distracted salaryman Motomura runs over a young lady on a bicycle panics and flees the scene. In discussion with his family they all agree to cover up the crime reported on the news the following day. The front of the car is damaged so they clear a space in the loungeroom and bring the car inside. The family works at scrapping the car and disposing of the parts. Motomura's family is riven with crises but co-operation in the conspiracy seems to bring them together. However the attention of a nosy neighbour threatens the scheme.
