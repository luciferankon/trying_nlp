The revolutionary science of "neuroplasticity" - a concept that expands not just our knowledge of how our brains work but how we use them. For centuries the human brain has been thought of as incapable of fundamental change. People suffering from neurological defects brain damage or strokes were usually written-off as hopeless cases. But recent and continuing research into the human brain is radically changing how we look at the potential for neurological recovery. The human brain as we are now quickly learning has a remarkable ability to change itself - in fact even to rewire itself. The Brain that Changes Itself is directed by Mike Sheerin and is co-written by Dr. Norman Doidge and Mike Sheerin and produced by 90th Parallel Productions Ltd. in association with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and ARTE France.
