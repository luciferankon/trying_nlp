Documentary in which the camera of Jose Luis Guer√≠n returns almost forty years later to the same places where the mythical film of John Ford 'The quiet Man' was shot. The locality of Innisfree still keeps alive the memory of the filming among the survivors full of historical references in the other inhabitants as well as the particular way of seeing the life of the deep Ireland that Ford wanted to portray.
