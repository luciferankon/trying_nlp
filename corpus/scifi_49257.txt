Day 1 set in a near Post- Apocalyptic future Kevin Hayes (Walt Sloan) walks to live. That's what he's told to do by the military authorities. Rumors of a disease that makes people fight to the death force humanity to remain apart. Keeping him alive are Kevin's memories of the past and the never ending quest to find his daughter. Kevin's journey takes him to a new military sector controlled by Captain Reynolds (Harold Dennis). The Captain has gone rogue with his band of renegade soldiers and he has a plan - a terrifying plan to eliminate those he calls "the infected." The only people standing in the way of the Captain are two new recruits Benett and Williams (Andrew Jacob DeHart and Jessica Oberhausen). These forces come to a climatic ending where the line between good and evil is blurred and Kevin will do whatever it takes to stay alive.
