Before the Movies is KLE Pictures' fourth completed film and their first intentionally starring their dog Bisbee. It's a mockumentary about what Andrew Sean Ryan and Matthew supposedly did before making movies. They drift from occupation to occupation in this film made in a period of only 24 hours. Some of the jobs are a security guard private investigator Bisbee's personal manager ballerina comedians and even a pirate. While the infamous "Ghost Hunters" segment may drag on too long "Before the Movies" is overall better than its predecessors.
