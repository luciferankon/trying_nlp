A Moving Family Story is an essay documentary about a family's cross-country move and subsequent divorce told through the eyes of the filmmaker. It features a collection of 8mm family films animated sequences voice-over interviews conversations and observational narration the juxtaposition of which creates an intimate introspective look at a collapsing family and the slippery identities carved from memory and celluloid records. In the act of piecing together the family's story the filmmaker narrator engages in a stream-of-consciousness interaction with the family of his childhood as revealed by 1960s and 1970s film footage and the often-contradictory emotionally charged memories of the family members today.
