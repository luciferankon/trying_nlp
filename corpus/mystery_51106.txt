Jennifer Shannon (Lori Loughlin) has a gift for finding rare treasures hidden in garage sales that she can resell at her consignment store Rags to Riches. But her keen eye for finding valuables also gets her involved in the criminal investigations that happen at the very second-hand sales she frequents. When Jennifer's friend and self-storage facility owner Martin (Michael Kopsa) turns up murdered-just hours after auctioning off an abandoned storage unit full of unique items to Jennifer-she is immediately pulled on the case as a key eyewitness. Working with Detective Lynwood (Kevin O'Grady) Jennifer helps single out a disgruntled customer as the prime suspect while she and her business partner Danielle (Strange) sift through boxes from the auction. As her husband Jason (Bacic) worries about her safety Jennifer starts to get over her head when there is a break-in at her store and a run-in with Martin's angry wife. Then Jennifer and Danielle discover their new merchandise contains the sparkly evidence they needed all along to nail the surprising real culprit and they must race to save a life-and put their own on the line.
