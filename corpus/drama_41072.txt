General Stampoff takes control in Kosnovia and to insure his position as the country's strong man he installs Prince Alexis Delgrade the idle son of Prince Michael as the titular ruler. Alexis surprises everyone however and shocks the reactionary Stampoff by instituting a series of democratic reforms. However his public success cannot make up for his personal problems as Alexis is unable to marry his sweetheart Joan Cameron because she was born in America and thus could not reign as queen. Then Alexis discovers that his mother came from Indiana thereby making him as much an American as a Kosnovian and also invalidating his claim to the throne. As a result he abdicates and marries Joan while Michael vowing to maintain his son's democratic policies takes over as king.
