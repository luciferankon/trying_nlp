College is over now for Alexis Sean Christian Daquan and Gary. For four years all they could think about was graduation day and now it is here and they are left thinking the proverbial what now?" The next phase of their life starts in 4 3 2 1 and ready or not here they come. Everyone have different dreams and goals but the common denominator is his or her desire to make it and be larger than life. When they discover how serious Alexis is in her dream to become a singer they see an opportunity for a mutual goal and join forces to help her make it. Sometimes you realize that the only family that you truly have is the one that you have made and when it is all said and done "We Are Fam."
