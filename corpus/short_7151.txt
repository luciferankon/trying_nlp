Man in the Maze was 1 of 5 films selected out of over 1300 films to win the Sundance Short Film Challenge supported by the Bill and Melinda Gate's Foundation. The competition showcases stories that communicate how we can support one another to end poverty and hunger. More than 30% of the food we eat in America originates in Mexico and travels north through Southern Arizona an area with one of the highest poverty and food insecurity rates in the country. The huge amount of food that is wasted along the way is just one indicator that our current system isn't working. Man in the Maze takes us on a journey through the borderlands where we see how people are coming up with innovative solutions to mend our broken food system. Food activist writer and conservationist Gary Paul Nabhan sits at the intersection of inspired food activists farmers and change-makers. Here where it seems like there is no hope there is a grassroots food movement shifting the way we grow and eat our food. The "Man in the Maze" was originally created as an illustration of the emergence story by the Tohono O'odham Indians of Southern Arizona. The symbol has been adopted by other people because of its symbolism of life's cycles and eternal motion and also of the choices we are confronted with. The right choices lead us to a point of harmony with all things no matter how hard or long the road taken. Since the film has been released there's been an inspired conversation happening around food waste. Efforts are now being made in Nogales AZ to build a compost facility to divert some of the produce from ending up in the landfill.
