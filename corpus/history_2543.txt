A young man named David Loomis (Graeme Brookes) is a doctor following in his father's footsteps but refuses to participate in the obsession that ruined him. A firm believer that Michael Myers is long dead - that is until a patient he takes on by the name of Lindsey Wallace (Leah Green) is convinced that the bogeyman is after her. As these two lives come together little do they realise that they are heading down a path which will bring them face to face with evil personified...an event that will have tragic consequences for one of them.
