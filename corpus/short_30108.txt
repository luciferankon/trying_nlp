Immersion explores the fascinating life of the aquatic creatures who frequently submerge themselves in the warm waters of a local swimming pool. People of all ages and conditions do what they can to accustom themselves to a medium that is not at first their own. The film shot entirely below water is a literal immersion into the medium in which life originated. A descent into the emotional depths of the individual.
