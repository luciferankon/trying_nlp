Having inherited a hotel two brothers have very different ideas as to how to re-float it as a profitable venture. The one wants to turn it into a love hotel with pretty girls from Thailand so that the customers will be able to save themselves the fare to Bangkok. The other one has in mind an institute for the moral edification of the young. In both cases the hotel would be a meeting place though of very different characters.
