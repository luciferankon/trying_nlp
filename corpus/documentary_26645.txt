The poet and painter Lawrence Ferlinghetti is among the world's living monuments to arts and letters. For well over a half century Ferlinghetti helped shape the currents of poetry and literature with his forceful engagement with society and an ideological position that often found him at odds with the political currents of his day. Ferlinghetti's quiet behind the scenes demeanor and disarming mien may have assuaged or even fooled certain opponents while in reality he was a literary mercenary a rebel at the forefront of our own cultural revolution.
