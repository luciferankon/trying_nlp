After an untimely death he enjoys the comforts of Heaven but a wrongly perceived crises (God doesn't understand that the Devils are a hockey team)results in the need for a miracle. Tom is the unlucky choice to be risen up to fight the Devils. Unfortunately Heaven botches the job and Tom is a rotting corpse. The only solution is for him to drink a lot of alcohol to preserve himself. The side effect is that he gets intoxicated!
