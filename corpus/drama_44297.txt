In the Malwa-Nimar region of Western Madhya Pradesh (An Indian State) 'Kalichaat' is the name for a kind of exceptionally hard rock. Encountering it while digging for water is considered no less than a disaster in this ofteh drought-affected region. At the same time it also presents a ray of hope because it is believed that beneath 'Kalichaat' lies boundless water if it can be broken to reach it. The story of a million farmers. The story revolves around Sitaram a farmer like many other in central India with less than limited means. Trying hard to meet ends and provide for his family the basics of life. The problem repeatedly failing monsoon the lifeline of Indian farmers making his land yield nothing but weed despite him doing all he can. His family of 5 including his wife two sons and a daughter suffers along. Sitaram's efforts to quench the thirst of his land leads him try and dig a well in his land. The hard sound of mattock hitting the dreadful black rock - Kalichaat - is nothing but a disaster as cracking Kalichaat and reaching water beneath will require means beyond his approach. But to match adversities with his will he approaches the local bank specifically established to meet the needs of farmers only to realize that getting help there is even complex than breaking Kalichaat. In this state of despair the showering water coming out of a tube well drilling at his village makes him wonder why can't he have one at his land. A hope for him perceived a gamble by many including his wife. Again the seemingly never ending tryst authorities loan sharks and religious gurus while keeping his family hopeful for a better future begins.
