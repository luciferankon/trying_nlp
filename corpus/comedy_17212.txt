Arthur Tate rose to his fame wealth and respectability quickly from humble beginnings as a naive and somewhat bumbling police constable in a small English town. He attributes this rise to his mantra: "believe in people have faith in mankind and never search for evil" which was instilled in him by his mother. Although the tenets of this mantra did help his rise was also due to his romantic affection for three women: dressmaker Violet Lawson whose husband went missing and was presumed murdered; Lily the Baroness von Lukenberg whose husband had a seeming affinity for the issues of selective breeding and spiders; and movie producer Marigold Marado who wanted to make a realistic film of a political revolution. His rise was also due to Mrs. Tate who always seemed to have an extra piece of information which would make her suggest to the people in power that her son Arthur be provided a position where he could do more good. Perhaps Mrs. Tate had a grander plan for herself.
