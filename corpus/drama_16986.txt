Living in a crowded New York City apartment does not mean getting close to the neighbors. During the hectic Christmas season the residents go about their lives while an old widower sits alone in his living room reading a card that says his son won't be coming home for Christmas. Meanwhile a dancer packs up her ballet shoes to give up on her dream in the big city. A financial consultant can't commit. An artist tries to confront his fear about talking to the girl upstairs. A washed up journalist can't find the right story. And three students more concerned with popularity than making friends all walk into an elevator. 8 strangers stuck in an elevator 8 stories high. 8 strangers are about to find out what being a true neighbor means.
