A group of volunteers formed the Women's Board of Ravinia Festival (the oldest outdoor music venue in America) in 1962. Over the next five decades they became the largest donor to the not-for-profit festival donating more than $25 million to help keep classical music alive. Along the way they started Ravinia's acclaimed REACH*TEACH*PLAY education outreach programs with Artists in the Classroom Teacher Training and the creation of several "El Sistema" style student orchestras.
