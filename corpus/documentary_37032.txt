A Category 3 storm named Katrina hit the Gulf Coast with sustained winds in excess of 125 miles per hour. It was the worst-case scenario. Within hours eighty percent of New Orleans lay under water. Entire communities in Alabama Mississippi and Louisiana were leveled and nearly half a million residents were homeless or displaced. There was no food fuel or water and electricity wouldn't be back for weeks or months. More than ever the survivors of Katrina needed their monthly Social Security checks medicines and Welfare benefits. In a first-ever television event the U.S. Postal Inspection Service teams up with The Weather Channel to present "Storm Stories: Postmark Katrina". This gripping story follows a team of Postal Inspectors as they struggle to restore mail service to the battered Gulf Coast. It's a sleepless race to restore hope.
