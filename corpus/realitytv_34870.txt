Host Al Sharpton and Stephanie Raye give a series of tasks to a group of young men who hate their day jobs. The multiple tasks are designed to see if they can succeed in various challenges based upon their DREAM jobs and throughout the show the hosts give the players coaching as to what they are doing right and doing wrong.. The winner gets a profession gig doing what they've always wanted to do. Can these guys make the leap and do what they dream of doing? Like all reality shows some of the contestants will be up for crushing disappointments as some are eliminated each episode.
