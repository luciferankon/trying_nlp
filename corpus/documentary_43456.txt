Prosecuted as a revolutionary banned as a priest arrested as a rebel celebrated as an artist. This is Frans Wuytack's truly inspiring and overwhelming story. He unchained a social and cultural revolution in the 60's changing the lives of so many people from the Venezuelan slums to the Belgian Ports. An epic journey made by his son Fabio Wuytack.
