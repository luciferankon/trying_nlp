Two friends go to Francis' hacienda house set in Victorias to borrow money. Instead of lending them money Francis proposes a drug deal involving Ecstasy which will earn the two a lot of money. But before they are able to get the drugs Francis gets a heart attack and dies. Thus the two look for the Ecstasy all over the house. In the meantime a parade of characters - Francis' siblings his pusher his girlfriend his GRO's - come into the house and look for Francis. What ensues is a hilarious cat-and-mouse game wherein the two friends hide the body or make him look like he's sleeping while they search for the drugs.
