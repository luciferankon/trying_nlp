J. Lyle is sitting in a chair when his guts climb out of his body crawl to his shoulder and begins to discuss what he should do. There is the Good: The Heart The bad: The Brain and the Ugly: The Penis and also a couple of others. In the end they sing a song about how it takes guts to sing this song. J. Lyle's goal is to get rich and the only way to accomplish that is to rid his apartment building of its tenants tear it down and erect a toxic waste dump. He and his idiot-savant sidekick Skip have managed to scare away almost all of the tenants and the plan seems to be working until he meets the last tenant Gwen and falls in love. He vows to win her affection and as usual he doesn't care how. He then meets a magical dog who has the power to zap J. Lyle into the bodies of his victims including the oldest tenant Skip and Gwen. When he is literally forced to put himself in other people's shoes he realizes what a selfish and empty life he's led. It is through these surreal and outrageous experiences as well as a long talk with his internal organs that J. Lyle learns the value of love and empathy and resolves to make a fresh start.
