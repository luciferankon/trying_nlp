The semi-steamy story (more in promise than actual deliverance) is set in Nassau and finds Mike an American charter boat captain involved in a romance with tourist Jan but Jan's aunt Elizabeth also has the hots for Mike and tries to break up the romance. She hides her bracelet in a straw bag belonging to Mike's mate Eban and then claims it was stolen. She then agrees to drop the theft charges if Mike will ditch Jan and go off with her. What's a poor guy to do? Well mostly hang around and listen to Leslie Scott Kay Barnes Irene Williams and other Calypso performers sing "Cocoanut Water Rum and Gin" "Wanna Do Nothin' All Day" and "Island WOMEN" and watch "The Limbo" being danced.
