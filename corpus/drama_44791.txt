Kerala famously known as Gods own country is endowed with natural beauty with its lush green landscapes and rivers crisscrossing the length and breadth of the state. At the northernmost part of Kerala is the Kasargod district once bestowed with greenery is now a haunted place. The use of endosulfan a highly dangerous pesticide had catapulted the entire area a land of diseases and trauma. Widespread use of Endosulfan at cashew plantations had not only killed pests but affected the ecological balance of the area and severely affected humans and animals alike and resulted in diseases ranging from physical deformity to genetic problems thus making the entire district a symbol of morbidity. Following widespread agitation against the usage of endosulfan its use has been stopped by the government but neverthless decades of widespread usage had killed thousands and made many more living victims. Having seen and experienced this atrocious use of chemicals and its side effects at Kasargod which is nearby my native I though of a film on this issue through which I could bring into limelight and make people aware the tragedy of unethical use of chemicals and other pesticides.
