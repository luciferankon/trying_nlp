A sprawling portrait of rural life in Sri Lanka; the story revolves around a boy and his friend--a blind girl who he accidentally 'heals' by giving her sight. Though the girl believes the boy healed her in reality the boy has no such powers. The father of the boy fools the village folk into believing he's a healer but ultimately the sham is exposed causing the village to revolt against the boy and his family.
