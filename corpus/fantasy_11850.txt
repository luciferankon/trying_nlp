Lineage takes place in a backdrop of medieval fantasy. The hero a member of the royal bloodline heads for his homeland - the Kingdom of Aden - with his guardian knights determined to avenge the death of his father and win back his kingdom. The game scenario is based on the comic book Lineage by Il-sook Shin but the story has been expanded upon throughout the years focusing first on the development of pledges dedicated to the prince or princess of their choice and now on the uprising that the pretender king is planning with the dark elves. The game is steeped in detail and great care is taken to leave the game's medieval feel intact.
