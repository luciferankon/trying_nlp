Iowa farmers Judy and Charlie Swanson just want to stay family-size; but all around them farms grow to five seven even ten thousand acres. This personal and revealing documentary follows the Swansons and their three grown children through the recession roller coaster as they struggle to live their dream of farming together as one extended family. Along the way we meet a cast of determined and individualistic characters - from hog farmers to local vegetable growers - all bent on making a living from the land.
