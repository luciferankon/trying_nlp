What inspires people to make a stand - no matter how formidable the challenge or severe the consequences? This exciting documentary presents the history at Greenpeace as a case study in what happens when ordinary people join together - with courage and imagination - to fight for what they believe is right. With dramatic stories from the early days of environmentalism and from the front lines of a current campaign the film reveals how extraordinary things can happen when you follow your heart.
