A dark and conflicted erotic noir feature "The Contemptuous Ruby" takes a tried and true concept of treachery and sexual debauchery and spins it into a well-defined psycho thriller with a classic story line. The dark and foggy craggy coast location of the northern California town of Bodega Bay makes the script feel all that more intimate and personal. Opening in a large blue late night swimming pool the writers quickly establish the tone for the piece. The main protagonist offers sexual tension and manipulates the lives of those around her. The writers give this story a sardonic and tragic element with a main character being a tattoo of Comedy and Tragedy as a metaphor to the torment of a paralyzed man Walter held captive in a mangled war torn body while bound to his wheelchair. Walter's mute state and the immobility of his hands while reliving his days of happiness and glory in his mind's eye are clearly visualized by extreme close-ups of his face and his eyes while he sits and watches 8mm film over and over again. His young and beautiful bride Ruby from days long past has degenerated into an aging and perverse sadist who tortures him with malicious indifference by performing acts of carnal lust with complete strangers while he Walter is forced to watch. By the time we're introduced to Ruby her evil is developed and her inevitable quest for absolution and annihilation is revealed. The fact that she gets both serves the audience well. The writers lead you in and out of Ruby's psychosis where the dark and craggy coast of Bodega Bay offers up a diabolical noir setting.
