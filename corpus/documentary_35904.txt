Asylum is a film very much derived from chaos expressing implicitly the ideas conjured up by its title. A strange mix of both documentary and fiction where in the future a group of people are looking back at the twentieth century. A virus has wiped out most of the culture of the twentieth century leaving just fragments of a project called 'The Perimeter Fence' to be pieced together. These fragments make up a documentary about an exiled group of disparate yet similar minds.
