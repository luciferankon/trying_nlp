June 6th 1944: D-Day. Patrick Thomas a telegraphist in the Royal Navy boards a craft in Portsmouth as thousands of vessels and tens of thousands of soldiers prepare for the day that changed history. His landing craft would be part of the first wave on Sword Beach before heading offshore to cover communications for land battles. At night the craft would join others in forming a line to defend from E-Boats and Manned Torpedoes. During the day the crew were either catching up on sleep or taking part in sea rescues. June 25th 1944: Patrick's ship was sunk by an acoustic mine. He recalls regaining consciousness whilst already in the water bleeding from the head and covered in Battleship Grey paint. He watched the ship turn and sink to the bottom of the England Channel. Most of the crew went with it. With men and machine dropping like flies throughout the Second World War the ship and its men have largely vanished from history. Patrick and the families of the crew have no place to honor the fallen who sacrificed so much for our freedom. No one knows where those men ended up. There is no memorial to lay a wreathe. Seven decades later all that will change. 73 years after Patrick Thomas' British Navy ship went down during World War II fate brings complete stranger former rocker and current archaeologist John into Patrick's life. Fuelled by their unexpected bond John makes a shocking promise to find Patrick's ship and launch a memorial with the veteran by his side.
