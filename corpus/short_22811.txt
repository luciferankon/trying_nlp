Katia is late for her own Party. With a superficial smile on his lips she prepares to enter the party like a movie star who is right about to walk on the red carpet and has to shine like a star. Katia is a real hipster girl. She represents the attitude of the younger generation: she lives together with her girlfriend whom she does not really like and she is dating a guy because he is the most popular and best looking. The party is nothing special everything seems familiar and dull until Kuba Katia's ex-boyfriend shows up. Katia is looking for new experiences and emotional stability in shallow inauthentic relationships with peers and at parties. She engages in relationships with people who play with her as if she were a Barbie doll. The film primarily is a portrait of the 89-generation. In a country where past generations always had to fight for their freedom the generation born into the nation's recovery never experienced non-freedom and thus does not know how to value the freedom which was so long fought for. Eight of nine people are unable to cope with too many options and cannot make choices because there are too many routes to choose. They do not know how to deal with responsibility. They do not know where to go so they go round in circles and their own ideas about what life is. Lost within the circle they escape from treating each other and life seriously.
