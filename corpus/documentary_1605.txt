This 1954 film---50000 Royal miles in CinemaScope and Eastman Color/Colour---covers the earlier-in-the-year six-months tour of the British Commonwealth by Queen Elizabeth and Philip later joined by Prince Charles and Princess Anne toward the end of the trip. Those who wish can add the above four to the cast but the thought here is they don't qualify as actors. At least not in the normal sense. The footage includes visits to the Fiji Islands Tongo the Cocos Islands Ceylon Africa New Zealand and Australia. Lots of native music and tribal dances and scenery inbetween many many shots of the Royal pair arriving and departing. The title is the plot.
