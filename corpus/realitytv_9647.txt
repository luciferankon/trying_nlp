Small Business: Big World is a web-based documentary show about unique small businesses throughout the world. Whether it's a small town bar and grill or a corner coffee shop in the big city small businesses throughout the world are often the little fish in the big pond of their industry. The most common challenge for them is overcoming the public's tendency to walk past the unfamiliar shop in favor of the big name store they recognize. Our hosts Jevocas Green and Edward DeGruy are going to pull back the curtain on these small businesses and take the viewer inside to explore what they have been missing out on.
