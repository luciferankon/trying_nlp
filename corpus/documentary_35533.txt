Galileo's Sons is a documentary film about the only community of astrophysicists in the world who are theologians and philosophers: the Jesuits of the Vatican Observatory. This is a journey from old world to new from these Jesuits' headquarters in the Papal Summer Palace south of Rome to their advanced telescope on a mountain above the Arizona desert and from Galileo's trial to the overwhelming implications of modern science for our understanding of God.
