Angry Kid stands outdoors near a fish and chips shop eating his chips from a sheet of newspaper. He tosses one into the air and catches it in his mouth. But he's drawn the attention of a neighborhood dog who leaps high enough to catch a chip or two in mid air before Angry Kid cottons on to what's happening. "These are my chippies not for doggies" exclaims the Kid. Then he makes a big mistake.
