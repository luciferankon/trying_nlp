Georges's life is turned upside-down when he meets Yamina and decides to help her. While she seems to be persecuted and living in hiding Georges's reality is rooted in a daily routine without any surprises. Yamina's stories fascinate him: her happy childhood under the rhythm of a song the massacres in the 1990s in the Great South as well as her difficulties in Algeria and then in France. Georges spends more and more time with Yamina and is totally disorientated the day she disappears without a word. As his search for her unfolds Georges realizes that he knows nothing about her and that every person he meets who knew Yamina seems to have a different version of the young woman's life. Convinced that he must go to Algiers to save her Georges abandons everything and sets out on a journey without any concrete destination. His quest finally leads him to an oasis in the Sahara a desert that spreads as widely as this love story between Bonnevoie and Tabelbala.
