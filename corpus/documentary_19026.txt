This film was made by John Girdwood in 2012 to give perspective on youth and sports in deindustrialized cities like Flint Lansing and Detroit. All participants were contacted through Twitter. As a researcher Girdwood went in blind with some hypotheses but this film is not anything close to "investigative journalism" - it is an honest first step to research that will analyze the future of Flint/Lansing/Detroit in the post-industrial era (after the factories have left).
