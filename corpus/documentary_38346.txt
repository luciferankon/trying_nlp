The cinephiles are retired women from Spain Uruguay and Argentina who go to the movies every day. For them films are not only a support but also a safe and recurrent event in the days that go by and the cinema is a place where they can ease their loneliness and forget the passage of time. Like a drop of water fiction slaps their lives leaving a trace on their memory.
