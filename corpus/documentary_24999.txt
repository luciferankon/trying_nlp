Can a language save your life? Yes it can even an ancient one from the 15th century. Saved by Language tells the story of Moris Albahari a Sephardic Jew from Sarajevo (born 1930) who spoke Ladino/Judeo-Spanish his mother tongue to survive the Holocaust. Moris used Ladino to communicate with an Italian Colonel who helped him escape to a Partizan refuge after he ran away from the train taking Yugoslavian Jews to Nazi death camps. By speaking in Ladino to a Spanish-speaking US pilot in 1944 he was able to survive and lead the pilot along with his American and British colleagues to a safe Partizan airport.
