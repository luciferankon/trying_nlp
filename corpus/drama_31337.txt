After WWII Berlin lies in ruins. For Gustav Willi and their friends the rubble provides an adventurous dangerous playground. Especially for Gustav it helps pass the time as he longs for his father's return from a POW camp. One day a stranger arrives looking helpless and hopeless... Gerhard Lamprecht built his reputation during the 1920s and '30s with films like Emil and the Detectives (1931 script Billy Wilder) and socially-critical Berlin films based on the drawings of Heinrich Zille. In Somewhere in Berlin-his first postwar film made just months after the cessation of hostilities-he portrays the people of the shattered city with precision and psychological realism.
