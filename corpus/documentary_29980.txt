Ghosts of Amistad by Tony Buba is based on Marcus Rediker's The Amistad Rebellion: An Atlantic Odyssey of Slavery and Freedom (Penguin 2012). It chronicles a journey to Sierra Leone in 2013 to visit the home villages of the rebels who captured the slave schooner Amistad to interview elders about local memory of the incident and to search for the long-lost ruins of Lomboko the slave trading factory where their cruel transatlantic voyage began. The filmmakers rely on the knowledge of villagers fishermen and truck drivers to recover a lost history from below in the struggle against slavery and to explore the African origins of the heroes of the Amistad incident.
