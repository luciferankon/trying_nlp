In this format of absurd humor (the very title is a pointless anagram of the otherwise unrelated national radio show "Het Leugenpalais" literally 'palace of lies' in Dutch) numerous sets of (stock-)characters mostly including co-writer Bart Peeters perform sketches often variations on a sometimes long-running theme usually in the Dutch dialect of Antwerp. There are no taboos logic is frequently ignored or perverted and nearly all (especially recurring) characters are ridiculous to daft sometimes rather gross.
