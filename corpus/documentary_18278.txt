This remarkable award winning film traces the history of the infamous Wonthaggi State Coal mine. It was arguably the most dangerous mine in Australia and produced the strongest union. The film combines rare archive footage with inspiring interviews from some of the men and women that embodied the unique Wonthaggi spirit. It is a story of mate ship and community determination. From the first shafts hastily sunk in 1909 to the last whistle in 1968 Wonthaggi was a place of danger and industrial turmoil. Bent over with picks and shovels working in a narrow and dangerous coal face the Wonthaggi miners knew that disaster always lurked in the darkness. But the brutal nature of the work bred a solidarity that was both inspiring and truly unique. This small loyal band of brave men supported by their courageous women transformed the face of Australian working life forever.
