Washington Irving was the first true American-born celebrity of literary fame. His contributions to both short fiction and biography were unparalleled by his contemporaries. After creating unforgettable characters like Diedrich Knickerbocker Rip Van Winkle and Ichabod Crane Irving would go on to write "A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus." Once his appointment as U.S. Ambassador to Spain ended he retired to his beloved Sunnyside where he completed his five-volume "Life of George Washington" before his death. This "illustrated documentary" will cover Irving's life through a series of original pieces of artwork bringing to light the story of a man who transcended the era he was born into making his a life of extraordinary accomplishments.
