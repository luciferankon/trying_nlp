After years of being unhappy the tortured but kind-hearted Grim Reaper quits his job and becomes human. Now he's alive in NYC and still dealing with his egotistical father (God) his doting mom (Mother Nature) his mercurial twin brother Cupid and his bumbling best friend/grim reaper replacement Garrett. He wants to enjoy life and life has some lessons he'll learn the hard way.
