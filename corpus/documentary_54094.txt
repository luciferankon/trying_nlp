The new hope on Switzerland's pop horizon is called "Pegasus": the young quartet from Biel has just released its first CD with a major label. Before that however the four 18-year-olds had already had a path of trial and tribulation behind them. Simon Baumann and Andreas Pfiffner accompanied Pegasus for two years documenting their emotional roller coaster of highs and lows self-doubt crises success and growing recognition. In spite of the fact that stars are frequently 'made' on television nowadays their type is still around: musicians who write their own songs and view their music as a message to the listener. Four of these musicians perform in the leading roles of the film "Hope Music". They are approximately 18 years old and compose straightforward popular pop songs in a style akin to the 1960s. They have what it takes - states the unanimous voice in the press - to attain international success.
