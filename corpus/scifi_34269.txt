A transport operation goes woefully wrong during a thunderstorm. Coffins containing ancient corpses fall from the transport helicopter. After being struck by lightning and falling into a nuclear reactor the skeletons come to life. They find their way to a bar where they dance with a group of bar girls. Next they invade a fashion show attacking the models and the reviewers. They invade Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory and bring the Frankenstein monster back to life sending him to break up a socialite's party. The socialite however knocks out the Frankenstein monster in a fist fight. The skeletons stow away on an Air Force transport taking the Frankenstein monster along for the ride. They take a fighter aircraft and an antique WW2 German airplane for war games. Stepping up their game the skeletons take a spacecraft through a wormhole and kidnap an alien using it to scare a little girl and then crash a garden party where they kidnap three little girls turning them over to the alien Gort. Finally they find another bar where they dance the night away.
