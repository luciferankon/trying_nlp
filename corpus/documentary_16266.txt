El Immigrant (2015) is a 46-minute experimental documentary film that explores the experiences of visible minority immigrants in Canada upon their arrival and their (in)ability to integrate into society. The film combines autobiography with field interviews screen recordings and found footage (advertisements old documentaries YouTube how-to videos etc.) to create what the author calls a 'constructed dialogue': a technique of creating a conversational dialogue between people who would probably never meet or converse; the author however through the power of montage can introduce them to each other. The film uncovers themes of identity and how it relates to profession the politics of (in)visibility multiculturalism racism and 'linguistic terrorism'. The film is meant to be digressive associative and self-reflexive - unconventional qualities that would make the viewer always alert and uncomfortable (and thus questioning why they are feeling so).
