Stanislav - a successful and wealthy man living in a small town - can be hardly surprised by anything. He lives his lazy life in a way that corresponds to his status: beautiful woman near him no limits for wasting money drinking and doing lots of crazy things. Once being drunk he steals a car. After some drive the oldie is getting crashed. The car owner Elena came from Moscow to deliver lectures on ancient Slavic culture. By chance Stanislav attends one of her lectures.
