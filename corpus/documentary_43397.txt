There are people in this world who have a revolutionary spirit no matter what they do. Their field of excellence is irrelevant; their personality and generosity touch and transform many individuals on their way. The film is about such a man Moshe Khusid. His life journey from an extroverted post-modern theater director in Russia to an introverted Hasidic Jew in United States to a producer of an animated feature film is inspiring for all; especially for those who ever doubted that new beginnings were possible at any age.
