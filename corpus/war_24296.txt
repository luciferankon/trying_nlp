The story of two downed airmen one black fighter pilot from the 332nd fighter Group "The Tuskegees" the other a young RAF Bomb Aimer the sole survivor of a Lancaster crew in occupied Czechoslovakian territory in the few remaining weeks before the cessation of hostilities in May 1945. As they try to avoid capture by ill-disciplined German forces now in the throes of retreat an unlikely camaraderie grows between the descendant of a former slave of the Louisiana colonies and a well-educated young man from the British privileged upper classes as each one comes to rely upon the other for their survival. But what seems like friendship is something altogether more bizarre - a relationship that seems to transcend the place in which they both find themselves - and to even transcend time itself.
