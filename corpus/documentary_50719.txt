MUERTE ES VIDA (DEATH IS LIFE) - a documentary about the connection between life death and nature. Seven people from Canada to Mexico are each given a touch of hope by a visit from a Monarch butterfly at a time of loss. We meet these people and see how each have dealt with their loss and how something as small as a butterfly can change a moment the darkest moment in their life.
