Two enemy snipers stationed alone on different sides of a remote valley grow profoundly bored with war and trying to kill each other. Aggression cautiously give way for attraction and soon creative flirtation and courtship through sniper scopes across a 150 yard minefield escalates with a risky plan; to meet half way and consummate their platonic relationship. The scheme is discovered by a group of equally bored American journalists as well as higher-ranking officers on both sides who are not going to have a perfectly fine war reduced to a demoralizing one-night-stand. All parties come violently crashing together during the climactic last night - and consistent with the anti-war war-film-tradition only poetic justice will stand clearly victorious.
