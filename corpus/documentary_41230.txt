In Burkina Faso the lakeside Bazoule village is world famous for its unique tradition. For many generations the villagers have lived harmoniously with about 200 wild crocodiles. Crocodiles have remained the same for over 200 million years. They are feared and avoided by humans and animals alike. But the people of Bazoule revere the sacred crocodiles in the lake.
