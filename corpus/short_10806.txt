After two years of mourning Stanley Palmer is made redundant from his life in London. Depressed he travels to Mexico to scatter the ashes of his late wife and also hires a contract killer in a seedy bar to murder him at some unspecified time in the future. However almost immediately he meets and falls in love with Violetta which makes Stanley realize that his life has some meaning after all. When he goes back to the bar to cancel the contract he finds it not an easy thing to do - and there's no way he can get in touch with the killer.
