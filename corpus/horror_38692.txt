The story is about Samhain (Sow-in) a Pagan God worshiped by Celts and Druids two thousand years ago who appears today demanding Matt an ex-Catholic Priest give him a human sacrifice or he will take his son's life. Matt must go against the teachings of the church and accept there is another evil besides Satan. Matt is horrified by the gut wrenching thought of taking a human life to save his son before midnight on Halloween.
