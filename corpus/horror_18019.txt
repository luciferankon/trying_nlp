Jack Crowley who was the host of "Nightshade and Old Lace Theatre" as "Ferdy" sought sponsorship from Ferd Mattioli who took up the sponsorship. The show changed its name to "Ferdie's Inferno" with Crowley continuing as horror host "Ferdy". The show not only screened movies but also episode of Boris Karloff's Thriller. Carl Ames took over the role as "Ferdy" from 16 August 1968. When due to illness Ferd Mattioli moved to Arizona and Carl Ames also left the show came to an end. It would later have new life when Len Mattioli relaunched the show as "Lenny's Inferno" in 1969.
