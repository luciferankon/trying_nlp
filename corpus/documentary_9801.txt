Tells the story of the Si Tanka Wokiksuye; 'The Bigfoot Memorial Ride'. At first a small group but eventually 300 Lakota Sioux Indian horseback riders with support crews of hundreds more rode for two weeks through bitter sub-zero winter weather reverently praying and mourning over the lives lost exactly 100 years earlier at The Wounded Knee Massacre.
