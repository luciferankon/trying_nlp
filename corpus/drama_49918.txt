Sang-Woo (Lee Sang-Woo ) is a HIV positive 38-year-old man who lives in a small shed with his mother ( Lee Yong- Nyeo ). His mother at the age of 60 began working as a prostitute to support herself and her son out of their small shed. Meanwhile Sang-Woo works as her pimp - collecting payment and arranging appointments with his cellphone. Their clients include a paraplegic man and soldiers on holiday. Living through their difficult situation Sang-Woo still carries a strong bond with his mother. Sang-Woo also harbors intense anger within. His father (Kwon Bum-Taek ) abandoned them and then remarried into a seemingly normal family. But actually his father married a woman (Kim Ji-Hee ) who is a religious fanatic and their son (Jung Tae-Won ) always locks himself away in his room. Sang- Woo often meets their daughter (his step-sister) for drinks outside of a Buddhist temple. Can Sang-Woo ever find a way out for himself and his mother?
