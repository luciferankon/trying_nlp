The Channel 4 entertainment show which will be screened in October is billed as a format that will bring together "a host of talent from the world of music comedy TV film and sport as part of a 90-minute prime-time never-before-seen live entertainment show empowering the nation to feel nuts and talk bollocks!" Feeling Nuts has been developed in conjunction with the social movement Check One Two. The campaign was set up by two sets of brothers - Simon & Andrew Salter and Simon & Phil Tucker - after they heard the story of one mother's loss of her son to testicular cancer at the age of 19 due to embarrassment and lack of knowledge. Check One Two aims to empower men worldwide with the positive message about staying in regular check with their testicles.
