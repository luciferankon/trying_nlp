Pumpkin Moon is a magical half hour animated special. It tells the tale of a black cat who gets caught up in a Halloween battle between an army of good pumpkins and a hoard of evil witches and their spells. Set in the American mid-west in the 1950s it's a classic story of regeneration and the triumph of good over evil and at its centre is the special relationship between the cat and one of the pumpkins.
