The catastrophically dry weather of 1947 causes immense problems in the countryside. In the small village Klícov only farmers Hánek and Bervida and the old Hromádka have water. The others must queue every day for a drop for themselves and their cattle. All the villagers lament over their previous decision to turn down the cooperative chairman Kouba's proposal to built a new village water-supply system.
