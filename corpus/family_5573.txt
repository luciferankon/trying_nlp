Kid Talk was promoted as "family-friendly" programming in the early 1970's. Actually "Kid Talk" ran opposite ABC's "Juvenile Jury." Then programming by the only networks in that day NBC ABC and CBS made attempts to "recover" "family-programming" from the 1950's and the 1960's; however they tried to accomplish this by promoting the "kid's point-of-view" perhaps to attempt to divert the public's attention from the more important issues of the day. Ultimately neither "Kid Talk" nor "Juvenile Jury" fared well in ratings primarily due to the television viewers' other more obvious interests at that time (i.e. Watergate and Vietnam) and because in that day the opinion of "kids" truly was not welcome (unlike today then "kids" were seen and not heard and that carried-through to television programming); consequently both networks cancelled their respective "kid host" talk shows. It was not until a production hosted by Bill Cosby in the 2000's that the format reoriginated. (That series too did not fare well.) "Kid Talk" was a rare attempt by CBS to counter Sunday afternoon sports shows with original family-friendly programming. The show itself was a bit of a curio; the children who were the regulars interviewed major celebrities rather than the reverse (e.g. in one episode one panel member asked one actress whom I don't recall if she likes to fight with her children). One of "Kid Talk's" resident panelists 8-year-old Mona Tera (who was seen in the opening titles skipping around in silhouette to the jazzy flute theme song) became a minor celebrity herself; later in 1972 she made a cameo appearance on "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In." None of the other regulars made it big in show business after this show ended in September 1972 and Ms. Tera faded from the public eye as well.
