'Yesterday's tragedy is today's comedy.' Caffe 'Boomerang' is one of Belgrade's many cafes. Seemingly just a backdrop for our cast of crazy characters but in reality much more than that. It stoically puts up with its guests and their misguided efforts to control their own destinies until the very end when it too has had enough... Boomerng starts just after the chaos in Belgrade has stopped. Quiet has descended on the city for a change there is no war there are no bombings no natural disasters. Taking place during one frantic day in Belgrade "Boomerang" is the story of a group of likable losers who have nothing to lose. Theft drug dealing arms smuggling - these are the activities they have come to know as daily life. But now police and criminals communists and monarchists cocaine dealers and toilet keepers movie buffs taxi drivers and a 50 year-old femme fatale must all try to adapt to this newly reigning potentially boring time of peace. And so on this day they are falling in love getting married solving murder mysteries exploring new business ventures having children and even rising from the dead. All paths lead to Cafe Boomerang where this cast of disparate and dissolute characters converge and combust in a final delirious series of events which ready or not propels them into a new day. A high-speed dark comedy Boomerang is a slice-of-life served with plenty of laughs and a dash of bite.
