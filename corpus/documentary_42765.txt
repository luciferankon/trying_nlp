In the 1960s the peninsula of Zorrozaurre was the industrial center of the city of Bilbao. Nowadays the area is under an accelerated decline. Old factory buildings are now used by artists and creative companies: circus schools video games designers film companies theatre groups. And they also have a deadline in four years to dismantle and move to another place due to the urban transformation that is coming also to Zorrozaurre.
