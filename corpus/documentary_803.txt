Once upon a time there was a city that was neat and tidy and which was home to only 12 million people. Today however Cairo has a population estimated at 20 million. Garbage is piling up in the streets and the piles are growing. Everyone in Cairo has his or her views on garbage but nobody knows what to do about it. Italian garbage disposal operators are brought in to tackle the city's waste problems and to teach the city dwellers rational garbage habits. ťCairo GarbageŤ is a portrait of the city community seen through its garbage.
