Em Branco is a dance video that uses a documentary approach in a irreverent style to show the infinite possibilities of understanding art through contemporary dance. Based on different opinions built by the audience and the artist the life of a ballerina is depicted on an almost all white background so that viewers can create their own interpretations and stories.
