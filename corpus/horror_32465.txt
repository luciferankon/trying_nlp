On October 31 2008 the hit paranormal show "Mysterious Hauntings" held a contest at the infamous Bailey House. The rules were simple. Stay at the house for a week and win a grand prize. What happened at that house is still a mystery as 15 people have gone missing without a trance. The only evidence left were a couple of cameras used by one of the contestants.
