Gunslingers: A movie remake of the Howard Hughes' classic film "The Outlaws" written by actor and screenwriter Andrew C. Howard and produced by Blue Zoo Productions. Gunslingers takes the tale of the last days of Billy the Kid and places these events into an historical perspective (although certain aspects of the film contain more modernized themes; mainly from the aspect of music). While trying to stay true to the original film "The Outlaw" Gunslingers tries to portray real events in the lives of Billy the Kid aka Henry McCarty Doc Holliday and the lawman Pat Garrett.
