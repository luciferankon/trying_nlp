A run to freedom about the power of evasion and the beauty of indulging. Hyperscape is a martial arts dance film. Trickers breakers and free runners will go to the extreme to stop dancer Marco Gerris who has broken free. Is there any escape if freedom is an illusion? Hyperscape is part of Point Taken. This project consists of four dance films for which Dutch choreographers and film makers joined to write a film plan. Four teams were selected to receive production funding. The four films will premiere in December 2010 at Cinedans followed by a television broadcast by NTR.
