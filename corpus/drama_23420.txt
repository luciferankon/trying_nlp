Alex has hit a wall. Juggling a life as a cooking show host for cable TV and a single mother has left Alex feeling stale. So when her boss tells her that the show is in jeopardy due to low ratings she decides it's time to take it on the road and to try and reinvent herself. With no budget and no real plan she packs her bags for Adriatico in the Mediterranean (an area where she grew up). She persuades her despondent daughter Lucy to go along to help her shoot her new show. Lucy has no idea that the trip is not really about a cooking show but is more about revealing the secrets of Alex's family.
