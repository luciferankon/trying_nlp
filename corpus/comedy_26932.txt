The life of four close friends in their late thirties is about to change forever thanks to a data breach that releases the names of donors to a sperm bank with fraudulent business practices. They hardly even remember donating their sperm twenty-three years prior when they were just teenagers in need of some easy money. Throughout the series the imminent arrival of the children they may have fathered dramatically alters their lives but never their friendships.
