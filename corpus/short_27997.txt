The world as a plaything for a giantess from outer space. A Godzilla-imitation on the way to herself: the giantess from outer space in the streets of a big city fooling around producing destruction copulating with the Eiffel Tower. An orchestra of big feelings the melodrama defamed in infantile sounds and absurd costume in make-up-persiflage and grotesque body-art-performances.
