An off-beat street drama drawing us inside the various socio/sub-cultures that make up the periphery of urban Australia. The film centers on Blaze an aspiring musician who grows up in the working-class western suburbs of Melbourne. Warrior shadows Blaze and his colorful cohort of friends through a 15-year journey of triumph and agony. Little does Blaze or his motley group of friends know the choices they make while growing up begin to shape their destiny. The streets hit hard but they hit back!
