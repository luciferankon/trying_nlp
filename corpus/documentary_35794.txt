Oettli's film follows a cultural exchange program between actors from Burkina Faso and a Swiss director touring through both countries. The real dramatics take place off stage as individuals' expectations and reality don't tally and economic differences are all too apparent. Tempers fray and encounters ensue that no-one could have foreseen.
