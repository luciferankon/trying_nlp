Autrement (In another way) is a documentary that explores the region known as the "least developed" the world: West Africa. There is something extraordinary happening here: social groups and individuals who imagine other ways of thinking and acting. Is there an option to the dominant global model of development? Is it possible to do science differently? Can we create and innovate in places with limited financial and material resources? Scientists farmers teachers and students sociologists engineers doctors traditional and contemporary dancers raise their voice: We can do it in another way! Africa is alive dancing at their own pace and offers hope to other societies willing to wake up. Autrement is a "face to face" with Africa through inspiring projects: from workshops of DNA with kitchen products to acclaimed contemporary video-dance  coming through the sacred groves and other local initiatives that show this co-production in Mexico Benin Malaysia a reality of diversity colonization resistance and creation. Autrement is a story of conviction responsibility and freedom through a young Mexican scientific in West Africa. In this dynamic world it is important to ask questions differently at all levels. Autrement gives voice to other people in the forgotten countries those of West Africa a region that needs foreign aid and consumes foreign innovations. It is recognized as the recipient and rarely as a donor. Another role is possible for Africa and thus another role for developing countries and their citizens is also possible. Autrement puts into question the dominant systems that define our societies delineated by only a few while the rest of the world try to copy use or in the best case adapt rather than propose according to their own needs and context. Given this lack of vision an idea born of decolonization of unity and integration not confrontation and conflict prompting societies to act and create to dance at their own pace.
