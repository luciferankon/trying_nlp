Actress Irene Papas narrates this promotional short film advertising the upcoming action movie _The Guns of Navarone (1961)_ (qv) which was filmed on the Greek island of Rhodes. Gia Scala and Irene Papas were the only two women cast by 'Carl Foreman (I)' (qv) to star in "The Guns of Navarone". On their day off they look forward to wearing dresses and high heels again. The nearby town of Rhodes is a shoppers' paradise; almost everything is for sale duty-free. Traditional jewelry is handmade in dozens of back rooms all over the city. With young men graciously offering to carry their packages Gia and Irene also buy cloth shoes umbrellas furs dolls decorative plates and a large sea sponge for bathing. But it is soon back to work for the two stars. After spending so much time in the mud and dirt Irene is glad she bought that sponge!
