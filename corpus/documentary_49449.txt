In the country with the biggest police force in Europe Ukraine there is a lack of policemen in rural communities therefore villagers of Stara Zburievka village have found a solution. They chose two local men - the smartest and the strongest - to take care of the public order. Villagers give them power a car and shiny tokens and name them "sheriffs". Sometimes wild and violent the other times awkward and funny sheriffs' actions according to the village community are always fair. However the recent political events taking place in Ukraine have changed the situation in Stara Zburievka village too. Will the sheriffs' activities which started as a protest to the existing corrupted system be able to cope with the new complex and revolutionary transition? The "Ukrainian Sheriffs" is a kind funny and sometimes shocking story about average Ukrainians who take action and build their own let's say idealistic country model combining wildness and kindness immorality and humanity. It is a film that telling a story of one village tells a story about the whole country. A funny laughable and for the moments absurd story about common people taking action to built their own community life. In the light of Ukraine's revolutionary transition wildness and kindness crime and compassion are living hand by hand in a remote surrealistic town.
