Wolfgang is uninspired and contemplating suicide. The worldwide success of his video games have only made him more depressed and unfulfilled. Wolfgang's plan was to check into a Miami motel and take his own life but what he didn't account for was that his path would be forever altered when he meets another guest: a rebellious young working girl named Victoria Vix. She may have just given Wolfgang reason to extend his stay a few more days.
