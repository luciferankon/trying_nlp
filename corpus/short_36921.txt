On Top - Iceland a lighthouse a cold winter evening. Her thoughts drift back to that summer ... to bathing in the hot springs ... to when they first met ... and embraced. Down Under - Australia the desert a blistering heat wave. His pickup stops at an icehouse ... he lays the blocks neatly on the buckboard ... and drives off haunted by a aching memory. Without dialogue or comment save for verses from a sonnet by John Keats Fridrik Thor Fridriksson links the thoughts the emotions the sensual longing of young lovers at opposite ends of the world. A tone poem a collage of sight and sound. On Top is of course Iceland - in contrast to Down Under Australia. As the evening shadows fall over an isolated lighthouse a young girl recalls the joys of a past summer with her lover at a geyser. As the day wears on in the blazing desert the young man of her dreams transports blocks of ice to a lonely shack out in the bush. Somehow their fates are shared - much as in the last sonnet penned by the young John Keats.
