According to Buddhists hungry ghosts are the dead who cannot bid farewell to the living. They are a metaphor for spiritual hunger which we often try to satisfy by chasing the superficial and material. This directing debut by Michael Imperioli is filled with hungry ghosts. A group of New Yorkers of different ages races and backgrounds hunger for emotional sensual and spiritual fulfillment. Their intersecting and colliding paths reflect the zeitgeist of our times in which the desperation of the West smacks up against the religious teachings of the East.
