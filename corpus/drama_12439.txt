Illusions of beauty and violence surround us obscuring our understanding of space. A feeling of entrapment prevails as we move cautiously through circular rooms. We are listening. Technology is omnipresent and deceitful. We are uncertain in this setting. Impressions of reality emerge as we identify with romantic and irrational experiences. We are watching. A Spanish convict confides in us; drunk he loses consciousness on the roof of a parked car. Buildings of great decadence loom as the vehicle begins to travel through his streets. The radio antenna tunes-in to stories sublime fictions and intimate realities all present amidst the chaos of the city.
