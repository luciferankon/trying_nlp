Most of what we know about domestic violence has come from battered women in shelters. SHELTER tells the stories of 5 rural West Virginia women over a five year period as they try to find freedom justice and safety for themselves and their children. The documentary explores the history of an extraordinary grassroots movement that saved lives and also changed the way we think.
