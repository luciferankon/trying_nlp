Dr.Rao (Girih Karnad) is a Vetinary doc who comes to this village with the aim of starting a Milk Co-operative society for the welfare of the villagers.

How Dr.rao succeeds in his mission to make the villagers self reliant with the help of Bindu (Smit Patil) and Bhola (Naseeruddin shah) is worth watching.
