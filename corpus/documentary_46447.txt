As the engines of a rocket ignite three brave astronauts prepare to make their new home orbiting high above our Earth. The moon passes through our planet's shadow to become endowed with a mystifying red glow. Icy rocks form the appearance of rings as they surround Saturn like satellites. Far from our civilization the Curiosity rover traverses the surface of Mars. Space Suite returns with a new series of 10 short films that explore the infinite wonders of our universe and our interactions with the cosmos. Technology and art combine to show us a world invisible to our eyes hidden in the secret wavelengths of light along with the skies that inspired the artists of the past to create a visual splendor of images painted on rock and canvas. Accompanying the stories told by the stars are melodic pieces of classical music that include Tchaikovsky's "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"; Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21 in C Major; and Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony Mvt One.
