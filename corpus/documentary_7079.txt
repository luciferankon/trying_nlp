Pierre Rehov's latest film "The Path To Darkness" has led him to investigate those mythologies and takes us to Japan to meet with WW2 former kamikazes to Iraq where he was embedded in the U.S. Army's 4th Cavalry into Gaza and the West Bank. And for the first time he documents the step by step religious brainwashing of a candidate to suicide-terrorism including the rituals preceding his criminal act and much more. Rehov also has close encounters with families of suicide killers and local Imams. Following the acclaimed "Suicide Killers" "The Path to Darkness" will take you on a journey deeper into the mind of terrorists while debunking the dangerous mythologies propagated among our new generations. Billions have been invested by Saudi Arabia in U.S. universities in the last years. At the same time our western values have been eroded by moral relativism. This leads an entire generation to believe in new mythologies such as: a genocide is perpetrated against Palestinians; Suicide Killers are kamikazes or freedom fighters;Cho Eric and Dylan the murderers of Virginia Tech and Columbine are a typical product of our repressive society; the U.S. army is an occupation force in Iraq and many other relativist revisions of history leading to the path to darkness.
