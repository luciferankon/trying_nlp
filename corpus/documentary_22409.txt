Patrick Dougherty is an American Sculptor who creates his work one stone and one twig at a time. His whimsical pieces come to life often with the help of dozens of volunteers who lend their hands collecting the necessary sculpting materials from nearby fields and interlacing those materials to form the artist's vision. The Frederik Meijer Gardens and Sculpture Park commissioned Patrick for an indoor exhibition entitled Stir Crazy in 2007. The exhibition at the Meijer Gardens would be the second for the artist. Installation began on a snowy January morning and was completed 2.5 weeks later. Like most of Patrick's projects Stir Crazy remained in place for 6 months at which time it was dismantled never to be seen again. This video follows the creation of Stir Crazy from the ground up... literally.
