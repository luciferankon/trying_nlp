Young automotive safety advocate Tommy Tucker is delighted to find himself transported to the ethereal Safety Island-which Tommy learned about from performing in his school's safety pageant-after being hit by a car. The Safety Patrol there tell him all about automotive safety and the "careless gnome-skulls" who cause car accidents while his parents are waiting to see if Tommy survives emergency surgery. Will Tommy choose to die and remain on Safety Island?
