For Ned and Carl Christmas is a bitter time of the year. Five years ago their brother Frank died in a terrible snowplowing accident - an accident for which they both blame each other. Since then their feud has ripped apart the family plowing business and the family itself. Carl's wife left him for another man and Ned has retreated into bitterness. Frank's son Frank Jr. believes it is his mission to bring his warring uncles back together and save the family. He has no idea what he has in store for him. It's Christmas Eve and the brothers are at it again squabbling and using their snowplows as battering rams against each other. They don't realize that the town's deputy is walking up on the scene to have a word with them. A sudden reverse and a heavy thump later the brothers have a body on their hands. If that's not bad enough on closer inspection they realize that this is not just any cop this is Carl's rival-- his ex-wife's new boyfriend. They know that if they turn themselves in Carl will undoubtedly spend the rest of his life in prison. But can two bickering brothers set aside their differences to join in a Christmas caper? And what will two brothers do with a body anyway? Can Frank Jr. come up with a plan to get them off the hook or will his involvement of an ex-con only make things worse? This rollicking dark comedy explores the true spirit of the Holiday Season and the lengths that family will go for one another-- even if it means covering up murder.
