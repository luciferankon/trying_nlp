The Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (NCN) of Manitoba is re-inventing its relationship with the non-Aboriginal community in ways that have rarely been seen anywhere else in the world. This is inspired by the community's desire for economic self-sufficiency and is evident in a bold move by this Indigenous community to partner with one of the largest public utilities in North America (Manitoba Hydro) in order to jointly build a hydroelectric power project on traditional NCN land.
