A Shadow of Doubt is a documentary by The Graf Boys on 1080 poison and the effects it is having on New Zealand. Mixed in an attractive food this deadly pesticide is dropped from helicopters directly across our forests and waterways killing not only targeted species like possums and rats but also many native and non-native animals insects and birds. This is a non-profit project that demonstrates the "in-the-field" dangers of using aerially applied 1080 poison in New Zealand.
