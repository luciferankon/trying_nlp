On October 12 1967 combat photographer Cpl. William T. Perkins Jr. made the ultimate sacrifice when he hurled himself upon an enemy hand grenade to save the lives of his fellow Marines. Thirty years later his friend Craig Ingraham set out on a journey to discover what happened that day in the Hai Lang forest of Vietnam and along the way he discovered so much more. Bill Perkins Jr. is the only combat photographer in our nation's history so far to receive the Medal of Honor our nation's highest award for valor.
