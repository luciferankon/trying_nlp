A Frontier Conversation documents a unique collaboration between Indigenous and white historians from Australia and North America. In September 2004 a diverse group traveled through the Top End of Australia meeting representatives of the traditional landowners and engaging in a dialogue about Indigenous history. The themes that emerged raised more questions than answers - from cultural appropriation and copyright to land rights the role of language and art and what history means to Indigenous communities in the current climate of cultural reclamation and survival. Narrated by Professor Ann McGrath Director of the Australian Center for Indigenous History at the Australian National University it is a fascinating and thought-provoking account of a journey that breaks away from "the History Wars" and signals the first step in a new approach to the study of frontier history.
