Rodeo cowboys represent the last vestiges of a world that's slipping away. From a history that forged its trails of courage and freedom across the North American West theirs is a story of trust and undying camaraderie. It's a life of a hundred thousand miles a year of dust and songs on faded radios of little financial gain. And it's a life of competing eight seconds at a time not against each other but against themselves. Over a hundred years the the traditions and values have never changed. It will always be men and women living their dream of the open west chasing victory becoming champions. Featuring the world's greatest cowboys from Tuff Hedeman to Miles Hare narrated and co-written by Jordie Thompson Moon of the Desperados is a poetic journey through the lives of every cowboy who's ever traveled the long road. It's a visual tribute to a whole way of life with all its color and desire
