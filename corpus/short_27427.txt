In 1933 a policeman have to bring back a prisoner from Senneterre in Abittibi to Montreal in the south of the province of Quebec. He soon find out that his prisoner who's supposed to be a young man is in fact a pretty young girl. It's just before Christmas in 1933. Hervé a newly minted Montréal based member of the Québec Provincial Police force has just been given his first assignment: to pick up Claude Lachance a seventeen year old prisoner from a little town outside of Senneterre in western Québec and bring Lachance back to Montréal. Before arriving at the local jail where Lachance is being housed Hervé has not read Lanchance's file. He is surprised to find that Lachance is an innocent looking girl who the local policeman says is not to be trusted and who must be handcuffed at all times on the trip to Montréal. Waiting for the delayed train at Senneterre to travel back to Montréal on Christmas Eve Hervé learns directly from Claude that her sole crime is that she is an orphanage runaway. Hervé's Christmas Eve and Christmas with Claude makes him reexamine his life.
