In a lost village in the Peruvian Andes a young girl is waiting for the new books to arrive. They are carried in a rucksack by a librarian walking in the mountains between the sky and the clouds. Rural libraries in Peru are made up of a few dozen books that once read are exchanged for others between communities. Books walk as people walk.
