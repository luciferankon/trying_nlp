The series pits five couples each from different states to compete against each other in opening a successful restaurant. In the early episodes of this show the couples are given a vacant restaurant space in their home city that must be renovated. They compete for additional money that can be used for renovation from a panel of judges based on a presentation of their mission statement and plan for their proposed restaurant. After a number of weeks the elimination process begins. The restaurants (and their owners) are reviewed and judged for nomination after a short run in which they were opened to the public. The nominated restaurants then compete for votes from a phone poll with the victor moving on and the loser being forced to shut down. This process continues until a single competing restaurant remains.
