Anthem is a film that explores the fundamental question "What is an American?" Anthem presents a personal view of how American's see themselves and how a single comment "I'm moving to France" can come to stand for the greater dream of acceptance and self-worth. Filmed on location in College Station and McKinney Texas as well as Paris and Normandy France.
