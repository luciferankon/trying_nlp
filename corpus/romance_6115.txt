The approximate twelve hours in the lives of Montreal-based artist Manny Stephanopoulos and Toronto-based photographer Alex Smith following their initial meeting is presented. That meeting takes place on the sidewalk just down the street from Manny's apartment as Alex asks him for directions to her hotel she visiting Montreal for the first time and thus unfamiliar with the city. Based on that chance encounter Manny asks Alex up to his apartment for a drink she cautiously accepting. Thus initiates the process of them possibly getting to know each other in all that entails. At each stage along the process there may be high times and low times with a question being whether the high times are high enough to overcome or sustain the low times especially in the early stages when they hardly know each other. Through that process Manny is more open in his attraction to her with she having the power to leave and/or return anytime she wants as she knows where he lives he not knowing the same about her beyond the general locale of the hotel where she is staying. However this phase of their joint lives has an imminent end point as Alex is scheduled to head back to Toronto on the train first thing the following morning with subsequent questions being whether there is a future for them after they part company and if so what form that may take. Alexis and Manny are a "12-hour" couple whose turbulent love affair is told over the course of a half-day. Their romance begins with a chance meeting on the street then is fast-forwarded to Manny's apartment where they spend an unforgettable one-night stand together that feels like a lifetime. They say time stops when you meet the love of your life. Unfortunately Alexis and Manny have only 11 hours and 54 minutes left to go.
