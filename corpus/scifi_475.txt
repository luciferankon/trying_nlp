Set in 4671 a century after the events of Colony Wars. In the canonical ending the League of Free Worlds successfully fights the Earth Empire's Colonial Navy into a last stand in the Sol system where the Navy surprisingly holds their ground. The League pulls out all forces from the system and closes the warp hole cutting Sol off from the universe. Now devoid of access to fresh resources as a result of the closure the Empire degrades into civil war over the succeeding decades. Only the appearance of a man named Kron and his brand of anti-League propaganda somehow keeps the Empire together.
