Valinteno is a popular casting manager for models who's about to go to war with a secret society for working with models they did not approve of. Valinteno received his own T.V. show from the same group of people that wanted him dead. His goal was to have a productive modeling agency even after his death. By going against the powers that be in an industry where extortion rape and violence is mandatory Valinteno risks his life helping models become successful not knowing that one of his models was being extorted by the secret society. Can Valinteno's dreams come true by being the greatest casting manager ever and having a productive modeling agency even after his death?
