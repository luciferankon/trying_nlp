After a series of unfortunate events he proves to be a bad luck magnet as he was restrained to get near his son Miko; this after he became violent in a bar owned by his wife and her ex-suitor Brian (Ryan Eigenmann). Macario his closeted high-school best friend enters the picture in literally gay fashion as Kylie (Keempee de Leon) to the rescue.
