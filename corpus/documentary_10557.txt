Earlham College students go on a journey to the lands of Nicaragua Israel and Palestine to find the commonalities between young people working for peace and understanding in areas of conflict and post-conflict. After various testimonies from war survivors the movie focuses primarily on Wilmer's own country's experience in re-building peace after a devastating conflict and it is then compared with the situation of two young students in the Middle East. Breath of Peace is the proof that understanding and tolerance are still possible in the world.
