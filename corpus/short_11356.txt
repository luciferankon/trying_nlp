The piece is inspired by Emma Jung notion of the "Amandus": "The Amandus lures the girl into his house gives her wine to drink and afterwards takes her into the underground (psyche) to kill her. As he prepares himself for this a sort of intoxication overcomes the girl. In a sudden impulse of love she embraces the murderer who is immediately robbed of his power and dissolves after promising to stand by her side in the future a helpful spirit." Both rest in harmony in the bed of the unconscious. Then it evolved to the idea of the unconscious mind. The unconscious mind is still viewed by many psychological scientists as the shadow of a ''real'' conscious mind though there now exists substantial evidence that the unconscious is not identifiably less flexible complex controlling deliberative or action-oriented than is its counterpart. Actions of an unconscious mind precede the arrival of a conscious mind-that action precedes reflection.
