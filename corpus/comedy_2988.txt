A new reality show GAME OF THE YEAR is looking for the greatest warriors of role-play gaming to award the most epic bounty a gamer can imagine running a game company for an entire year! Only one group in the country can win it all so when Richard and his lifelong friends and fellow gamers decide to heed the call they agree to have their lives filmed prior to the auditions to better exemplify to the show's producers just how mighty their skills and solidarity truly are. But as the documentary keeps filming cracks in the group's armor begin to show. Like John's fights with his wife over the game. And Kyle's constant hope that his girlfriend never finds out what really happens at his weekly "poker game". And Mark's shy geekery. And Billy... being Billy. When Richard and Shawn end up at odds over the affections of Jennifer the sound girl on the documentary tensions finally snap and the group finds itself battling something more frightening than any tabletop orc or wizard: each other. Can our heroes get it together before the big audition at the local gaming convention or will they suffer a critical fail that will end their friendships forever?
