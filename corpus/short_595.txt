Is church a specific place where individuals gather once a week to sing a few songs and listen to someone talk about God or does church refer to the people themselves who share a common mission in the world? Maybe if we start to view church the way God designed it as a family loving each other and living and sharing all of life together we might show the world a glimpse of who God is and we might begin to impact the world as God intended us to do. 'Fellowship' is the fourth film in the BASIC series.
