LOST ON THE BOHEMIAN ROAD A Sean Hoessli Trip "not your ordinary boy meets girl meets girl love story" LOST ON THE BOHEMIAN ROAD is a sensual yet comical love triangle between irresponsible drug-loving photographer Ian his sharp-tongued bisexual (ex) girlfriend Amy and 16-year-old innocent Heather. LOST ON THE BOHEMIAN ROAD realistically portrays a 90's generation that is in search of more than traditional comfortable answers of yesterday. If one has ever felt the alienation of a changing society or the growing pains of innocence lost in a time of reckless experience it's time to hit the bohemian road. Starring Eric Zudak Kate Peckham and Terri Heffron Featuring Music by Mustard Plug Karmic Rollerball and Spurge Produced Written and Directed by Sean Hoessli Premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival and on the Sundance Channel
