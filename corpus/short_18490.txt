Nestled on the outskirts of the tiny community of St. Agatha Ontario lies the Carmel of St. Joseph the home of a cloistered contemplative community of Carmelite Nuns. They observe their vows of poverty chastity and obedience in joy and direct their lives toward prayer and the contemplation of the things of God. In this half-hour special Salt + Light Television takes you behind the cloister in order to spend the day with the Carmelite Sisters.
