When the United States finally conquers Canada by "asking nicely" Dale is thrown into the job of American presidency thanks to the machinations of the shadowy Hangelberg Group. However when this simple puppet turns out to be harder to control than they first thought sinister "measures" must be taken. Dale MacDonald - a not particularly bright ice technician from the northern resort village of Chilly Beach - is chosen to become the puppet president of the United States thanks to the machinations of the shadowy Hangelberg Group and its money-obsessed chairman known only as The Baron. But when he discovers that The Baron's overarching goal is to hostilely take over his native Canada doofus Dale must devise a plan to stop them. He enlists the help of his genius friend Frank and a handful of local yokels to sabotage the Hangelbergs' plan to insert satellite-controlled microchips into every Canadian literally turning them into mindless 'shopaholics'. This full-length animated film uses satire and slapstick - as well as a strong story arc with plenty of action and intrigue - to humorously skewer the keystone of Canadian identity: our sometimes uneasy relationship with Uncle Sam.
