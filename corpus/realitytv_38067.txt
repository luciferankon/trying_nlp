Sean "Diddy" Combs and reality television visionary Mark Burnett have joined forces to produce P. Diddy's StarMaker - an innovative performance elimination show that brings together under the same roof the best elements of reality television: the explosive reality of young talent desperate to become stars and fierce onstage competition. It's the only show that lets viewers peek past the curtain and see the real life drama behind the scenes as seven guys and seven girls battle it out for a superstar opportunity of a lifetime.
