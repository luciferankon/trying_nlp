One hundred fifty years after the Civil War the focus on Civil War history is alive and well in Iowa. Reenactors gather and set up camps. Spectators flock to the events and watch waves of soldiers march across green fields to attack the enemy. Horses gallop about and artillery thunders as living historians portray battle scenarios to the delight of enthusiastic crowds. These events also offer a wide array of other activities... visitors may be able to enjoy live music and entertainment typical of the Civil War era or attend a Saturday night dance or a Ladies Tea or a presentation by Abraham Lincoln. Each event becomes a unique opportunity to reconnect to history... and have fun!
