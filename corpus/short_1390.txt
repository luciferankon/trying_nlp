Follow Me is a quirky short film about a girl who decides to stalk her best friend's stalker. When Emily learns that a boy named Grover has been following her friend and roommate Melissa around - she decides to confront him. She's taken for a loop when he convinces her that an invented relationship may be the best kind of all: no fighting no problems just (imaginary!) bliss. So what if it's not real? "It's real to me" Grover tells Emily - and she sees his point. After that she can't help but tease Grover - popping up every time he's trying to watch Melissa. But can she convince him to follow her instead?
