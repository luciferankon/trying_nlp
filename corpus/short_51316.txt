The Writer's life is tied intricately to his typewriter: he has aged with it created stories for years on end with it repaired it and tended to it and now alone with his thoughts he writes his next film. He starts to struggle though hitting a creative block and he seeks ways to push through it. Looking for inspiration around him he presses forward with his work but the harsh punctuating sound of a leaking sprinkler behind him leads to a terrifying realisation. - What he types seems to actually happen and unable to stop his hands he starts to dread whether he is a creator willing other worlds into being or a character with no real choice at all.
