BBC Young Dancer 2015 is a brand new award for young people that showcases the very best of young British dance talent. Young dancers enter in one of four categories of dance: ballet contemporary hip hop and South Asian dance. BBC Young Dancer 2015 culminates in a grand final at Sadler's Wells when the best dancers in each category will dance against each other for the title.
