Crime always pays - with big laughs in this clever series of rambunctious animated shorts. Shifty (The Criminal) a pint-sized pilferer with lofty ambitions and limited brainpower perpetrates crimes from the sublime to the ridiculous - and never quite pulls them off resulting in hilarious consequences. Rendered in a graphic style reminiscent of classic UPA shorts the action is nothing short of... arresting!
