The world used to resemble a ring-like island and it was here that a man's (Yanbing Hao) wife went missing. For eight years he imprisoned himself in a big red van waiting for her return. During this time he would drive to the highway everyday where lots of accidents happened. He made it his responsibility to pick up people who got stuck there in his red van. It was also where he met Meimei and fell in love with her. Meimei was a special girl who was born with a special 'gift' from God but went through pure severe physical pains all over her body everyday. She discovered that Hao's red van held a magic power which soothed her pains. Meimei had been adopted by an old man (Uncle Da) and in return helped him run a factory that repaired cars. The old man secretly loved Meimei but there he had an even bigger secret.
