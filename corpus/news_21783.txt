XFINITY Latino Entertainment Channel is an exclusive interactive channel for Comcast customers that for the first time integrates programming with a bound Enhanced TV Binary Interchange Format (EBIF) application that enables customers to immediately navigate and directly access On Demand content tune directly to channels order content upgrade packages or access menu items while an on-camera host talks about the available content. The TV environment has never before had a similarly combined environment where the TV viewer is notified of new content right away and then can navigate to this content from the same screen. Viewers simply use their remote control to activate a link or button that appears on the video screen related to the content they are watching. The buttons are embedded on the video signal and a data stream hidden in the signal is updated every few seconds communicating instructions to the set top box. This data is designed to work with most existing set top boxes and required no special new equipment to be deployed. The concept took an existing STB capability and repurposed it with a new code language that tied the customer to the assets with a direct link versus needing to use the set top box guide.
