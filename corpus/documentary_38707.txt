Hosted by NBA 2-year veteran LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers this is the third installment of the Battleground series. This season teams instead of individuals from two big cities in the U.S. play against each other to project which city produced the best team in the country. Illinois native Andre Iguodala of the Philadelphia 76ers assembles the team from Chicago and New York native Ben Gordon of the Chicago Bulls assembles the team from New York. Rap artist T.I. sings the theme song after the finals in Perkins Park in Akron Ohio LeBron's hometown.
