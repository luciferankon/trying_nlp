'Lokalplan 219' is the nickname for an abandoned empty field in Gentofte Denmark. Just a few meters next to 'Lokalplan 219' lies a major noisy highway which makes it quite impossibly for anyone to live there. Nevertheless Gentofte Kommune plans to build a block of houses (entended for immigrants) on the field. Gentofte is one of the richiest places to live in Denmark and houses some of the most conservative politicians. Even the mayor of Gentofte thinks it's a marvelous idea to put the immigrants there.
