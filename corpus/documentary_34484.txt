URINE AID is a rare look into the controversial world of urine therapy. With documentation dating back to the ancient Egyptian Eber's papyrus in 3000BC urine therapy is one of the oldest forms of health care. Both fascinating and taboo this documentary explores the confronting subject of drinking urine for medicinal purposes. Is the world of urine therapy just filled with strange eccentrics or does it hold the key to a better understanding of holistic wellness? In URINE AID we hear from real life survivors who have healed themselves of some of the most serious of illnesses such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis solely with the practice of urine therapy. We also hear from highly regarded professionals in both modern and alternative medical fields from around the world who practice this therapy and share their research in a global collective network. Although urine therapy is discredited by modern medicine URINE AID questions the commercial use of urea by cosmetics and pharmaceutical companies. This key ingredient is a by-product of urine which is used in a range of medications and beauty products. Does this global multi billion dollar industry already reap the rewards of urine therapy? By delving into topics such as religion art culture and war URINE AID exposes the prevalence of urine use in every day society and challenges viewers to question their own belief system around the use of urine in medicine and alternative therapies today.
