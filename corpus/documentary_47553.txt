This documentary project builds on shared experience before venturing into issues of contention. It presumes that political exchange compromise and reconciliation can be wrested from bitterness and enmity especially when such hostility derives from things we don't know about others we don't trust. Dinner in the No-Go's seeks to promote mutual understanding and peace putting humor irony and just a little dash of absurdity into every bite.
