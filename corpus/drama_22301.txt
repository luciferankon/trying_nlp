The film 'The Salamander' responds to the need of instating a discourse a poetics. It is the need to create a stage on which my own perceptions and observations are expressed through the means of fiction. So this film finally exposes hints of my existence my evolution as a human being and an author a fresco on which to express a philosophical theory as in an autobiography.
