This is the story of how the WHO clings to their outdated theory's of how HIV is spreading in Africa. The case study the filmmaker picked is very dramatic. It deals with 5 Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who were given the death penalty by the man who was considered the world's greatest terrorist prior to 9/11 Colonel Kaddafi. It's the story of how HIV is spreading in Africa due to lack of proper medical equipment. In this case proper medical equipment was provided during the trade embargo against Libya but Col. Kaddafi sold it in order to maintain his life of luxury.
