Wild Sunflowers chronicles the story of Bobby Hatcher a Florida National Guard soldier from a poor rural farming community. His Company is deployed to Iraq where he is wounded in combat. He returns home to his family with severe PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and a physical wound that he received from an IED (Improvised Explosive Device). There is no local support to help him deal with his mental disorder and his physical wound. He is getting the bureaucrat run around from a Veterans system that is not working. His wife Molly Hatcher works in a local farm equipment parts supply store. Bobby is not capable of holding down a job due to his war wounds. He has frequent 'flash-backs' and is tormented with pain from his injury. He has become a pain pill addict. It's election year and Wes Van Hoevan is running for the local Congressional seat which has been held for twelve years by Ed Sutil. Wes is much more liberal than Ed and believes the troops should be brought home. This does not set well in the local conservative Congressional district. Now Molly must try to attain help for her husband through a 'broken' system while working and raising the children on her own. Bobby continues to get worse with continuous bouts of war memories and a growing addiction that has the family going into debt.
