Emily Bronte was born in England in 1818. Emily's only close friends were her brother Branwell and her sisters Charlotte and Anne. Emily began writing poems at an early age and published twenty-one of them together with poems by Anne and Charlotte. The slim volume only sold two copies and the failure led all three to begin work on novels: Emily on "Wuthering Heights" Charlotte on "Jane Eyre" and Anne on "Agnes Grey". Emily died of tuberculosis at the age of thirty and never knew the great success of her only novel "Wuthering Heights".
