Behind the closed doors of an open mind are decisions that people make for others. An abandoned girl child of a desert land grows in a nomadic culture. Her family is unaware of her inborn capacity to sing and slip in and out of parallel universes . Slowly her fame and flare to blend dance and lyrics spreads in the nearby lands. Slipping in and out of her retrospective tragic existence  her abandonment constantly haunts her. Far ahead of her times she acquires the ability to enthrall people. Late one night in a crowd of onlookers when she sings The Wrong Guy" the pain of her abandonment becomes relentless . A young boy in the audience deciphers that spiritual agony. Their bond is mutual and instant. "A love like this never like this". The boy realizes that her soul is bonded to wander creating illusion because her isolation has been so painful that he prays to the Lord to take her out of 'death disease and circumstance" So her soul is taken far above from the flames of desire to a higher realm and the planet earth becomes just a memory "Can You Hear Me." She is resurrected and there is clapping above. During this musical a strange echo constantly hums which is a symbol that the shutters of her life are closing fast and the reasons for living on planet earth getting slimmer. The Lord has listened her agony is over." Songs/Videos: 1. Can You Hear Me (Trance Mix) 2. The Wrong Guy (Club Mix) 3. The Wrong Guy (Studio Original Mix) 4. Hey Baby 5.
