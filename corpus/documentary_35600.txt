Five strangers before the 2013 Boston Marathon; five strangers who now share something linking them forever. At the precise moment when the first bomb exploded they were taking their final steps to the finish line. Now one year later they plan to return to Boston to race again where 3 people were killed and 264 injured - because they can't imagine not being there.
