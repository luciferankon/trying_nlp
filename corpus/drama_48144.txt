Yorkshire 1917. All the men in the isolated community of Ravensgill have left to join the allied fight in France. Their wives meanwhile remain behind to run the farms. At their disposal an internment camp of German POWs all too happy to offer up their services. Before long affairs have begun and in some cases lust blossoms into love. But underneath it all what these women have found is something far more powerful: independence. Sarah Rigg is the midwife and witch doctor at the heart of the village. She holds the power of life and death in her hands. So when the husbands return brutalized by war the women turn to Sarah to mix the potions that can save a life - or take it away.
