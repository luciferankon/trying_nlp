Free To Ride is the story of the relentless spirit of community leaders from across Dayton Ohio who overcame a suburban contingent fearfully opposed to the expansion of public transit along a commercial corridor and the system of checks and balances that allowed justice and reason to prevail. This modern-day Civil Rights saga began in 2009 when community members in Dayton Ohio became aware of the dangerous journey faced by bus riders walking from the last stop to get across a busy interstate overpass in order to make it to their workplace shopping medical and educational destinations along Pentagon Boulevard in the suburban community of Beavercreek. After the local transit authority had worked for nearly a year with Beavercreek's public works staff to develop a plan to add 3 new stops to the end of the route the process was stymied by concerned members of City Council and vocal residents. In the wake of City Council's vote to reject the application an Ohio legal aid group filed a complaint on behalf of the organized community members who supported the new bus stops kicking off a two year investigation by the Federal Highway Administration and a series of policy and publicity battles. As racial tension swells in the wake of controversial incidences between law enforcement and young black men Free To Ride is a promising story about how hard work collaboration and the accountability systems can yield fair and just outcomes for all.
