International best-selling author and media personality Rabbi Shmuley Boteach 'America's Rabbi' and world-renowned atheist and author Christopher Hitchens' in a hard-fought and electrifying debate on 'Is There An Afterlife?' The event hosted by This World: The Values Network (www.thisworld.us) was moderated by author and actress Lisa Oz. Shmuley and Hitchens took no prisoners as they fought it out over the meaning of life and whether life ends with the termination of the body. This was their fourth debate and by all accounts the most illuminating dynamic and memorable. A fantastic mix of intellectual rigor humor and spontaneity.
