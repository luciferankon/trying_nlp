A prison in Galilee is the setting for this film about a withdrawal and rehabilitation department for heavy drug addicts. The Last Chance is a powerful film that documents an all-too common social problem. It is also the compelling story of one man who will lose everything if he cannot find the strength to beat his addiction once and for all.
