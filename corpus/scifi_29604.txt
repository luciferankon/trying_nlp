As projected here a thinly-disguised NASA working with nuclear rockets is ready for manned flights in the mid-fifties...but Dr. Ralph Harrison doesn't think so and resigns in protest. Colleague Prof. Nordstrom promptly enlists his aid in developing an alternative robot Spaceman! Naturally foreign spies are keenly interested... Uses documentary footage of early space research. Dr. Harrison and Prof. Nordstrom develop the robot Tobor for space flight intending that he should be controlled by ESP. They announce their plans at a press conference which will spread the news worldwide then they become concerned that press conference security was breached because an extra person attended and they wouldn't want the information falling into the wrong hands! The extra person was a spy; he and his henchmen kidnap Nordstrom and his grandson but Nordstrom cleverly signals Tobor to charge to the rescue. The spies tear open the boy's shirt and threaten to use a blowtorch on him and the composition makes the torch appear to be pointed at the boy's temple while he concentrates on summoning his hero Tobor (the boy's father has been dead for several years but it looks like Harrison is striking up a relationship with his mother).
