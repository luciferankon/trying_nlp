Work may as well be the reason for New York City's existence. People from all corners of the country and the globe flock to Gotham to take advantage of the social physical and emotional mobility that it offers. More than any other factor the possibility to realize one's dream of doing what he wants to do is what New York has always held out to its pilgrims. Work In The Naked City is a documentary that explores what it means to be or want to be a part of this city a place that offers a gamble of possibly infinite rewards as well as broken dreams for anyone who is up for it. How do New Yorkers construct an identity in a landscape of such constant change? What is the emotional cost of living in the city? Do they consider themselves to be free? And what about its immigrants? How does its population feel about those who come from every country on earth to work and live in the city? Are they stealing jobs or doing jobs nobody else will take? And how on earth does such a disparate and uncommon blend of people manage to live and work together and attempt to forge a better tomorrow? What are the ingredients that each individual feels are the necessary ones for making the city work for us all? Nine years after 9/11 what can New York and the lived experience of its people teach us about unity (in a place of such immense diversity) and working for a better tomorrow?
