Director: "Just as I thought that I could finally put my feelings for my parents and my origins to rest my father decided to leave me his crumbling farmhouse. This stone inheritance is supposed to tie me again to the place where I grew up. It is supposed to bring me closer to my parents again. I have trouble breathing as I realise that my journey to understand my family has only just started."
