Fighting Back will bring you face-to-face with the unpleasant reality and disruptive consequences of a deeply disturbed young mind. A mind in adolescent turmoil; in rebellious conflict with society - unsure of it's direction it's purpose it's future. A destructive mind that wrecks havoc whichever way it turns. Young Paul Smith gives a remarkable performance as the trouble teen who finally gets peace in the relationship with his teacher. Great Australian film.
