WHILE I'M SINGING shows the daily life of a brave curious and eccentric troubadour in his insistence to win a dream. Juan María Pampín is a hairdresser but is defined as an artist and sculptor of human hair but his real passion is music. His persevering and ingenious humor and sharp conclusions about human existence set a vague boundary between the hilarious and the tragic life style. The director Julian Montero Ciancio raise the blinds of this barber's that goes far beyond the normal. Welcome to the party.
