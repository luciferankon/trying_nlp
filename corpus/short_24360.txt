Crabs in a Dollhouse is a short film showcasing the utterly surreal and private life of crabs. Our environment affects us daily either suppressing or liberating us as human beings. What happens when the threat of predators is gone and the tiny crab brain is left to find other means of occupying time? What situations will they put themselves in unaware of the consequences? Escaping death and obtaining food are major crab concerns so what of the crab without a care? Crabs in a Dollhouse is very much a social experiment that not only tests the crabs' perception and understanding of everyday life but ours as human beings as well. How closely will you relate to these seemingly meaningless bumbling creatures making their way through an environment very similar to our own? Will you understand their deceitfulness their pride their sorrow? Will you see them as a projection of yourself? In the end aren't we all just scuttling about in a frenzy confused and alone?
