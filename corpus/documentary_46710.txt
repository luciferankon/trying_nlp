Again waiting again a power failure and again the African artisans have not worked accurately - the filmmaker is tearing out his hair because he cannot understand why the development aid work feels like an idle cycle. His friend the Australian Brian Polkinghorne has been working in development aid for 35 years. He considers his work as being a "planter of ideas" - he who tries to plant ideas in the minds of the Africans. Ideas on how they can help themselves: for example the construction of a water tank or the construction of a pump made of wood and bicycle tubes. Brian defends the often incomprehensible actions of the locals to the filming visitor from Europe. The 76 year-old retiree emphasises the weaknesses of rich industrialised countries and condemns them all the more insistently.
