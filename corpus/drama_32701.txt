Human driftwood's basic premise is be nice to those who would want to do you in. The film opens with a wide view of the battlefield. It's present day WWI. The men of company 7 are in the trenches when the Camara focuses in on the hero Major Bungles who is sitting atop a pile of nerve gas bombs. "Have you ever seen corpses who done got themselves killed with the gas"? Their skin looks like wood. Their limbs are twisted and geotesque. Their faces have a horrible frozen grimace which once seen can never be forgotten. If you don't beleive me take a little walk with me and I'll show you the bodies that are floating down the stream. From afar they look like driftwood yeah human driftwood". The camara zooms in on Major Bungles blurs and fades to black.
