Set in a multi-cultural/religious suburban town "EK AAKASH" is an incident in the life of two boys RAHUL and ABBAS. Their playful kite flying session turns into a battle of one-up manship and lets loose a strange mixture of ego and aggression blinded by their emotions. They reach a point where they need each other's help.
