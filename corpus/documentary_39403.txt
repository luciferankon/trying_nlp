Filmed over the last six months of the 2000 Presidential election Phillip Seymour Hoffman starts documenting the campaign at the Republican and Democratic National Conventions but spends more time outside in the street protests and police actions than in the orchestrated conventions. Hoffman shows an obvious distaste for money politics and the conservative right. He looks seedier and more disillusioned the campaign progresses. Eventually Hoffman seems most energized by the Ralph Nader campaign as an alternative to the nearly indistinguishable major parties. The high point of the film are the comments by Barney Frank who says that marches and demonstrations are largely a waste of time and that the really effective political players such as the NRA and the AARP never bother with walk ins sit-ins shoot-ins or shuffles. In the interview with Jesse Jackson Hoffman is too flustered to ask all of his questions. The Party's Over follows Philip Seymour Hoffman as a concerned citizen on an uncensored journey of the state of democracy in America. The film examines how the American political process addresses and often fails to address the country's most pressing issues. As we countdown to the pivotal 2004 election the film answers the question is there a difference between Republicans and Democrats?
