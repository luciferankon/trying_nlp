Two little children a boy and a girl are playing at building houses with stones. While they are thus busily engaged a frog jumps out from the grass much to their amazement. They quickly jump up and try to catch the frog but he is too slippery and easily gets away. The action in this as in the companion pictures of this series is exceedingly natural.
