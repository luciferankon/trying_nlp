Based on a Rolling Stone article about real-life superheroes this new 30-min pilot centers on "Master Legend" a big-hearted self-identifying superhero who has dedicated to his life to defending justice and defeating wrongdoers on the mean streets of Las Vegas. Our hero seeks to reunite with his estranged wife and daughter but is torn by his all-consuming and earnest desire to help others in need using his homemade "Master Blaster" gun and hand to hand combat. An entirely new and unconventional spin on TV's superhero obsession Master Legend does not possess super powers or bulging muscles. He doesn't live in a lair or have a stunning love interest who doesn't know his real identity. This is the true story of a homeless man of very little means who is driven by the power of small meaningful acts of generosity and the belief in a better world.
