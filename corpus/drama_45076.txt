Based on a true story The Shoebox is a tale of tribute and redemption. After cancer claims the young lives of Shane Jones and Meghan Mack four aspiring song writers put aside their own personal ambitions to write a song in memory of these brave children and the thousands of others like them. Life's many obstacles challenge the men along the way testing their will fortitude and even their faith. Inspired by the emotional lyrics of his best friend Buddy (Armond Sindoni) K-Jack (Andrew Mitakedes) ships off to Nashville hoping to find the missing pieces to their opus. Along the way struggling song writers Jordan (Brian Razzino) and Jerry (Dave Zaidian) along with rock guru Raz (Brian Naughton) help K-Jack turn off-key cell phone messages and chicken-scratch lyrics into a heart breaking ballad. This teary eyed tale reminds all of us to count the blessings we have in our lives and cherish our family and friends. This one is "not about the money."
