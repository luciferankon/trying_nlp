In The Moment follows six high school improv teams on their journey to compete for the gold at the Canadian Improv Games. Told from the candid perspectives of the kids themselves at practices and team sleepovers the film captures what it's like to be a teenager today. Though the focus of the film is improv the National Tournament becomes a dramatic backdrop for the bigger story about modern kids and their families.
