The social portrait of a summer resort town of Kazimierz Dolny in 1930. Side by side there are townspeople and summer visitors: Poles Jews the intelligentsia artists local residents of all classes and the poor who respect every kind of work which is available. The title refers to the social class stratification: there's one moon for the privileged and the other moon for the poor.
