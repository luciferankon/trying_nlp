Zac and Mia based on the novel by A.J. Betts about 2 teens battling cancer in the same hospital. In the real world Zac and Mia would have pretty much nothing in common but in the hospital where they're the only 2 teens on the ward they develop an unbreakable bond. If cancer is the variable that changed everything the only constant is their ever-deepening need for one another.
