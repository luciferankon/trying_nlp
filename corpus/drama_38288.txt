Proxy to the People is a political feature film following Liam a depressed corporate/political videographer whose hot mic exposes a mayor's corruption. He is then encouraged to run for mayor himself but is only willing to run if he would have no individual power - Liam's plan is to use technology to allow the people to tell him directly what to do. He also believes the very idea of elected politicians is outdated inefficient and easily corrupted by money. In response to this attempt at returning power directly to the people and removing money from politics a large pharmaceutical corporation AnthraXana uses its "corporate personhood" to register a campaign of their own. They use their unlimited funding and every slick and manipulative tactic to try and crush Liam's campaign even nearly destroying his personal life. Liam's response is to give away all his campaign contributions using internet-based voting to determine which groups receive money. Who will win in the end? Will it even matter?
