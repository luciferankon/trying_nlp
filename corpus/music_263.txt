Jean-Michel Jarre in concert with his musicians at the London Docklands venue. The guest artists include guitarist Hank Marvin vocalists Mireille Pombo and Duke Bakewell dancer Setsuko Yamada and Turkish flautist Kudsi Erguner. The show also features The Young Women of Mali Choir and The Newham Academy of Music Choir. Mike Mansfield "Mr. Cue the Music" directs this dazzling pyrotechnic spectacular with equal energy to Jarre's music and even the rain drenching even special guest Princess Diana makes for a dramatic hour of music and views of Docklands under the incredible fireworks displays.
