In the little town of Herzsprung - whose name harks back to an ancient legend of broken hearts - almost nothing has changed since German unification except a rise in unemployment. Johanna a young mother and widow becomes one of the unemployed and lives on welfare. To make matters worse she falls in love with a dark-skinned roving adventurer and the whole village starts talking about it. Director Helke Misselwitz became internationally known for her documentary Winter Ad√© (1988) about women in the final years of the GDR. Herzsprung was her feature film debut. The lyrics for the song "Oh Your First Love" sung by Eva-Maria Hagen were adapted by singer-songwriter Wolf Biermann expelled from the GDR in 1976.
