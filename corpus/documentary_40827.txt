In a relaxed humorous atmosphere Simon presents a collection of artists at varying states of their professional journeys. Not necessarily famous but people who have been forced to make choices to follow the fire that drives them to eventually make a happy comfortable living from their chosen. The interviews will explore a list of themes all relevant to following one's dreams so that instead of looking at their achievements we explore the mechanics and individual psychology that got them there. It will explore artist's journey in finding a balance between artistic integrity and making a living or artistic integrity and being successful beyond their dreams. The troubles and tribulation of the artist within their family were they supportive? Society... is it supportive? Is it easier to be an artist in Australia or abroad? And if you were starting again what would you do differently?
