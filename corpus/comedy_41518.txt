Thomas Hartmann's 7th one man show is a mix of his usual nerdy comedy and curious observations combined with an uncharacteristically dark part of the show with his humorous take on his personal experiences with serious subjects like depression and suicide thoughts. This makes for a deeper and more morbid show than usual for Hartmann without loosing the element of comedy.
