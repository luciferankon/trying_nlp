The title of the film is Program: One Day - One Year - One Tide. A Brief Film About Time. This experimental short film created out of individual single digital photos does not tell a story. The camera looks at the North German mud flats a World Heritage site as if through a window with always the exact same view. The real drama takes place where nothing seems to happen: time passes unalterably.
