Marketing Department Manager Nam Jung-gi (Yoon Sang-hyun) is so nice that his colleagues call him "Father Theresa" and "Walking UNICEF". There is nothing that can ruffle Jung-gi's feathers but his coworker Ok Da-jung (Lee Yo-won) who is so nasty tempered she's been nicknamed "Fire Da-jung" and isn't impressed with Jung-gi's affable nature. In fact his goodness seems to bring out the worst in her fanning the flames of her fury at everything and everyone. Will Ok Da-jung finally push Nam Jung-gi over the edge and ignite his anger or will he eventually be the one to cool hers?
