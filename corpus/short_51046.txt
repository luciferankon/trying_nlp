Elizabeth Penashue is an elder from the Innu Nation of Labrador (Newfoundland Canada). For more than thirty years she has been a passionate activist for the preservation of her culture and the environment. Each March she leads members of her community on a three week trek across frozen rivers and mountains to the remote lakes region where she was born and raised. The walk is called Meshkanu which is the Innu word for "the good path." Elizabeth's walk is to raise awareness of the problems facing the Innu peoples and to make a statement to the Canadian government: "We are still here."
