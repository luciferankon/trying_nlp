A historical documentary set during the 2009 California Water Crisis which documents the plight of the farmer and the farm worker as they struggled to get access to water. Two California Central Valley farmers (George Delgado and Joe Del Bosque) who came from migrant farm workers and whose life's dream had been of being a farmer take a filmmaker (Juan Carlos Oseguera) around their impacted lands to document how water restrictions and environmental regulations since 1992 have threatened their way of life their American dream and their community--to the point that in order to protect an endangered fish species an environmental ruling--imposed by the Endangered Species Act--shut their water supply and they had to lay-off thousands of migrant farm workers which all together devastated their farming community. Because of that they felt they needed to act! On April 14 2009 farmers and farm workers along with a coalition of Latinos (lead by Latino comedian turned activist Paul Rodriguez) stage a water march across the heart of the California Central Valley to demand that these water restrictions be overturned and that their water supply be turned back on.... because to them and their migrant farming community water is not only their means of survival it is a chance of a better future for them and their families. This is a fight for survival... a FIGHT FOR WATER.
