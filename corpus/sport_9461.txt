The Stella Artois Grass Court Championships from Queen's Club London. The importance of this tournament is reflected in the entry with nearly all the top-ranked players taking the opportunity to adapt to grass courts under match conditions. Seeded to meet in the final are 'John McEnroe (I)' (qv)  the new WCT Champion and 'Jimmy Connors' (qv)  former _'Wimbledon' (1937)_ Champion. But with players like 'Vitas Gerulaitis' (qv)  'Arthur Ashe' (qv) and 'Roscoe Tanner' (qv) also in the draw no match is a foregone conclusion.
