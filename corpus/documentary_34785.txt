UNDIAGNOSED is the fascinating portrayal of a hidden epidemic of millions of people - men women children and families - who are suffering with medical illnesses yet are unable to find a diagnosis. These people whom our current medical system is failing to support live without a label or a categorization and worst of all no answers or paths to treatment. There are also no databases or cross-referencing mechanisms for their vital information. When an undiagnosed patient dies the chance for new medical discoveries that could save many future lives dies with them. In collaboration with Harvard Medical School Boston Children's Hospital and leading genetics and biomedical companies UNDIAGNOSED has launched a "Diagnostic Challenge" for the five patients whose plights the film has been documenting for the past three years. As the ailing hope for a miracle thirty prestigious teams of specialists from around the globe will study their cases in a race against time to solve these patients' diagnostic mysteries. By showing innovative ideas about how diagnosis and data allocation can be successfully done this documentary will bring to light this timely issue of a profoundly underestimated population and impact the future of medicine.
