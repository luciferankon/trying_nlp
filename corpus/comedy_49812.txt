NYC single mom and "realtor to the stars" wannabe Rita Wells is on the verge of closing her first multi-million-dollar deal. There's only one problem - her stepfather's death has pushed her neurotic controlling mother over the edge. Afraid to sleep alone in her enormous rent-controlled apartment on Central Park West Rita's mother badgers her relentlessly to move in. But when Rita's Dad finds toxic mold in his apartment Rita gets an idea. What if she convinces her parents to move back in together after 35 years of divorce? Even temporarily so she can get on with her already-crazy life and career and still hold on to the rent-controlled apartment of any New Yorker's dream?
