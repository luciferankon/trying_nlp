Bombay-bred Narain goes to a village where he meets and falls in love with a village belle Yashodra. She also is attracted to him and both get married. After their marriage both go to live with Narain's parents brother and sister-in-law Lalita and her son Sonu. Yashodra gets close to Sonu and starts to spend all her time with him. This raises some concerns with Lalita which results in some acrimony. Tragically Sonu passes away leaving Yashodra devastated and depressed. She gets pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl but cannot get Sonu out of her mind. Her depression gives way to insanity as she keeps on seeing Sonu in every child and as a result she is institutionalized. Narain has taken to alcohol in a big way and drowns his sorrows and frustrations day and night in a drunken stupor. As a result his daughter is adopted by Lalita and his brother without knowing who her real parents are. Years pass by her daughter Asha has grown up and is herself a mother of a baby boy and settled in the U.S.. Asha arrives in India for a visit and the entire family assembles to visit Yashodra. They find her holding a piece of log covered in a blanket singing to it as if it where Sonu. It is here that Asha finds out who her real parents are and it is here that she will be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice.
