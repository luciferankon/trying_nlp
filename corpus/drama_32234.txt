This film represents an attempt to build a bridge for a possible dialogue between religious faiths. The idea of a story embodying the search for a lost truth seemed to be an excellent pretext to speak about a historical fact which has yet to be fully recounted. As an author and director I have chosen to tell with "The Cross and the Star" the story of the concentration camp in Ferramonti di Tarsia (Italy) through the interior conflict of a priest in a historical period where integration and tolerance between religions is of the utmost and current social relevance.Through the fragility of Don Giulio seventyfive-year-old Catholic priest struggling with a truth thrown at him in the form of an old diary arriving from Haifa I imagined to interpret the feelings of many people who feel that they know themselves while they don't even know their own history.The conflict is even stronger when the man involved is a priest that has dedicated his entire life to God and the Catholic Church. Don Giulio who never heard of the concentration camp hidden away in Southern Italy feels compelled to investigate the past in the place where his presumed biological father was held prisoner along with another three-thousand Jews in Ferramonti. Re-writing history is a difficult task. But when it's your own life no truth must remain uncertain especially when the faith that saw you embrace the Cross of Christ so many years ago today walks parallel to that Star of a presumed Jewish father.
