On the morning of 31st December at a Belgrade market Spic and Djosa are selling baby pigs and Christmas trees. The European mad cow madness is doing harm to their profit mostly because Lister an upstart with shallow past is persuading people not to buy pork. The locals are waiting for a New Year's Eve with the sound of trumpets and popular songs of the past century.
