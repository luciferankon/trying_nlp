The decision don't sits well with Toni's parents Poppins and Rosa two ex-hippies that never married and that are the proud owners of a sex shop. Crazyness ensues and finally Toni and Maria end up married... and living in his parent's spare flat over the sex shop. Their over-sexed best friends Calafell (who's also the owner of the hotel Maria works at) and Rosa (Toni's fellow teacher) add to the general mayhem of their lives.
