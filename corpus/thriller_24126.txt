AT A TRAILER PARK IN THE WEST VIRGINIA WOODS RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARING. NOT THAT MANY WOULD NOTICE. LIFE IS HARD AND FOR CASSIDY ROGERS (30) IT CAN'T GET MUCH WORSE. SHE'S A WAR WIDOW TAKING CARE OF A 6-YEAR-OLD AUTISTIC BOY DUNCAN AND TODAY SHE'S JUST BEEN FIRED FROM HER LOW-PAY JOB AT A GROCERY STORE - FOR TRYING TO STEAL A COMIC BOOK FOR HER BOY. BUT HER FORTUNES SOON TURN GIVING HER HOPE. AN ECCENTRIC AND PARANOID NEIGHBOR BARRY NEUMANN (45) RECRUITS HER FOR HIS 'NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH' PROGRAM. WITH CAMERAS AND MOTION-SENSORS ALL AROUND THE PARK HIS PIMPED OUT MOBILE HOME HAS A CONTROL ROOM TO KEEP AN EYE ON EVERYTHING. BUT HE NEEDS AN ASSISTANT TO WATCH THE MONITORS WHILE HE'S ASLEEP.
