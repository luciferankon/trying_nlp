A Place in Time tells the life of a little town of one hundred residents lost in the mountains and doomed to vanish. The old man with his accordion the friend of the birds the man in the castle the only young man that hasn't left and the newcomer from the city they all develop together a choral narration that takes place during olive harvests butcherings of goats religious parades and a rather peculiar donkey race. The lack of water threatens their endeavors to keep on living from the land and their traditional way of life while an extravagant tourist project and the politicians' promises during the election campaign lead them to question their future.
