A trio of stories all centered on a holiday theme. Segment #1 'It's Beginning to Look Like Dagon' concerns three friends who decide to spend Christmas on a south Pacific Island only to find themselves somewhere else altogether. Segment #2 'Have a Hacking Whacking Christmas' involves an office Secret Santa gift exchange that threatens to go very very wrong. Segment #3 'Hark the Deathly Angel Sing' follows the story of a family that receives a very unexpected- and very unwelcome- visitor on Christmas Eve.
