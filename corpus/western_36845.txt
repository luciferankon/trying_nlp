Dan Hogan and his gang have held up a bank for $100000 in gold bars. They meet up at Jackal's Ranch a weigh station for stage coaches. While waiting for the gold to arrive they encounter a stranger John Webb who wants half the gold in exchange for guiding them safely to Mexico. Reluctantly Dan agrees and they set across the brutal desert for a race to the border with the Rangers hot on their tail. Is John who he says he is? Is he really after the gold or does he have an ulterior motive?
