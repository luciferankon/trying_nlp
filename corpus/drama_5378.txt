Three young families long-time friends see each other every day. They are all in their thirties and live together as one big family but the bonds between them gradually fray and their daily routines and fun times together are soon marked by confusion guilt and negativity. They have difficulties communicating with other people; the outside world seems strange to them or just does not stir their interest. They get together get drunk and discuss the meaning of this or that... They are infidel to their marital partners and then gather negative energy and feeling of guilt. None of them is satisfied with their life. They yield to their tempers every so often and swap partners but their new relationships do not bring joy and satisfaction to anyone. Annie is the only one to try putting an end to all lies fear and guilt. She dies in an accident and this triggers the breakdown of the vicious circle of sin and disgrace among people around her. Maybe her death will take them out of the spiritual torpor.
