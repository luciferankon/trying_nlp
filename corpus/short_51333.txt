The business woman's limited patience is immediately tested with help from a not so customer service oriented receptionist and her obvious reluctance to even be there. As things start getting weird our main character is pushed to her limit to point where she is literally on the verge of leaving. By exploring the quintessential British "tolerance" regarding waiting I focused on the internal conflict within the character. Strange occurrences further isolate the business woman pushing her until she starts to question her own sanity.
