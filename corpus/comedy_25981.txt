The show typically consists of JR directing the show on location usually in someone's house or a very odd / unique location. He then plays various clips of him doing comedy segments in various locations and also shows clips from his early years of trying to produce a television show. There are also dramatic comedy portions where we catch a glimpse at the behind the scenes world of television production and see well known actors and musicians speaking off-the-cuff. JR also likes to include a telemarketer call in the credits where he pulls pranks on the telemarketers that call him and tapes it on video.
