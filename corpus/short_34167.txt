Shortly after experiencing a 'significant' birthday and finding myself still single and worse disappointed by all my romantic partners I am suffering a crisis of faith. I decided to conduct interviews with a random group of people to discover if they believe in or better yet have found their soul mates. We found a few couples who were willing to share their true love stories with us perhaps renewing faith for us all.
