Elfi works in a printing company. On the assembly line she piles up brochures and when the mother calls on the mobile phone Elfi has to scream because the machines run so loud. Elfi is about fifty and shares with the mother a small apartment in the Lower Austrian province. After the end of the evening she cares for the old woman who always has desires and complaints but never has a good word for the daughter.
