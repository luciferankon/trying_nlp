In 2010 ASSA (American Science of Space Agency) designed a program to test the limits of the human mind in an isolated environment. The goal of the experiment was to discover what the mental toll would be for the crew of a manned mission to Mars. So a test was approved and in September of 2010 four volunteers stepped into a windowless carpeted basement in Cape Canaveral FL and were sealed inside for five hundred days of isolation. They were never seen again... This is their story.
