This film documents the life of the late Jewish historian and author Prof. Jacques Presser. Presser took fifteen years to write his book "Ashes in the Wind: The Destruction of Dutch Jewry" which created a storm of controversy because it exposed many members of the Dutch bourgeois who collaborated with the Nazis.
