Follows the lives of three unrelated teenagers as they run away from their respective homes each for different reasons. Arriving in Chicago one tries to make good with his life only to find it a little more difficult than he had imagined; one falls in with "the rock and roll set" and comes to a violent end; and one gets mixed up with prostitutes but comes good in the end. Shows things from both the parents' side and the kids' side. The underlying story is that you can't solve your problems on the road if you can't solve them at home.
