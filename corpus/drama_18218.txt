Powal is a boatman in Nemuguri village that is situated on the bank of the river Dihing. Since there is no bridge at that point of the river Powal's job is assured. For some three generations his forefathers have been ferrying people to and fro. Life goes on smoothly until Powal begins to hear persistent reports about a bridge to be built across the river.
