On a flight through the arctic the crew of a RAF airplane realizes a crashed soviet plane on the ice. There seems to be one survivor but landing is not possible at the moment. Finally someone decides to volunteer and gets out the airplane to stay with the Russian survivor until help comes. Both men wait for days but no help is in sight. They are on their own. Two different worlds two different cultures and two different men dash against each other and around them is only the cold.
