Armando Iannucci hosts the satirical debate that aims to squeeze the day's events into half an hour of various jokes clips and talk. Airing on every weeknight for only four days "Gash" is timed to coincide with the May 1st 2003 UK local government elections. Written and filmed on the day the show is intended to be as topical as possible.
