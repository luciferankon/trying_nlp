From Paradise to Fortune is a portrait of the Newfoundland government's rural resettlement programs. Exhaustively researched at the Provincial Archive in Newfoundland and the National Archive in Ottawa this film includes 16mm footage never previously transferred to video. In addition the film includes interviews with Ed Roberts Joseph Smallwood's Executive Assistant during the period and Dr. Parzival Copes the economist whose studies helped support and drive the programs during the 1960s and early 1970s. More than 20 abandoned communities were filmed across the island including images of intact houses cemeteries root cellars fishing stages and other remnants of these abandoned places. Several of the houses and structures have fallen since they were filmed. Most of these abandoned communities can only be reached by private boat and several require 2-3 days travel to reach. More than 25 people who were resettled or who resisted resettlement were interviewed. The film also includes a woman's return to her abandoned community after 40 years. Finally Newfoundland artists musicians and writers were interviewed contextualizing the resettlement programs and giving voice to the anger and outrage which found a voice in the younger generation of resettled families.
