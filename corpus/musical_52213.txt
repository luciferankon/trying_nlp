A young virgin named Mary is with child. According to ancient prophecy this child is the Jewish Lord incarnate and will be hailed as "King of the Jews". The jealous King Herod foresees this child's birth as his imminent removal from the throne. In his rage Herod orders that all babies born throughout Jerusalem be slain but Mary and the world's love for her child Jesus will see the young god protected through his infancy - ensuring he will fulfill all the prophecies laid before him.
