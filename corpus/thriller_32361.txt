You know how it goes - You and your friends get stuck trying to take a shortcut in front of an old house that looks barely habitable. You decide to knock on the door Mistake #1. Your gut tells you it might not be wise but you do it anyways. No answer but the doors unlocked. You decide to check the place out Mistake #2. You and your 4 friends should be able to handle whatever is on the other side at least that's what you tell yourself Mistake #3. As you poke around in the darkness the figure of an old man seems to come out of nowhere. You can tell just by looking at him that it's going to be a long night with more than a few mistakes still to come for Alsup Galt does not live alone in this house. Soon you'll meet the family..
