Dave Van Gogh was a 'starving actor' for thirteen-point-five years. After landing a contracted long-term commercial role as the face of Stay Strong Condoms he bought a house in an L.A. suburb and opened his doors to starving artists trying to make it in Hollywood. Now breaking into a new career path Dave started a management company WINNERS TALENT and represents each of his tenants as their manager and life coach. These tenants whom Dave calls his "Winners" include an array colorful characters: a lazy actor (Ty) a talentless pageant queen (Sophia) an awkward comedienne (Liz) an aspiring Sci Fi writer/blogger (Nathan) and a "slash" (Porter). The series follows these characters as they try to make it in Los Angeles and how they interact as room-mates.
