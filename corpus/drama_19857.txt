The screenplay is based on real events which took place in the town of Ohrid towards the end of the Second World War. A retreating German military unit has brought along a group of 25 Bulgarian prisoners of war. With the assistance of the local people the Bulgarians manage to escape and hide in the older quarter of Varosha. The searching yields no result because it is impossible to distinguish the prisoners who have been given civilian clothes from the citizen of the town. The German commandment of Ohrid holds a group of prominent local citizens as hostages and delivers an ultimatum: return the prisoners by sunset or Varosha will be razed the ground. In the tense hours that follow the people of Ohrid are faced with a dreadful dilemma: they can save the town by committing an ignominious betrayal or preserve their honor and sacrifice their homes. Then a new ultimatum is issued: the require 10 kg gold as a ransom. The citizens must part with their last pieces of jeweler and precious keepsakes. The theme of the mass heroism of ordinary people who choose human dignity rather than security is conveyed in a context of relentlessly mounting suspense.
