In the infinity of space there is a planet with two faces turning around an old white sun to which it always shows the same side. The other is enveloped in total darkness. On each face life has developed in a different way. The bright side is inhabited by people who call themselves Strefis the illuminated ones while the dark side is populated by the Ugeltz the people of night. No Ugeltz has ever seen a Strefis however each civilization remembers the other in legends.
