It's the reality show that's invading malls across America! It all begins when six ordinary women are ambushed while shopping. They're challenged by the show's guy/girl host team to compete against each other in a one-of-a kind beauty pageant. The race to win the crown and the big prize begins that instant! They are given only three hours (and $500) to prepare for the swimsuit evening wear and talent contests. What will run out first - the cash or the clock? Will their shopping companions bring out the best - or bring on the meltdown? No matter what goes on during the day at night it's all about what happens under the spotlight when a live audience will cast their votes and viewers witness an ordinary woman transformed into Miss Instant Beauty!
