Shot on location in Zanzibar the story revolves around Zamora a well traveled Zanzibar painter/womanizer on a voyage of self discovery. Filled with romantic connotations about the spice island he meets a beautiful Zanzibar / Omani woman who mesmerizes and influences him to buy a dhow( sail boat) to have a comfortable life in Paradise. Zamora's passion for the unknown a reckless adventurous lifestyle and a sordid past lands him in nightmarish situations. Through three separate emotionally charged relationships (Zulfa Saada and Zareena) he almost becomes a victim of the confrontation between the good and the evil. Zulfa stands for pure innocent love but is tied down by traditional restrictions. Saada stands for the mystical magical and unconditioned side to the African psyche. Zareena stands for power and obsession and its corrupting impact. The film explores the adoptive nature of the African spirit with all its consequent pros and cons.
