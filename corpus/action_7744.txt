In the quiet Washington D.C. community of Farrington County young wealthy Colombian Diplomat and alleged drug kingpin Alfonso Medina is back on the street after beating a drug distribution rap. After his father is killed in an attempted drug operation by the frustrated Farrington police Alfonso grabs the powerful position as head of the Medina family crime organization. Soon he begins to believe that he is invincible godlike and that laws rules and mere mortals can not touch him. With those delusions of grandeur Medina embarks on a lucrative new venture the international sale of children for prostitution and pornography. Now he's in the domain of hard-working hard-playing detectives Erik Kana (writer-director Carlos Roman) and Debbie Cooper (co-executive producer Debbie Harvey). Kana is a Spanish-Italian by the gun chauvinistic womanizing widowed and financially independent police detective who is raising his teenage daughter alone. Cooper is an attractive single liberated no-nonsense and by-the-book detective. Thrown together in this case they must juggle complicated personal lives with their commitment to good ol' American justice. Mismatch is an epic that cuts through the political and social strata of Washington to reveal the wheelings and dealings of a system gone sour.
