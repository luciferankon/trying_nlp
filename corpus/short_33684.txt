This true story of a young Jewish woman growing up in Berlin at the time of Hitler's rise to power begins as a vividly detailed chronicle of her charmed and secure life at the center of which is the family's walled garden. But outside the anti-semitism that has always existed becomes a shattering force as the Nazis take control and her family decides to abandon Germany forever. This moving short film combines the family's home movies (which have been re-photographed with special effects) with overlapping soundtracks in order to re-create their "time in the garden."
