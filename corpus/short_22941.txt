Bulgaria is home for an amazing number of wild birds - over 400 species! In Europe only the skies of Spain beat that number. The film takes us on an exciting journey to the bedazzling bird world in the southeastern end of our continent. Tyulenovo and Durankulak are trapped in the severe grip of the winter ice and snow but the Red-breasted Geese still prefer this land for their wintering territory. The Long-legged Buzzards protect their kingdom from the sky above the majestic Belogradchik Rocks. Deep in the heart of the Rhodope Mountains we can still admire the Egyptian Vulture one of the most intelligent birds in the world. Along the Arda River Canyon surrounded by volcanic rock Griffon Vultures scramble clumsily for food. The mysterious stone dolmens in Sakar Mountain enjoy the company of the last 23 pairs of Imperial Eagles in Bulgaria. Just outside the city of Burgas a popular bird the White Stork displays its character; flocks of pelicans glide impressively over the apartment blocks and the female waders enjoy the summer bliss attended by their thin-billed suitors in the warm waters of sea lagoons.
