A diaristic view of parts of Paris Belgium and Amsterdam. The Turkish family on their stoop the woman on the train with her two pit bulls and an admirer interiors exteriors the views from the train and the canals of the flat lands. Laid over are sound recorded at the same locations providing correlating fragments of conversations that Plays says are on sidewalk life in Belgium and narratives of a beating heart of a fish whose eggs are poisonous to both the rich and poor." Here the recording properties of the camera and the microphone are the thing; people alternatively appear to react to and ignore the camera. There are objects events and locations - it is left to the viewer's intuition to secure the story." - Stuart Cutlitz
