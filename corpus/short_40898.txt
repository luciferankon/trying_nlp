A parody music video based on the popular girl band "K3" in Belgium. In the original song "Alle Kleuren" the three girls address how living together in peace should be an easy thing to do regardless of sex race and age. Disregarding the original lyrics Jordy incorporated some visuals that suggest the opposite and used an all-male cast to represent the girls in the video. This video was released while "Studio 100" the company behind "K3" was holding auditions in order to find three new girls to continue the legacy of the former "K3" members.
