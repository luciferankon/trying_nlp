Ben works in a morgue. Ben's wife left him and he is into various kinds of alternative sexuality. Teresa dies of an ecstasy overdose on the dance floor. When she is brought to the morgue she is resurrected -how shall I say?- in Ben's arms (that part based on a true story). From this starting point the film revolves around the interactions between them and Boris (orgy fan) Abdel (no sentimental life) Ducon (wants to kill himself) Nico (dying of AIDS) etc... A social study of the 90s with heavy references to sex and death.
