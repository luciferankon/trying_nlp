It's the night of the Canadian Screen Awards and the country is buzzing on who will take home the golden statues. Steve Patterson hits the streets with a statue in hand to ask Canadians who they think will win what ideas they have for the next great television show or film (Steve will run a few ideas by them) and how well they know there Canadian film and trivia. Along the way Steve will also run into a few CSA nominees and have some fun with them. The take away is a fun light and breezy show that acts a primer/delicious appetizer before the CSA show and builds confidence and loyalty for our own productions.
