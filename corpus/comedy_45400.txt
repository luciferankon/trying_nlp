follows a quietly observant child Oscar as he copes with the dramatics of his recently divorced mother. He spends his lunches in the janitor's closet at school writing thoughtful reviews of each restaurant his mom dragged him to the night before. He treats the reviews as a diary documenting his complex relationship with his mother as they both "grow up" in the wake of a divorce.
