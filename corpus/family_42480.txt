This is the final show of our Enlightened Forest Trilogy. Years after The Big Bad Wolf gains mayoral control over the Enchanted Forest he sets his eyes on a higher prize to become president of the forest. After rigging the elections the Big Bad Wolf is not only victorious but crowns himself as "Lord Wolf". Under his control he has decimated the land to a totalitarian/dystopian community where the citizens are under his rule and control. The people of the enchanted look to have their voices heard and will not let anything get in their way of allowing Lord Wolf to reign any longer. Lord Wolf has come across a very ancient secret of the forest that could give him the power to have world domination. Can he be stopped in time or will it be too late?
