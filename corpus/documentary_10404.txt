We think of the arctic as a pristine wilderness. When scientists went to collect breast milk from Inuit mothers they were expecting to find the purest milk anywhere on earth. But the levels went off the scale. The milk of the Inuit mothers was loaded with chemicals migrating from the south. In this beautiful and thought-provoking film artist and film maker Roz Mortimer leads us on a hypnotic journey to the high arctic. Using medieval texts and maps to question hierarchies of knowledge Mortimer shows us epic scenes of contemporary Inuit life explores their traditional connection to the earth and stages dramatic tableaux vivant in landscapes of frozen sea. A unique and sensitive portrait of a territory and its people.
