Drivers who have been given traffic tickets (for speeding illegal turns or other violations) and decide to fight the ticket have their day in court. If the officer doesn't show up they can show through evidence (charts photos witnesses) why the ticket was not warranted. The judge either upholds the ticket and fines them or dismisses the ticket.
