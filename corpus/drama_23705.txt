Just Don't Think I'll Cry became one of twelve films and film projects-almost an entire year's production-that were banned in 1965-1966 due to their alleged anti-socialist aspects.

In 1989 cinematographer Ost restored the original version and this and most of the other banned films were finally screened in January 1990. Belatedly they were acclaimed as masterpieces of critical realism.
