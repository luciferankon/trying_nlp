'Children of the Pyre' is a compelling real-life self-narrative of seven extraordinary children who make their living out of the dead. They collect snatch or steal used coffin shrouds and sell them for petty amounts in order to ensure their own and their family's survival Tempered by the heat of the pyre strengthened in the face of adversities and crafted by a volley of abuses these imps weave through the pyres and struggle through disdain in this land of the dead. Laughing smiling weeping fighting and shouting these children run the race for survival - winning it again and again - everyday. The film is a terrible saga of exploitation that celebrates the victory of innocence over the most harrowing realities of life. It's a torturous journey through seared bodies callous minds and dead consciences that constitute the human reality of the ghats at Varanasi
