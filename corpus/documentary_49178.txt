In this personal documentary director Sobaz Benjamin introduces us to an interesting group of people: a black woman who wants to be considered iconically Canadian a white man who is culturally and psychologically black and a black woman who decides to leave "Canada's racial cold war." He also exposes himself a black man who grew up trying to bleach his skin. In the end Race Is a Four-Letter Word teaches us that the soul has no colour. Yet we also learn that race is a marathon we are all forced to run.
