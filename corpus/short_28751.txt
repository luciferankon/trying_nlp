An animated short about a miserable man stuck in a very bad job with untrustworthy machinery and angry bosses. Created by animator Tim Searfoss the film is a madcap fable of alienated labor drawn in an expressive sketchy style. The unnamed working man mans a machine in an insane factory full of impossible mechanical flourishes and a labyrinthine infinity to it that reminds me of the futuristic hellscapes of Tartakovsky's Samurai Jack. And while there's a simple plot at work it drives home an important idea about the costs of mistreated labor and the ways in which misery unlike wealth tends to flow downward.
