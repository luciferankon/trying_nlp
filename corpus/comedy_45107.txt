Two young brothers strive to create produce and market nothing short of an Eisner Award winning comic-book series based on the notion that their father when not plodding at his mundane dayjob is secretly a pickpocket. From writer/director Pablo D'Stair (Science Fiction; Mississippy Missippi Tu-Polo) M.R PICKPOCKET is a comedy about the exhilarating (and often absurd) process of making Art and the ups and downs that come with brotherhood.
