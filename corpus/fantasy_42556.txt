Anna has just buried her beloved aunt as California waits once more for the big quake to hit. Unsure of where she is going she climbs into her old convertible for a trip through the desert. Along the way she meets a series of bizarre characters including two dancing glitter girls a crazy jogger and a heartbreaking crooner. Anna's friends and family also appear repeatedly to her in her car for imaginary conversations. The levels of time and perception of the past and present begin to merge and the trip increasingly becomes a journey into Anna's consciousness. THE BIG ONE is not a film about an earthquake but rather a road movie about life love and the big questions: who am I where do I come from and where am I going? What we eventually realize is that everything that is is material for what will come.
