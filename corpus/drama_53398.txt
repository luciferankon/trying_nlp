This story is about the struggle of a human being fighting for what is right. Surbhi wants everyone to know that Saumya is just as much a part of the society as everyone else and she is no different from the rest of us that she is not an outcast and deserves to live a happy life and be loved the same way everyone else does. Surbhi demands answers from people as to why transgender people are treated differently and stigmatized through no fault of their own striving for a change.
