Apricots in Armenia are a very important symbol. Intertwined with history and bearing the name of their origin prunus armeniaca (Armenian prune) is enjoyed in every aspect of daily life. The apricot has inspired many legends. Even the ancient gods had a special affinity for the apricot. It adorns manuscripts paintings and architecture. Yet as it is a fruit with a short harvest season Armenians have found creative ways to enjoy this miracle fruit year round. One way is to drink apricot vodka and sing about it all year!
