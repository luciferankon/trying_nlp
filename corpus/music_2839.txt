On February 11 2012 Mastodon took the stage at London's O2 Academy Brixton capping off the band's world tour for their fifth studio album "The Hunter." This sold out performance was the band's first show at Brixton. In addition to performing their latest songs "Curl of the Burl" "Black Tongue" and "Dry Bone Valley" the band dug into their catalog performing "Colony of Birchmen" "Capillarian Crest" and "Iron Tusk." Critics said this 23-song set list captures "an intense display of dark riffs and crushing choruses." Rolling Stone says "'The Hunter' demonstrates how contemporary radio rock can still be made with imagination precision and a majestic sense of force."
