Cake Lush is a show all about Greggy and his pursuit of making it in NYC. He came from CA to conquer NYC and has had many trials along the way. He has a super fun quirky and personality driven staff and we watch all of these characters personal and professional lives collide while trying to make it to the top from scratch.
