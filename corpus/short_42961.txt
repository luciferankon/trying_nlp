Some days I tell myself I don't deserve my friends. Others where I look at them looking at me and thinking: "Everybody failed since the beginning of times but we WILL make it". And then I think: "Even this idea will get old so hurry up let's film it." I scribbled a story about parents taking their children in hostage asked a very beautiful girl to play the part of the boy who wants them all. I cast it onto a big screen and see how it works. There they are my friends on a big screen because I find them so handsome.
