A mythological film. Babbruwahan (bilimoria) son of Arjuna and Chitrangada fights heroically in the Mahabharata war and returns to his mother who despairs at the strife between her son and her husband. He stops a horse that belongs to Arjuna's army which is a sign of defiance that leads to further bloodshed. Babruwahan defeats and beheads his own father and is about to follow his mother in an act of ritual suicide when Krishna descends to earth and instructs him to go to the land of the serpents and fetch the mythical Sanjivani Mani to bring Arjuna back to life. This pits Babruwahan against Ullupi daughter of the serpent king and a former wife of Arjuna. After another battle she is forced to surrender the sanjivani mani but instead she captures the dead Arjuna's head. Krishna has to intervene again to resolve matters.
