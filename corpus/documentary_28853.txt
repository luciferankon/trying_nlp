"Flunked" narrated by Joe Mantegna is a full-length documentary designed to be both informative and entertaining without compromising the truth of the crisis we are facing in education today. Most people are well aware of the declining test scores and competitiveness of the average American student as well as myriad other problems facing education today. However complaining about the problem while easy to do produces little productive results. Instead "Flunked" focuses on many of today's schools nationwide that are "getting it right"---attaining great results in terms of college preparation high test scores and graduating competent workers for tomorrow's economy
