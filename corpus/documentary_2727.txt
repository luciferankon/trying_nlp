Aaron's improbable odyssey began simply enough walking his dog at the beach. As he used his palm to smooth over some sand to make a place to sit down and take a rest he grazed over a buried hypodermic needle. He picked it up relieved to not have been cut and looked around him - plastic garbage strewn all over. Were there more? His place of peace and reflection suddenly felt dangerous. He went home picked up a rake and headed back to clean up: straws cheese spreaders tire caps toothbrushes bottle caps army men bubble blowers shotgun shells. This was the moment that touched off his tireless solo campaign. This humble accidental activist is a man who cares deeply about the coastline neatly sorting his finds into orderly buckets baskets and drawers. Sometimes he'll take select pieces from his collection to create assemblages for friends and post to Instagram. Rather than falling into a trap of despair over the constant flow of new waste washing up Aaron draws on irony optimism creativity and a penchant for finding small treasures (he's particularly fond of the Army Men) to transform a desperate environmental issue into his own personal story of triumph over the day-to-day heaviness of life. Through this process one of the more wondrous facets of humanity emerges - the ability to transform a desperate environmental problem into a narrative through action art and dedication to a cause.
