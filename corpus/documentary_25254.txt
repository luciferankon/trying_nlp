Experience the Fight for Fort Fisher! Late in 1864 during the intensity of the Civil War Federal troops attacked Fort Fisher in Wilmington North Carolina with a massive naval armada and hundreds of ground troops. The bloody battle that ensued resulted in the Civil War's heaviest naval bombardments. After the second battle in January 1865 Fort Fisher finally fell. As a result the port of Wilmington closed cutting the vital supply line to General Lee's army (and three months later Lee surrendered). Confederate Goliath is based on the award-winning book by Civil War historian Rod Gragg.
