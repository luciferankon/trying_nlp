The film sets a riddle: how do we find 'what is lost'? How do we restore our connection with the creative with the infinite possibilities of a human life? How do we find the path with heart in a world which drags us in the opposite direction? Our heroine Sita struggles with this dilemma as we all do: she has grown up in Wales under the wing of her Uncle Mal a kind of wizard speaking the language absorbing the culture at home in the landscape. But aged nine she is carted off to London by her ambitious doctor dad and years later when she comes back after Uncle Mal has died she has forgotten her Welsh self and the infinite magic of her early days. The film follows her struggle to come to terms with the mysterious tradition of the Children of Don the race who her uncle said 'brought magic to these islands'.
