While it holds the place of the fourth largest city in Pennsylvania the city of Erie is small enough that many residents have a sense of distinct connectivity. With a rising rate of gun violence in recent years this connectivity can lead to the messiness of retaliation violence but can also provide the opportunity for community healing. After a particular violent summer in 2015 which included the deaths of three teenage boys a group of local social work students spent the year creating this film as a medium to showcase the voices of these victims' mothers and friends as well as local community leaders in an attempt to humanize the face of violence in a city that has become increasingly numb to gunfire. "Let it Begin With Me" captures the raw aftermath of the deaths of Elijah (16) Shakur (16) and Jacob (18) in the months after their murders. Within this aftermath however we see a community's unshakable passion for justice and peace emerge and channel into a call for action. Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me.
