In the sticks of Kentucky a demented family of inbreds begin the process of cleaning up their blood line. Their twisted family is led by Billy Bob Hackford who in his madness abducts unsuspecting young women. As a sadistic sport the clan forces the girls to fight gladiator style to the death to determine the strongest. Billy Bob then rapes the victor in hopes of a pregnancy and expanding the Hackford family. The Hackford's plan changes when they abduct Amber Strickland a southern tom boy whose family ties run as deep as her abductors. She's not a victim or prey but a huntress raised in the backwoods of Alabama. Her brothers Bear and Brody track her down and a feud of country folks erupt into a massacre with only the strongest to survive.
