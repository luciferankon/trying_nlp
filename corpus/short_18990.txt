Many people at some point in their lives consider writing their own songs or indeed making their own recording. Given that the finished sound of a record is made up of an often puzzling array of overdubs and layers of sound this can prove to be a more difficult task than expected. Producer and songwriter Paul Pilot likes to keep things simple. In this beautifully shot and endearingly short film he endeavors to debunk the myths of 'productions secrets' by showing exactly what can make up a finished piece of music. An ode to DIY recording!
