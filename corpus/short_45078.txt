The five poems of the series have in order "Love" "Bereavement" "Friendship" "Meeting and Parting" and "War" as the subjects. Three of these are pastoral namely the first third and fourth. "Love" is the form of an eclogue; "Friendship" is purely pastoral while "Meeting and Parting" forms an idyll. The reader will understand of course that a pastoral poem treats of scenes and incidents in rural or country life as apart from community or city life and that the characters in the earliest forms or this composition were shepherds due to the fact that the primitive occupation of the dwellers In the country was that of tending to flocks and herds of sheep and cattle. He will understand too that an eclogue is a choice picked selection from pastoral poems and that an idyll is a short highly wrought descriptive pastoral poem in which the episodes or circumstances are of rural simplicity and coloring. And so with these few words of introduction let us view the pictures. All these scenes are beautifully colored and the photography is excellent. The characters too are cleverly enacted. The effect produced by seeing the pictures for the first time is likely to be one of regret that they cannot at once be repeated. I believe in this case that patrons will consider it a boon should exhibitors run the reel off for the second time say after an appropriate song has been sung to afford a short interlude. The reel is only 400 feet in length but it has so much of beauty art and satisfying merit that one cannot grasp its full meaning and worth at one showing.
