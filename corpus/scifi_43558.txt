Dagon is a burned out hitman who wants nothing more than to retire off world and find some peace of mind. When he is offered his dream score from the kingpin Kundilla he takes it knowing full well it will be his most dangerous job ever. He is to steal a human child from an earth ship arriving on the troll planet Goth and deliver her to Kundilla who will in turn deliver her to the buyer. There is only one problem; Dagon is not as cold blooded as he thinks he is and when he finds out the true reason the buyer wants the child; to kill and eat her he goes rogue deciding to instead return her to her parents. Now he is on the run with two friends trying to stay one step ahead of the assassins and hitmen sent out after him.
