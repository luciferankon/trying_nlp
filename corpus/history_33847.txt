Touring Historic America focused on the events places and cultural anthropology of the most unique nation in the world; ours. Brought to life by historians and reenactments we learn how these places and events shaped our history. The pilot episode starts in Philadelphia and moves to Bedford Pennsylvania to cover an event called the Whiskey Rebellion. They used descendants of actual participants in the Whiskey Rebellion as well as actors and reenactors. They also showed how the past influences the present by showing the town of Bedford's preoccupation with it's place in history.
