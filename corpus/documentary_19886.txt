The film contains the journey taken in search of a lost song. Famous singer Rasoolan Bai from 1950s India used her own singing methods and changed the lyrics to create different versions of the 'thumri' (a genre of traditional Indian music) songs [My Heart is Wounded Don't Throw Flowers at Me]. Her own singing style and ever-changing lyrics make this song a rare gem. As the film gropes after her life it finds her friends song collectors and succeeding generations of 'thumri' singers.
