Koto is a restless and impulsive young African born in a refugee camp. His life in Spain among the paddy fields of the Delta passes by with few changes always under the protection of his foster parents. He has left behind the tough childhood he had in the Saharan refugee camp where he was born. One morning just like any other Koto's life is turned upside down. He feels as though his head is about to explode. He walks outside trying to escape it and collapses a few metres from his home. Once he has recovered the doctors tell him that he urgently needs a kidney transplant. The best choice as a possible donor would be his biological mother. The sudden arrival of his Saharan family is a shock for Koto who watches as the life he has been living for the past 10 years falls apart around him. Far removed from the beliefs and customs of his people the young man must deal with his origins to try to save his own life. The film is based on a real story and played by Koto himself. The appearance of the real-life main character in such a dramatic and traumatic story makes this a film in which reality and fiction blend together.
