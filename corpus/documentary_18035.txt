While still a student Evelyn Glennie learned that she was going deaf. Rather than abandon her study of music in which she had shown such talent she instead turned her focus toward percussion instruments and developed her ability to feel the sound through her body. This documentary follows her as she performs in New York Germany and Tokyo sharing her insights into the nature of music and the ways in which we experience it.
