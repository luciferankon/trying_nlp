Life on Mt. Everest is hard. Hard on the spirit. Hard on the body. Dr. Luanne Freer assembles an all volunteer staff of doctors porters and Sherpas in her quest to provide expert high altitude medical care to climbers attempting summit bids on the world's highest peak. Her mission: To take the proceeds garnered from treatments for well-funded expeditions and offer free medical care to the indigenous Sherpa people who make their meager yearly income during the climbing season. When American climber Joe Hughes contracts High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) at 24000 feet his lungs begin to fill and teammates must drag him 7000 vertical feet down the mountain to Dr. Freer. By the time he arrives at Everest E.R. he is literally drowning in his own blood. This film follows Luanne FreerMD a young woman doctor from Montana and founder of the base camp medical clinic -17500 feet up Mt. Everest. Her treatments range from retinal burns and emergency tooth extractions to the life and death struggle of one climber who contracts an acute case of High Altitude Pulmonary Edema. Whether he lives of dies is up to Dr. Freer and Chomolungma - "The Goddess Mother of the Earth:" Mt. Everest.
