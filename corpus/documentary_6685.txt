A Perfect Cure is an immersive and exploratory documentary that looks at differences between the medical model of disability and the social model of disability while following 3 subjects whose lives have changed significantly due to loss of vision. While all of the subjects did seek medical treatments for their blindness we learn about their acceptance of the disability and how that shift in thought has affected their quality of life.
