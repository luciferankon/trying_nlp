Based on H P Lovecraft's tale "The Shunned House" presents the stories of three people who all died within the confines of the dark and isolated chateau. Each story is taken from a different period in time yet they combine with one another to reveal the house's dark past to a journalist specialising in the paranormal and his sceptic girlfriend.
