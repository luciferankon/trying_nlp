The Electric League of Pittsburgh encourages everyone to buy an electric refrigerator in this short. A hand is visible holding open a refrigerator door: inside are milk lettuce tomatoes or fruit grapes and a small platter of sliced meat or vegetables. In the freezer compartment are a couple of metal trays. A woman in an apron enters the frame bends over and picks up the platter. A title card discloses that an electric refrigerator provides convenience and comfort promotes health and is economical. A scrolling message invites all to the refrigerator show April 5th to 19th on Liberty Avenue: free admission!
