A Little Piece of Heaven tells a story of love friendship and solidarity aspects of life that allows us to live with dignity even at the most difficult of times. Set within the walls of a Communist prison of the 1950s a tale unfolds of a young couples' fragile love. An angry young man Lubos ('Jakub Doubrava' (qv)) always felt defiance toward everything around him and eventually this trait lands him in court. The verdict is clear and the punishment long and hard. But even in prison Lubos is unable to tame his love of jazz or the eternally blazing flame of rebellion he carries inside. There is no place on earth where love cannot grow. Lubos meets Dana ('Tatiana Pauhofov√°' (qv)) in prison. Out of solidarity and support their fellow prisoners hatch a small rebellion to help them fulfill their love - a love which has appeared in the wrong place at the wrong time.
