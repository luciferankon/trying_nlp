This film continues the tendency to produce paradoxical comedies of anti fascism which started with Gueorgui Stoyanov's early work in late sixties. In the last days of the WWII the provincial teacher Panteley arrives in Sofia to visit a cousin. Accidentally he becomes involved in the conflicts of the times. Out of pure humanity Panteley takes a wounded person to the nearest hospital where he leaves his passport as well. The wounded proves to be a resistance fighter. Left without identity papers Panteley does underground. This is the beginning of his ' amateur' resistance in a string of comic situations. They reveal the absurdity of the clash between sound reason and the fascist police system. In his search for a way out and constantly threatened with arrest Panteley performs a series of courageous acts without being aware of it. He thus lives to see Victory Day but his luck of identity papers faces him once again with the risk of being suspected.
