This thirty minute documentary follows the efforts of volunteers from Sun City Texas that come together on a mission to show appreciation to the soldiers at Fort Hood. Each week retirees from Georgetown TX give heartfelt thank yous to soldiers reporting for duty at Fort Hood as well as those injured in combat. This documentary accentuated by stunning imagery of America's largest military base follows the volunteers as they collect cookies brownies and doughnuts from local stores and baked goods made by people in the community to distribute at the Army base. The retirees travel more than 50 miles with cars filled to the brim with treats to hand the treats to hundreds of soldiers getting processed at Fort Hood every Thursday. Not only do these volunteers walk the lines giving treats and saying thanks to the incoming troops but they also bring food to the Wounded Warriors buildings where severely injured soldiers are recovering and to the Fisher House which gives a home to military families to be close to a loved one during hospitalization. Many of the volunteers are veterans themselves and have incredible stories of their own survival in war. Their reasons for giving back are both moving and remarkable. Along the way the viewers will also hear from the troops that receive the treats and find out how the kindness of strangers affects them.
