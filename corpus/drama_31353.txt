In the later years of the nineteenth century Latin master Mr. Chipping is the mainstay of Brookfields boys boarding school a good teacher and a kindly person but he is considered to be married to the job so that it is a surprise when on a walking holiday he meets and marries the vivacious Kathiewho becomes his helpmate at the school but sadly pre-deceases him. Just before World War One insensitive new headmaster Ralston tries to edge Chipping out but the boys rally and Sir John Rivers an old pupil of Chipping's and now head of the board of governors invites him to stay andwhen the war breaks out and Ralston joins up Chipping becomes the new head. He is saddened by the waste of young lives in the pointless war and also by the death of his old friend and former German teacher Max who had returned to his homeland to fight for Germany and he reminds the assembled boys that an individual's goodness is more important than their nationality. It is a sad day for all concerned when Chipping himself passes away.
