One of the tenants is Mylene (Lovi Poe) who appears like the perfect girl nice pretty and at the top of her Medicine class. But nobody knows about her past not even the man who loves her most Paolo (Benjamin Alvez). Paolo doesn't know anything about Mylene's family her long lost sibling or her estranged nervous wreck of a mother. Nor does he know about the very long scar that runs across Mylene's body nor of how incomplete she always feels. And he finds that the more he tries to win back her love the more she retreats to her secret world that nobody could enter. One day Mylene asked to perform an abortion for fee she feels conflicted about doing what' is right and at the same time being in dire need of tuition fee. Her decision ultimately leads to a dark outcome and awakens a force that has laid quiet for years in the boardinghouse grounds.

When one by one the boarders die of unexplainable causes Joanna (Empress Shuck) the resident psychic and Mylene's best friend struggles to understand the impending danger that she senses and decides to get to the bottom of the mystery; and as it unravels they find themselves confronted by an angry soul that seeks justice.
