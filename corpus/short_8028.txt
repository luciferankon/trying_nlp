Well over seven minutes long filled with snatches of nonsensical ramblings and saturated with intense parody and unnecessary detail Cavegirl Productions' "FOURGE" stands as a unique achievement in twenty-first century short filmmaking. Not only do we find a scavenger hunt list that illustrates the specific absurdity of our tale with items ranging from sweet candy kisses to primitive weaponry and sexy blonde wigs but this story also contains a wide variety of interesting characters each with its own distinctive culture body type and history ranging from the homey to the majestic. "FOURGE" follows four brave souls venturing boldly into the unknown on an epic quest - will greed or fellowship ultimately win? As we journey from a parking lot to a warehouse to an alley and back again you will discover an amazing variety of people places musical instruments and totally odd completely random things - all by passing through the remnants of a history long forgotten.
