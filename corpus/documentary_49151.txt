Daniel Cordus grandson of African warrior Cordus - who was recruited for the colonial army in the Dutch East Indies - was captured as a POW when the Japanese Imperial Army invaded the colony in March 1942. Together with his two older brothers he was put to work along the Death Railway between Burma and Thailand. While Daniel's brother Jan did not survive captivity his other brother Jozef was killed during the civil war that raged in the colony right after the war. As Dutch citizens the descendants of African warriors were forced to leave the new republic of Indonesia in 1950. Through the years in The Netherlands Daniel Cordus has fought for recognition of all Indo-Africans who have died for the Dutch flag. Seventy years after his captivity he finally returns to Burma to visit the grave of his brother Jan.
