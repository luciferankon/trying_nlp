Summertime August. Holidaymakers take the motorway to the south. Philippe has a professional appointment in Lyon. His old mate Aur√©lien is driving to Marseille with Balthazar his son. No problem they'll drop him. Sweat icecreams melting on children's clothes rest areas concrete picnic tables lines to gas station's restroom playgrounds tepid melon slices gazoline smell couldn't care less of Philippe's desperation. Then Philippe wants to leave. Balthazar holds him back.
