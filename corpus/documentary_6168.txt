Francisco Fernández is a school teacher who started a revolutionary educational experiment in 1970: for six years he used the classrooms of the state school in Orellana la Vieja (Badajoz) to selfmanage the school and find a kind of alternative education which would serve their own popular purposes and not those of Franco's regime and the economic system which supported this dictator. Twenty five years later Francisco Fernández and his former pupils who are now forty years old recall the importance of the school in their lives. It also shows Paideia a libertarian school which has been in Mérida for twenty three years. Its founder Josefa Martín Luengo remembers these difficult times and her constant commitment to an alternative type of education.
