A politician giving a speech has 120 seconds to convince the crowd to vote for him. Making quick calculations based on their cheers and jeers he moves away from promising jobs (that will result in money and happiness but that take work) to promises to lower taxes send the poor to work camps and raise money for the army. His final platform: "Do you want to be rich now? Vote for me." The crowd goes wild. Before a dense and ecstatic crowd a crafty politician gives a rousing speech. However time is against him as he only has 120 seconds to win his audience pivoting around two premises: happiness and wealth. As the political candidate uses his persuasive strategy glorifying the money and consumerism over the dignity that derives from a job somehow the land of utopia comes just a bit closer giving a taste of bliss in the mouths of the mesmerised voters. Of course any resemblance to political reality is purely coincidental.
