Can music that is intrinsically off beat and inharmonic be beautiful? How might such music be created in a natural non-goal oriented way? The Japanese band Otto & Orabu (sound and shout) created at Shobu Gakuen a facility for people with intellectual disabilities takes on this challenge. The band is made up of staff members facility and students. Shin Fukumori the director principal and the band's conductor at Shobu Gakuen is fascinated by the effect created by out the unbalanced music. He encourages the staff to play more freely-taking inspiration from the facility residents. However the thousands of years of conformity that has been cultivated in Japanese society makes the "liberation" hard for the staff members. Through Fukumori's conversations with the staff and residents the band come to a path and plays with pure joy-not overthinking and not forcing the uneven music into the limelight. Then amazing collaboration is born and it manifests at the climax of the film which is a spellbinding music performance given by the band at a concert hall in Nagoya.
