A farm team-leader Tudor is accused for having failed the harvesting. Unhappy with what he considers an unfair verdict he leaves the farm and moves to another village getting a job as an ordinary worker in another farm. At first he is upset by the very severe leader of that team Mihai but soon he discovers that his hard style is necessary to keep the work in good order and face all the problems. He also finds a bunch of great friends (the "Swell Guys" / "...baieti grozavi" in the title) and learns in what had consisted his own past mistakes.
