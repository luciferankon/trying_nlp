Pygmalion is a lovely young pyg brought up in a dysfunctional pyg family that speaks in the guttural patois of the street where she sells flowers to survive. She's spotted by two handsome princes Pyggins and Pyggering and Lady Pyggette whose hoof they compete for. Pyggins bets Pyggering he can pass Pygmalion off to high pyg society simply by training her to speak in proper tones. Pyggins seeks to impress Lady Pyggette unaware that that the flower girl will do anything to please the prince pyg she loves. Pyggins plan appears to work while Pygmalion goes beyond being the belle of society. Their roles are reversed and Pyggins has to win Pygmalion's heart over a slew of other suitors. Lady Pyggets meanwhile pulls out all the stops to prove Pygmalion is just a flower girl.
