The year is 1980 and an agreement between Cuban-Americans and the Cuban government resulted in a decree by Fidel Castro that allowed Cubans to leave their homeland Cuba freely without repercussions. Consequently a mass exodus of over 120 000 Cubans which later came to be known as Marielitos arrived in South Florida. The Department of Justice (DOJ) along with Immigration Naturalization Services (INS) was scrambling to find a way to manage and process the permanent asylum statuses for this vast number of Cubans refugees. The movie Scarface depicted this scenario. A solution was then devised to place them in refugee camps while waiting processing. Once processed all Cubans would be able to remain in the US. Now it's 1987 and seven years later South Florida is again inundated with refugees. However this time it is not the Cubans but Haitians. Haitian refugees started arriving in South Florida in large numbers fleeing their homeland Haiti immediately before and after President Jean Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier was kicked out of power.
