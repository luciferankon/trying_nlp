Private investigator LOU LUCK (LUCCIARDI) returns from a failed assignment in Australia to his hometown of Cincinnati. He is hired by AUDREY LANE wife of deceased (murdered) DONALD LANE CEO of Quartermain Electronics to protect her from the violence that has already claimed the lives of other family members including her younger sister NOREEN. Lou meets MANLEY PRESTON--an Australian--at a bar. The two are forced into a quick friendship by taking each others part in a brawl. In actuality Preston is a mercenary hired by the RUSSIANS to eliminate the key individuals in the Quartermain upper echelons and to recover stolen Soviet missile codes. Kozinsky's motive--besides money--is revenge against the Russians for killing his brother IVAN. A third half-brother DEMKO is the mastermind behind the entire scheme. Audrey's goal is to have Preston eliminate all the Quartermain people give her the codes and then leave the Russians locked out of their own missile system. With control of the company and possession of the new codes she will have unlimited cooperation from the U.S. government with Quartermain. Preston is killed by Demko whom COMMANDER RUTKIN (Demko's superior) has dispatched to Cincinnati to personally finish the business kill Kozinsky and retrieve the new codes. Lou takes Demko back to Kozinsky's house where Lou discovers Kozinsky is actually a friend he knows as BOOBIE. In a quick skirmish Kozinsky and Demko are killed and Lou retrieves Boobie's off-shore banking information. Later he reveals what he knows to Audrey. The film ends with Lou in his office narrating his final move: deciding how to spend Boobie's/Kozinky's money.
