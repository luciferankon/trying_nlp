A low-to-the-ground car equipped with spoked wheels a hydraulic suspension system plus a glossy paint job. And what's more: it bounces. To own one of these extravagant rides is a dream come true to a whole lot of people. But it's not only about affording it. You have to earn it. This is the world we're introduced to on Lowrider Brazil as we're taken to Vida Real and see what it's like at Brazil's pioneering lowrider car club. The mastermind in charge of getting the club in full gear is Tatá joined by his sidekicks Japonęs and Alemăo. Tatá is known for his no-nonsense approach towards newcomers. Japonęs is a hot-headed auto mechanic. As for Alemăo he's a true chicano and specializes in lowrider bike projects. The everyday challenges faced by these heroes and their ties with other lowrider aficionados are given special attention in a setting marked by a strict moral code where everyone's devoted to a common passion: building lowrider cars and bikes.
