Parfenov's film about Mikhail Gorbachev "He Came to Give Us Freedom" is an attempt to understand why the Stavropol guy had that kind of internal freedom and how he managed to preserve it while getting to the heights of power without spilling it. Parfenov talks with the first president of the USSR about the most important phenomenon in Gorbachev's life his love to his wife Raisa. The film has a lot of politically important allusions to the present times bold and strong conclusions and Gorbachev's confessions.
