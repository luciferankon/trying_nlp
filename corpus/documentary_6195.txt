A Man a doctrine. We went to Cinisi to look for people who had followed Peppino Impastato's life and search: his mother Felicia Bortolotta for whom her son only "wanted to do the right thing" the friends in the associations "Music and Culture" "Om Group" "Radio Aut" with whom he fought resignation the apathetic conspiracy of silence trying to pass on the strength of the community and the weapons of culture. We filmed everything that still today keeps him alive. His corpse was found along the railway of the Palermo-Trapani line near the city of Cinisi the morning of the 9th of May 1978 the same day in which the body of Aldo Moro was found. One of the possible causes of his death was thought to be suicide due to depression. 24 years later the 11th of April 2002 a sentence of the Court of Appeal states that he was killed by the Mafia. We wanted to document the impotence of death of violence of misery. No thought can be killed by the powers that be.
