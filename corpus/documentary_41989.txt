In a corner of Victoria exists a link to an ancient culture unlike anywhere else in Australia. A place of astounding beauty and rare archaeological and environmental significance it is being degraded on an annual basis. As the clock ticks an unlikely partnership could see it saved for future generations while providing a moving example of reconciliation between white and black Australians. The film is a portrait of a hidden facet of Australian history and environment and a musing on what reconciliation can look like. While exploring the mysterious scarred trees middens and stone scatters left at one remarkable site we meet the people who are working against the clock - and the odds - to preserve what they can of the site. With organic relics at its heart - hundred year old scarred and dying trees - the film examines the preservation of culture and environment.
