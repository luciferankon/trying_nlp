War Matters is a 50-minute documentary following the struggle of Brian Haw and the other protesters who occupied Parliament Square in London for over 10 years in protest against the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The film questions what power the people have to influence their politicians and details Brian's battle with the government as it introduces new laws to evict him and his mistreatment by the police through to his ultimate death.
