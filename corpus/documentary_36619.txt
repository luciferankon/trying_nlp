Paws for Autism follows two autistic children and their service dogs. It goes through a journey with Braydon and his family before Bogart their new service dog enters their home. We will see the potential impact that the dog has on Braydon and his family. Can Bogart do what seems impossible for everyone else? Can he penetrate Braydon's closed off world and open him to ours? Similarly we follow Ezra's family who is hoping that their community school will accept Quinn their service dog as part of Ezra's classroom. We examine the school and the principal as he navigates through the challenges of bringing a dog in to the school. If Quinn is accepted the film will then focus on how this dog will not only impact the behaviour of Ezra but the effect that Quinn will have on the entire school.
