The Florida Highwaymen are a group of loosely artists based in Fort Pierce Florida. The black artists created Florida landscapes and sold them door to door as decorative art in the 1960's and 1970's. The artists were led by a young entrepreneur named Alfred Hair who started an art assembly line and sold paintings throughout Florida. The Highwaymen Legends of the Road reveals the inspirational founders of the Highwaymen art movement.
