Set against a striking backdrop of Siberian Tigers in the Far East a crashed American pilot is unjustly imprisoned as a spy. Seven years later he is released to a life of exile and forced to wed a strong but inwardly scarred young woman - one of thousands Stalin had cruelly culled from the streets of Moscow and shipped aboard the Trans-Siberian Railway to where they were forced to become wives of hardened prisoners released from the infamous Gulag. As this man and woman struggle to carve out a life together in a hostile and inescapable frontier settlement their hardened hearts collide showing no trust or caring for one another - until a powerful Siberian Tiger becomes the force that unites them in love.
