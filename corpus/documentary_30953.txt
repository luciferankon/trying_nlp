The Australian Government sends back asylum seekers it doesn't think are refugees. International law says people shouldn't be sent to unsafe locations. But the Australian Government never finds out what happens to the asylum seekers they don't want. So a determined Australian with a passion for justice has made it his mission. A Well-Founded Fear is the moving story of Phil Glendenning's search for the asylum seekers Australia rejected. The film follows him as he travels through Afghanistan Syria Turkey Iran and Canada.
