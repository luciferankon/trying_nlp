Lost Forever examines our rich and diverse American film heritage. "There are many reasons why a title may be placed on the [National Film] Registry but most important is that it has been important to the American people in the 100 year history of film" says Gregory Lukow who is head of the Library of Congress' National Audio-Visual Conservation Center. Lost Forever reveals our rich and diverse American film heritage and shows us how preservation saves both our cultural heritage and our individual memories.
