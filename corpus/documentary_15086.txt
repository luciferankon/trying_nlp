Five Finnish sex workers tell us about their work. In re-enacted interviews they walk us through the process of selling and buying sex. For them sex work is above all just work: sometimes boring sometimes fun sometimes interesting sometimes hard - but always autonomous. Yes the fear is always present they say but it is neither the clients nor the law enforcement they fear. Their greatest fear is us the others - and the stigma they so readily are branded with.
