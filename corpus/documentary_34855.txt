The analysis of DNA sequences reveals the genetic heritage of modern humans. Using genetic evidence scientists established that modern humans (Homo sapiens) originated from Africa. As groups of modern humans dispersed from Africa they adapted to different environments around the globe. Genetic variations in human populations account for these adaptations which continue to play a role in our lives. Examples of adaptations include what we choose to eat what we are able to digest and how susceptible we are to certain diseases.
