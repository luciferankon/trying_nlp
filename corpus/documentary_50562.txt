A film about a church organ family harmony and something even more difficult: faith. Concepts that are more or less basic through which there is an attempt to explain something so profound as it is ineffable: the director's sisters suddenly convert to Catholicism and the filmmaker tries to grasp what is behind this personal transformation mechanism. Intelligently dismounting the classic format of the interview documentary (don't forget the title's play on words Converso also comes from the verb to converse) the director sits on a chair that becomes a confessional of others and his own asking questions in front of a mirror that is none other than the mirror of the house. It is a family film with a personal search and a huge cinematographic question: If the Holy Spirit enters our home is it possible to make a film on it?
