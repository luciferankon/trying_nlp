Dr. Min Ki Seo went to Blue Island to fulfill his deceased girlfriend's last wish to find the single mother and her little girl who was infected by HIV and to apologize to them on her behalf as she had unknowingly given the girl tainted blood when she was being treated at the hospital. Lee Young Shin the single mom was having a hard time caring for her grandfather who has Alzeimer's and keeping her daughter's HIV condition a secret while teaching her how to live with it. Min Ki Seo was an arrogant person who looked down on people and in meeting Lee Young Shin who accepted her fate and tried to make the best of it despite all odds he slowly changed for the better and became a warm and caring person. When life throws you curveballs the way you react to it and live your life defines the person that you are. Lee Young Shin (Gong Hyo Jin) certainly doesn't have an easy life. She is a single mom raising her 8-year-old daughter Bom (Seo Shin Ae) while taking care of her senile grandfather (Shin Goo) who is always wandering off. Bom is HIV-positive but Young Shin makes a game of teaching her to manage her condition without her knowing about it while also keeping it a secret from the small island community of Pureun-do ("Blue Island").
