Into an abandoned insane asylum pass six individuals who are about to discover its terrifying secrets and come face to face with its blackest horrors... Sleaze photographer Roger Neale and three beautiful models take up residence in a reportedly haunted old building - an ideal location for Neale's photographic "study in terror." But their project is abandoned when he discovers a secret passageway leading to a blood-splattered dungeon ... and into a supernatural world where pain and evil await.
