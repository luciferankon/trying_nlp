ROCK THE ROAD is a unique travel show where American rocker Ryan records an entire rock album in 12 unique locations scattered ALL OVER THE WORLD. In fact we treat music as the background for adventures of an unpretentious vocalist. In every country Ryan has to compose a song with a local band. He doesn't know the band and can expect everything. Ryan has to experience the ROOTS OF TRADITION and feel like one of the inhabitants because only after understanding them is he ready to compose a real song about the country he is visiting. Our host is different than a typical travel show host. As befits a rock-n-roll man Ryan drinks whiskey and tries local beverages. ROCK-N-ROLL isn't exactly music in fact it's a state of mind. It exists in every culture and it means freedom unity and joy of life! Every episode finishes with a SHORT CONCERT in which Ryan plays the new song for the locals.
