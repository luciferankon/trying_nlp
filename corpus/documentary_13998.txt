'Chris Tarrant (I)' (qv) stars in a special Christmas edition of the show. He embarks upon an epic journey across Scandinavia starting from the South-West coast of Norway. Chris travels to the Norwegian capital Oslo via a blizzard-prone mountain region that once doubled as the ice planet Hoth in the film _Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)_ (qv). He then heads to Stockholm where he tours around the Swedish capital on its newly restored tram system. Chris and his film crew then cross over into Finland to visit Rovaniemi which is known as the home town of Santa Claus. Chris also spends a very chilly night in an ice hotel and then boards a huge iron-ore train travelling through ice snow and darkness towards his final destination back in Norway Narvik.
