This is a story of a village that lives ahead of its time. The village of the future is on the Balkans Bulgaria and has the profound name "Deep Valley". There is a twice-restored church in the village a school with a kindergarten computer club two studios for arts and crafts a tennis court; it is frequently roamed by foreigners summer house dwellers even film-makers. There are a few things missing however. "God Given Home" was the ancient name of the village. What has forced its inhabitants in the course of time to disparage the metaphor implied in its name so that they should not find their nice shelter quite deep any more even for a valley? Is the answer hidden in the way people were living there or is that just an outcome of their creative humor? Along with the arguing and snickering people of the village the film also has to find the answer to that and many other questions. Such as - what has already been given to us have we really taken it? No matter how we would look at the everyday life of a Bulgarian village nowadays at the people there one thing is clear - we all have been launched from one and the same micro-space and that is nothing more but a tiny universe - all we need is there and it has always been. The way it is. And so much the better perhaps. Because this might well be "the universal" village.
