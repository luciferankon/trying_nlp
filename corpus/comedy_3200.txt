Harry Novak brings us a obscure but entertaining tale of the coming of age of a farmer's daughter Moonbean (Terry Gibson) a red-head busty country bumpkin who is the town's whore. She is constantly spied on by her younger sister Pretty Patty (Peggy Church) who masturbates after seeing her sister's sexual encounters. The ladies in this movie are all on the voloptuos side it is a soft core but in any decade it would have gotten an X-rating the sex scenes are that explicit. The lucky guy is Jasper who gets to do all the ladies in the movie including a hard to believe overdeveloped 15 year old hitchhiker (who would make any guys quickie hall of fame). The movie has erotic moments and is funny. Love is in the air at the old pig ranch as the pig keeper's daughter Moonbeam a curvaceous yet naive redhead who still believes in fairy tales patiently waits for her Prince Charming. In the meantime however without any inhibitions Moonbeam is determined to put her charms to good use and drive all the local boys crazy while on the other hand her timid but hot-blooded virgin cousin Patty seems to be having some trouble soothing her unattended sweet spot and finding the man of her dreams. As a result Moonbeam's mother Mrs Swyner is highly concerned about the future of her daughter because at the ripe age of 19 she is still an unwed country girl in contrast to Mr Swyner who strongly believes that when the time is right the proper man will come and knock on their door. When a travelling salesman of perfumes and lingerie is allured by sweet little Moonbeam the opportunity arises and the desperate mother will have no other choice but to come up with a fast action plan for the sake of Moonbeam. Is he her Prince Charming?
