A tunnel without end is a mixture of several layers of the film Collapse and Desire (also Pedro Lacerda) where we see two intersecting lines a figurative and abstract other. The trance that occurs in this mixture is accompanied not only as ornamental but rather sentimental music of the Chilean experimental music band Por Ejemplo. Por Ejemplo makes a sound distressing and deep where the trance and deformity of the sound was transformed into a living experience fear. the video takes us on a hypnotic way this lived experience thus becoming a pilot show about what is living in a constant internal collapse.
