Joe and his wife Dionne have had yet another bad crop for their winery. Faced with the prospect of losing the family farm Dionne convinces her mother (a witch) to cast a spell upon next year's crop. The crop is such a success that Joe hires some college students to help them harvest. However when a nosy neighbor begins poking around in the fields he finds out more than he bargained for. Now the question isn't how to best harvest the crop it's how to keep from being harvested!
