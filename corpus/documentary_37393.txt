This film from Gary Keys focuses on the amazing saxophonist and arranger Gerry Mulligan. His warm tone on the baritone and his delightful state persona are on full display capturing a live show at Eric's in NYC in 1981. From his arrangements and playing on Miles Davis' Birth of the Cool to his quartet with Chet Baker Mulligan will always be associated with Cool Jazz but the music in this film touches on all aspects of Mulligan's 30 plus years of playing. Filmed with Keys' signature style of many close ups and no special effects this snapshot features a master taking a look at his long and storied career with a crack band supporting his every move.
