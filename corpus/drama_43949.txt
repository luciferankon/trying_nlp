A man (played by the filmmaker Nacer Khemir) returns home to Tunisia to bury his mother. After the burial his father gives him an "amana" to be handed to a certain Sheikh named Muhyiddin. Taken by his father's request the man immediately sets out on an epic journey to find the long lost Sheikh and deliver the "amana." Throughout the trip he is guided by a mysterious spiritual master and the many friends of the Sheikh he encounters along the way. As the adventure unfolds we discover the rich life of this Sheikh and his uncompromising love for humanity. For under his teachings different beliefs faiths and ways of life can only converge and become one. The more we learn about Sheikh Muhyiddin the more we understand why he is venerated across cultures and continents. Looking for Muhyiddin is a deeply lyrical odyssey into the soul of Islam through the life and work of one of its beloved mystics: Ibn Arabi.
