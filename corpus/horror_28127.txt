Night people. Thomas Bezug the richest man in the world is a solitary domineering and cruel cripple who hardly can move on his crutches. He dwells a fanatical love for his son whom he holds like a monkey in a cage. His servants are defaced dwarfs. His secretary is trying to steal Bezugs assets. These are the night people.
