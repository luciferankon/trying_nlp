On the last weekend of the season at the Tolliver Bed & Breakfast two young couples arrive for what they thought would be the perfect getaway weekend. Upon arrival the foursome are greeted by what appears to be the loving caretakers Mrs. Tolliver and her daughter Emily. What they don't know is for years Nineteen-year-old Emily Tolliver has led a sheltered and reclusive life at the hands of her abusive mother. Forced to a life of servitude working the bed & breakfast Emily finds herself completely inept in the ways of social interaction. Picking up on Emily's "unique" problems one of the guests James offers some kind gestures and words. A mistake that quickly turns into an "Obsessive Reaction"!
