Gift was shot in the notorious post-industrial lunar landscape of the Wolfen-Bitterfeld district of former East Germany where composer Ulf Langheinrich was born. The area is famous as a great environmental disaster a product of uncurbed open-cast mining and chemical production. Although the devastation belongs to a past era of massive state industry some coal mining continues using vast mobile diggers built in the 1930s. This object lesson in environmental vandalism is now an eco-tourist attraction reflecting the tensions between the old East Germany and the new post-unification Germany. The hypnotic electronic music is constructed and mixed from the industrial sounds recorded on location.
