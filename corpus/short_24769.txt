A light lively lyrical and rhythmically charged entry in my ongoing Cellular Activity series. This footage was shot in the sculpture garden at The Studio-An Alternative Space for Contemporary Art. On a bright and breezy winter afternoon kinetic sculpture by Drew Klotz plays a game of peek-a-boo with highly emotive figurative sculpture by Jo-Ann Brody. All bathed in pure white light. This work is in three movements with transition sections between them.
