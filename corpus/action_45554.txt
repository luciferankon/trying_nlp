Las Vegas PD Detectives Elvis Ford and Jesse Weir resigned from the force (actually Elvis was kicked off) when their lieutenant wouldn't back them up on a bogus slot machine bust involving undercover FBI. They are approached by Caesar's Palace owner Cameron Greene who hires them on as troubleshooters (with the accent on "shooter") to help protect his interests and his customers.
