The director Bernd Schadewald shows the brutal everyday life of the low class generation in the 80s where two youth gangs fight in a war. The "Sharks" and "Council" defend their territories with their lives. Violence hatred and brutality are commonplace soundtracked by thrash metal music. As the conflict grows it comes to the final battle: a man-versus-man duel for Richy (Ralf Richter) the leader of the "Sharks".
