After a lonely night of drinking himself stupid on his 21st birthday Abe swipes a large bundle of cash from his father and goes to find Adam convinced that his father won't forgive him and that the pair have to run to California to avoid the law. Their friendship re-forged in the fire of panic the two barely make it out of the city before their T-bird breaks down in an isolated field in upstate New York. The two refuse to find help preferring to wait until the car's engine "cools down." Both Abe and Adam realize suddenly the fated nature of their seclusion when they discover a solitary grave and a tree that bleeds. The two friends grow mad with cold and hunger until finally the harsh truth of their relationship is revealed.
