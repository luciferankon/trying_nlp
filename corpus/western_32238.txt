Young Dan Light ('Orley Lindgren' (qv)) an orphan is taken in hand by Johnny Wintergreen ('Edgar Buchanan' (qv))hunter of wild horses for selling to the U. S. cavalry. Dan's grief over the death of his parents in an Indian raid is partially eased by his belief that his pet colt Top Kick escaped. Wintergreen takes Dan to a army post where Major Callan ('Hayden Rorke' (qv))welcomes the boy into his home. Several years later Dan ('Ben Johnson (I)' (qv)) now in love with Callan's daughter Caroline ('Martha Hyer' (qv)) joins Wintergreen as a wild horse hunter. Dan is obsessed with the thought that Top Kick escaped the Indians and finds Top Kick now a great white stallion leading a herd of wild horses. A young boy's parents are murdered by Indians and his white colt disappears. Now grown he hunts horses for the Army while he still looks for his horse. Eventually he finds and rides it but it escapes. Finding the Army has bought it and seeing it is being mistreated he rides away on it. Just as he spots an Army troop he thinks is after him the Indians attack them driving away their horses. Left with the only horse he must try and get to the post for help.
