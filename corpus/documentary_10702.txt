Habitat is a film about living in L'Aquila after the earthquake - therefore about earthquake as everyday life and not as breaking news. The film is made in 5 years first working in a tent-camp then in one of the housings built by the government for the homeless. It's the attempt to express and explore the relationship between personal conditions and collective History.
