Joel Shapiro the eminent sculptor was invited by the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris to participate in their project series titled 'Correspondences'. The Orsay is a museum with an exceptional collection dedicated to 19th century art. The aim of 'Correspondences' is to achieve new insights into the complexity of art through confronting some of the museum's masterpieces with ambitious contemporary works. Shapiro initially felt that a wax figure of a dancer by Degas would be an appropriate match for one of his own figures but then opted for Jean Baptiste Carpeaux's 'La Danse' a large-scale manifestation of human sensuality which once adorned the exterior of the Paris Opera. The sculpture had caused a major scandal in its time and is said to have influenced Rodin a generation later. The abandon of Carpeaux's six dancing figures gives a vivid sense of ecstatic human movement. Shapiro achieves the same through abstract means. His bold construction consisting of 20 wooden elements painted in ultra-bright colors evokes a burst of movement that corresponds dramatically to the 19th century work. The camera follows the assembly of the 20 wooden elements into this extraordinary work an example of Shapiro's brilliant use of joinery. It is possibly one of his most spectacular achievements. Shapiro comments as he and two assistants work on putting the sculpture together and placing it in just the right spot in relation to "La Danse." Curators and art historians question him on the issues of this confrontation with Carpeaux. The video represents a unique opportunity to meet the artist and experience a rare art historical event.
