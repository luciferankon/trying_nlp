The blind has no sight but can you see what he sees? "Ashik" is a love story inspired by the true story of Ashik Veysel the prominent master of a thousand years old ashik (folk literature poet) tradition in Anatolia. By hitting the road with an enormous pain of love Veysel matures himself with sorrow and finds "divine love" and at last transforms himself into the "folk poet" Ashik Veysel. "Ashik" which also means "lover" in Turkish language brings the "folk poet" tradition to light a genuine Anatolian cultural memory through the true life story of globally known master Ashik Veysel. In this very first movie of Bilal Babaoglu Sufism and music reunite with sorrow and become a universal power free of language religion race or ethnicity.
