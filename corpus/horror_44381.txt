Gary Brandner's horror novels come to life again in this sequel to "The Howling." A number of vicious murders occur in a small California town after a motorcycle-riding stranger arrives. The gruesome slayings look disturbingly like the work of a werewolf. Meanwhile in another nearby town police are hot on the trail of a killer they believe is a werewolf. This is "Howling" with a country-western angle.
