Te Radar celebrates the true stories of the history that history tried to forget. Many of these tales are so bizarre that they stretch the imagination. But it must be stressed that every one of them is absolutely true. In this new style which Te Radar calls "immersive reconstructions" he wanders through scenes from our history. The re-enactments feature some well-known New Zealanders and a huge cast of enthusiastic amateurs re-enactment groups professional actors and celebrity guests. The series also uses animation and features the odd interview in a fast-paced romp through the rich stories from our bizarre and entertaining past.
