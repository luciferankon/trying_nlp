Esther the sister of a wanted criminal marries the detective who is hunting her brother on the promise that he will halt his pursuit if she marries him although she really loves another man Kenneth. One night her brother Bert is on the run from the police and Esther and Kenneth hide him. It later turns out that Kenneth's father was murdered on that same night and the evidence seems to implicate Kenneth. He is arrested for the murder when he can't account for his whereabouts--because that would let Esther's husband know that she was with Kenneth on that night.
