Believing in your dreams makes the difference. Absolute devotion and passion is what students have at Otterbein College one of the leading and most demanding performing arts schools for theater and music in the US. In their last year at the school seniors have a great opportunity but also a decisive test that shapes their professional future. They must compete against each other at the Showcase in New York. Whoever manages to get an agent will enter the professional world through the front door; the rest will have to keep on fighting as anonymous actors. Four years of preparation are at stake in just one production.
