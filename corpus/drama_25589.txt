Featuring Claude Atkins as Metro Nashville police lieutenant and Jerry Reed as his sidekick this show features many country music personalities and is shot on location at various downtown Nashville sites as well as other locations (including Opryland). This show runs in the same vein as "CHIPs" "Hawaii Five-O" and other police/crime shows only this one seems to center around the music community within Nashville. Nashville country artists of 1977 feature prominently in each one of these episodes.
