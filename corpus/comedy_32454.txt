Four Families from Chekhov's four major plays (Uncle Vanya The Seagull Three Sisters Cherry Orchard) all live under the same roof. Big scandals seize the families and a big fire seizes the town threatening to burn it to ashes. In the end just a few tenants are left in the building which is about to collapse.
