At the height of his fame Albert Einstein was drawn to Pasadena because of the scientific work and groundbreaking developments coming out of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the Carnegie Institute's Mt. Wilson Observatory. It was also a forum to express his views on peace and world affairs. The 47-minute production includes hundreds of photos press headlines newsreel footage and a never-before television broadcast recording of Einstein speaking in Pasadena in 1933 in English as he expressed hope for peace with Germany. The speech is significant because within a few days Adolph Hitler would become German chancellor.
