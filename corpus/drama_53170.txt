Octavia: Elegy for a Vampire is a narrative feature film about a 150 year-old black vampire who is driven to suicide as a result of the apathy in the world. Part poem rock opera and "Brechtian" play - this will not be a traditional horror/vampire genre-film but a cubistic portrait of a woman trying to come to terms with the perennial problems of racism misogyny and the startling lack of consciousness in the world. Throughout her spiritual journey we glimpse various chapters of her life as an activist punk rocker and cleaning woman.
