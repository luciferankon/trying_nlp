On the major social and political issues of our time economist author and columnist Walter Williams is one of America's most provocative thinkers. He is black yet he opposes affirmative action. He believes that the Civil Rights Act was a major error that the minimum wage actually creates unemployment and that occupational and business licensure and industry regulation work against minorities and others in American business. Perhaps most importantly he has come to believe that it has been the welfare state that has done to black Americans what slavery could never do: destroy the black family.The story of Walter Williams' life unfolds through exclusive on-location interviews with Williams and many others referencing those turbulent discriminatory events of the 1960s that so influenced his thinking and his life.
