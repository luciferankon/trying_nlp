Being the middle brother was always a hard difficult business. Paul of course is no exception: his elder brother is literally allergic to his presence and his little sister keeps on chasing him in order to catch him in something and subsequently accuse him to their mom. But when one day he finds his mom is not only indifferent but quite rude to him well... that is simply too much! Suddenly he decides to teach everyone a lesson... a lesson that unexpectedly turns into a rather hard lesson for him.
