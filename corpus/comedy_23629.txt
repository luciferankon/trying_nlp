In a private nursery school in the north of England happy childhoods are made. To be a care worker or 'Auntie' is to spend your days raising other people's children. However it's a woman's world and when the arrival of a new male Auntie threatens to scupper the norm the comfortable dynamic changes. The nursery becomes a place where problem toddlers pale in comparison to problem parents; where sentimentality distracts from reality and where seeking what's best for the children often results in comedic situations.
