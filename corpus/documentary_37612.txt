Waiting as a condition in which people spend a large part of their lives is the central theme of this narrative film. The lives of seven women of various ages who do not know each other intersect for a brief period of time. They are linked by one place - the waiting room at the main railway station - where each one of them in deep contemplation is looking for something or someone different.
