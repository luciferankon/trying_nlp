Dancer choreographer and Dancing on Ice Judge Jason Gardiner steps way out of his metropolitan comfort zone for 6 days and nights on a desert island. The sights and smells of the tropics propel him back to his childhood in Australia and the bullying that built up the resilience that ultimately helped him to the peaks of his profession. At first faced with the chaos of a raw untouched wilderness his Obsessive Compulsive Disorders threaten to engulf him as do a series of tropical storms that grind him down. But inspired by a rainbow his mood and fortunes improve dramatically by the end he is vowing to swap his ordered home life for more wilderness adventures.
