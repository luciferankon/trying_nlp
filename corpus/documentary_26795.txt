The photographer Pavel Stecha created a substantial part of his work during the twenty-year "normalisation" period in Czechoslovakia. He was photographer and sociologist a chronicler of the everyday life of Czech people: capturing the socialist "serf" the inhabitant of a prefab apartment the cottager and the classic do-it-yourselfer. His photographic cycles recorded eerie and almost objective data on life in the 1970s and 1980s.
