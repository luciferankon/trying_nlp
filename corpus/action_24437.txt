When reporter Steve Roberts acts on a call from his good friend Dr. Charlie Venco urging him to leave Seattle and report on a hot scientific story in Bulgaria he ends up in a world of disappearance death and deception. It begins with Dr. Venco's suspicious death and funeral where he meets Alexa Campos a beautiful associate of the doctor's. A romantic liaison between Alexa and Steve is thwarted by local thugs and military police who are all after the meddlesome Roberts. Roberts discovers what he should not - that the supposed blood research is in fact the development of a 100% addictive drug "Blue Mist" - and that Charlie was in on the whole deal with the Russian Mob. Roberts and Alexa must find a way out: their only hope being some pretty quick thinking and the best martial arts to ever hit Bulgaria.
