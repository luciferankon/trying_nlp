At the Texas/Mexico frontier during the Civil War Colonel Greyson was accused of embezzling $ 500000 that he was to deliver to the Confederate command. In fact he was betrayed by four officers who accompanied him and robed the money. When a young man reveals to be Bill Greyson the son of the colonel he is about to be lynched by the infuriated and wrongly informed citizens. El Charro the leader of a Mexican gang tells the real story to Bill and helps him in his revenge plan: to identify and eliminate the four men who are now respected - and wealthy - citizens. El Charro expects the naive young man to be happy to rehabilitate his family name and he will outsmart him and take the money. A public statement rehabilitates Bill alright and the money comes into the pockets of El Charro. Does crime pay?
