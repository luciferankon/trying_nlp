This is the remarkable story of a K through 12 school on Chicago's impoverished high crime West Side that has been sending 100% of graduating seniors to four year colleges and universities for 30 years. More than half of them are accepted by tier one schools and the class of 2008 was awarded more than $4.5 million in college scholarships. Providence St. Mel is a school that has completely escaped America's educational crisis.
