This Columbia Screen Snapshots entry (production number 4858) is strictly a photo-op of scenes where various performers show up at premiers of their current film ( Ronald Reagan and Doris Day)or married performers out on the town (Virginia Mayo and Michael O'Shea) and somebody schilling for Columbia films (Dick Haymes) and the majority of the listed cast have no scenes with the rest of the people seen. A pity since some of the players and people seen here represent the valley-to-the-peaks spectrum of the Hollywood political scene from the far left Democrat (Dore Schary) to the always-testing-the-wind middle (Frank Sinatra) to the Republican right (Ronald Reagan and George Murphy) to the out-of-sight right (Cecil B. DeMille) who still hasn't paid his one dollar union fee so he could be a performer on radio. Some interacting among those present would have made some interesting footage politically speaking.
