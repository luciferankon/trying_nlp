Family ties. Paul is an artist his current project is to take photos of the faces of men during orgasm. He lives with Martial his lover. His sister Camille who's running the family business takes Paul to the hospital to see their father who is dying. Paul hasn't seen him in six years and all his life has believed his father thinks he's ugly and perhaps not even his child. There's no deathbed reconciliation but subsequent exchanges of Paul with Martial and with Camille bring opportunities for growth and change to this temperamental and self-pitying young man.
