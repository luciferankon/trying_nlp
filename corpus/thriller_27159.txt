On the eve of the elections in Russia there's an outbreak of a mysterious disease. The British are curious to find out what's going on so they need to send someone. An official knows someone--Jason Monk an American agent who worked deep cover in Russia during the Cold War. He approaches Monk who initially refuses till he tells Monk that he can help him settle some old scores and to see his daughter whom he left when he was pulled out. So Monk goes and makes contact with an old friend and a Russian policewoman. They learn that someone is trying to manipulate the election. A former US Operative who lived in Russia in his earlier years and had been married there with a child comes out of retirement to face down a former enemy now running as a candidate for President in modern Russia. Working with a Russian policewoman they work to uncover a plot to use biological weapons against certain factions of the Russian people to commit genocide. The virus would also be released in other populations but would be treated making the candidate a hero. A side plot has the agent being reunited with his long lost daughter.
