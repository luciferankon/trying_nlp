In a few months time 23 year old Monique will graduate from university. After all the hardship she longs to be free at last to go out and date and become a Bollywood-star. Her father has something else in mind: he wants her to give up dancing find a good Hindu man and get married like her two older sisters. Parental opposition to what she wants is fuelled by a secret that has been haunting the family for years. Her inner conflict is expressed in her diary and in the Bollywood musical where she plays a leading role. But time is running out: will she give in to the pressure of her environment or will she follow her heard with the risk of losing a part of it.
