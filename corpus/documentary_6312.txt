On any street in any city anywhere in the world there are murders rapes stabbings riots and stray bullets flying hitting innocent children just for crossing on the wrong side of the street. There are no rules only life that is fired at you point blank. To the average man stepping into a boxing ring or cage in front of thousands of screaming fans could be a little intimidating. But the reality is unlike the streets these men have taken great lengths to prepare and learn the art of self defense as well as a brutal offense. There are no guns or knives no unfair numbers drugs or alcohol; no sexual abuse or racial hatred just two men with gloves a referee and honor. Inside this gladiator's arena there has always been a state of grace in the art of combat and no shame in victory or defeat. Just "Put your money where your mouth is and take the consequences." "The Safest Place On Earth" for Gary Stretch has always been inside those ropes. A place where truth is found and history made. The "The Safest Place On Earth" gives an inside view of that sacred place where few men dare to tread.
