Palace Hotel is a portrait of a colourful woman who knows what she wants. She loves her work her hotel and her guests and her hotel is her reason for living. The high point of every year is the big Hultsfred Rock Festival. All winter and spring Maja looks forward to the week of the festival when the hotel is packed with guests.
