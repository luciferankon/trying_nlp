In this Flemish Talk-Show format former beauty queen (Miss Belgium) and sexology graduate Goedele Liekens and VTM news journalist Kris Borgraeve host a discussion with live audience of recent controversial deeds or utterances of various invited celebrities (usually politicians or media people) who thus get a 'right of rebuttal' (hence the Dutch title).
