In Milan there is a historical monument that is special and one-of-a-kind: it is called Casa Verdi and it is the old folks' home for musicians that was created and funded by Giuseppe Verdi in 1899 "which will gather and maintain people involved in the Musical Arts who are Italian and in a state of poverty." Today almost sixty people live in its frescoed rooms - musicians opera singers classical ballerinas orchestra directors - and can dedicated themselves to their passion without the worries of daily life.
