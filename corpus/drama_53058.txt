Anne Buridan is about thirty years old and likes challenges. Her last challenge is to make a movie on May 68. It's a challenge not only because she will be forced to face a story that is not hers but specially because her new boyfriend Blaise doesn't understand this idea even more he hates people that have participated at this event. Anne Buridan is a methodical person and even a bit obsessive. Nothing and nobody will make her turn away from her project. She starts to meet people that were figures of that period. She will start evidently with a woman Marianne who speaks amongst others of Jean-Pierre Lucciani. The name is not unknown to her because it's the same as Blaise's. She will go see him right away. Jean-Pierre is Blaise's father alright. She goes back home and keeps the secret from Blaise. Anne Buridan just lost without knowing it control over this situation. She will need time and many encounters to accept the evidence : through other's stories one chases what builds us.
