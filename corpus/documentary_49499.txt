Finding Ali unveils the occupation of Afghanistan the logical development of mistrust disappointment and rage from ordinary Afghans against the U.S.A. and the Nato. They were promised peace and development but were given a brutal "War against Terror". Will Ali still be as open-hearted and hopeful as he was when he was nine years old? Is he still alive? Being welcomed with open arms by the Afghans a decade ago the filmmaker now experiences an overwhelming feeling of rejection painfully culminating in a roadside attempt on his life. Without sentimental trickery Finding Ali brings you closer to understanding the people enduring life in Afghanistan.
