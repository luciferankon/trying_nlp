During a drunken meander through his quaint Canadian town Gord an aging electrician on the cusp of divorce and well into the crescendo of his mid-life crisis literally stumbles upon a cohort of young DIY documentary filmmakers. His liquor induced bravado and monetary promises soon find him the new subject of their avant-garde fly on the wall filmography. Now both documentarians and Gord himself are subject to the whims of his game of escalation in a misguided attempt to win back his wife. When Gord's scheming leads to him faking his death the line between filmmakers and accomplices become blurred and the group's morality comes into question. Can a man plummet into his own ill-conceived rabbit hole and make it out the other end in one piece? And does filming it truly constitute art?
