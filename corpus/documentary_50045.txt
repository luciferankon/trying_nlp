In November 2000 Alan and Pam Skuse left their home on the Sunshine Coast of Australia to volunteer at an orphanage for twelve months in Tapachula in Chiapas a coastal city at the base of an extinct volcano. Little did they know that the organization they signed on with would closed after six months leaving the Skuses with a choice: to return to Australia or take on the overwhelming challenge of caring for the remaining children on their own. Pam and Alan lacked resources and critical support but dreamed of creating a true refuge in place of a cold institution or worse the existing vacuum. In this coastal city with no other wave riders Pam and Alan set out to create a unique surf community dreaming of hope for children who otherwise had none. Surfing here is when children who suffered the unimaginable forget the past and just be in the moment.
