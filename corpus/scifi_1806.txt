A small hunting party moves through a section of backwoods forest. Three local businessmen decked out in their best hunting garb are being led down a trail by a slender man in ratty clothes. Brown flashes are seen through the underbrush then explodes as an animal squeals and the flash of brown fur grunts and snorts. The brown flash bolts towards the men. They have been targeted and are being taken out one by one.
