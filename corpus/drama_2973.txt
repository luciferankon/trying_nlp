The year is 1987 and Japan is just reaching the peak of its economic success. Eighteen-year old Yonosuke Yokomichi arrives in Tokyo from Nagasaki. Ordinary in every way possible he lives in a suburb far from the excitement of the big city and commutes to a university in the center of Tokyo. During his first days at school Yonosuke befriends Ippei Kuramochi and Yui Akutsu. Soon after he joins the Samba club and spends his leisure time learning to dance. In the Samba club Yonosuke meets Kato who turns out to be gay. Together they take a driving class where Yoko a rich girl shows interest in Yonosuke. But he hardly notices her advances; he is infatuated with party girl Chiharu an older woman he met by chance. Parallel to the depiction of this year of ordinary college life the characters are shown sixteen years later in the year 2003. However missing from these scenes is Yonosuke who is said to have become a cameraman after college. After learning of Yonosuke's death Yoko receives an envelope from his mother. The photos in the envelope - with the words "For Yoko's eyes only" written on it - captured the beauty and the "miracle of chance" those untroubled days enjoyed.
