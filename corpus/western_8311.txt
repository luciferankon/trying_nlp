As a child Bill witnesses the murder of his family by four robbers. Fifteen years later he embarks on his revenge. During his quest he crosses paths with Ryan an ex-con who wants the money the robbers owe him. The gunmen who killed five defenseless people made one big mistake. They should have killed six! John Phillip Law lives for one purpose - to avenge the massacre of his family by the four bandits who occupy positions of authority in the new "civilised" West. Now fifteen years later he learns that one of the gang (Lee Van Cleef) is being released from prison and is seeking the men who framed him. Together they form an unholy alliance - a dynamic duo combining raw untamed youth and the experience only a master gun-fighter can offer in the Wild West.
