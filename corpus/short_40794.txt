The film started out as a simple story about materialism. The plot originally written around an elderly lady with a terminal illness and a carer who is accused of theft. This story line was feeling a little too morbid as it was decided that the central message may be overtaken with the emotion of the situation. This plot was "tamed" to allow a more central message centered around a young girl this worked out very well as children act well as representing all our inner and innocent thoughts and drives.
