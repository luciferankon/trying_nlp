Pendle Hill in Lancashire is one of Britain's most haunted locations and a draw for thousands of tourists every year. Television historian Simon Entwistle himself a renowned expert in the Pendle Witch phenomena brings to life the 400 year history of the Pendle Witches the hill itself and devilish dogs with glowing red eyes in this compelling new documentary. Using actors dressed in authentic 17th century clothing to accurately reconstruct the initial arrests together with Simon's engaging storytelling and travelogue techniques we uncover the true story of the arrest and executions and question whether the Pendle Witch trials were in fact one of this countries first fully documented miscarriages of justice in English Law. After setting the historical scene we hand over to award-winning broadcaster Roy Basnett and a team of respected paranormal investigators from Pathfinder P.I. as they make their way up Pendle Hill to a barn reportedly haunted by a number of very restless and disruptive spirits. What was to follow over the next 24 hours would have far-reaching consequences for all involved.
