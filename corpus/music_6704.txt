The band was at the forefront of jazz/rock fusion in the 70s and were formed by a former Miles Davis sideman in this case the great Chick Corea. Return To Forever hit their commercial and artistic peak with a string of albums in the mid-seventies featuring the line-up of Chick Corea on keyboards Stanley Clarke on bass Al Di Meola on guitar and Lenny White on drums. In 2008 this classic line-up reunited for their first tour in 25 years and proved that their musicianship and the chemistry within the band were as strong as ever. This concert was filmed at Montreux in July 2008 with the bonus tracks being filmed in Clearwater Florida later the same month. After a quarter century apart the core line-up of the jazz quartet Return to Forever--Chick Corea Lenny White Stanley Clark and Al Di Meola--reunited for a world tour in 2008. This remarkable concert film captures the foursome on stage at Montreux playing bewitching renditions of "Vulcan Worlds" "Sorceress" "Romantic Warrior" and many others.
