A one-hour celebration of Anais Nin's ground-breaking diaries this special programme brings the influential author's voice to the fore in a way not seen before on television. Shivani Kapur and Lucy Cohu star as Anais in dramatisations of different periods of her life while Alix Wilton Regan plays the young polar-necked reporter Leah who helps uncover Nin's story. The drama is punctuated with commentary from high- profile fans such as writer and broadcaster Rowan Pelling. Fascinating and racy this documentary brings her work to life for a whole new generation.
