Quality Time centers on four college friends who kept their sophomoric ways in suspended animation throughout their 20s and are now succumbing to reproduction. It's an "untraditional" fatherhood comedy about the constant push and pull between the dudes they used to be and the men they are attempting to be. Each week viewers will be dropped into a new and uncensored adventure with Broken Lizard's Paul Soter Kevin Heffernan Steve Lemme and Erik Stolhanske squarely in the middle of chaos. Filming is set to begin January 2015.
