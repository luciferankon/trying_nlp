Three Barbecues is a blackened comedy about three barbecues in one day. The movie follows the same eclectic time warped characters during this afternoon into evening stretch of side dishes and light beer. The hosts provide entertainment for any appetite. Vera and Willie Wong are an Asian duo that serves hot dogs of all kinds and celebrates Americana with a splash of Red Light and Brew! During this barbecue there will be a musical "Parade of Side Dishes" that has all the ladies doing a choreographed departure from the kitchen to the backyard.
