Born Robert Clark in Newcastle Indiana in 1928 he changed his name in the mid-1950s when he moved to New York City as a way of honoring his home state and of assuming a new identity. He first lived on Coenties Slip where his neighbors included Ellsworth Kelly Agnes Martin and Jack Youngerman then in a loft building on the Bowery until he moved to Maine in 1978. He now lives and works in a former Odd Fellows Lodge on Vinalhaven Island. This hour-long portrait combines archival footage of Indiana at work in his studio with photographs interviews poetry prose and contemporary scenes to create a visual autobiography in the artist's own words and images.
