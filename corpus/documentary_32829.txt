World War II was a great chapter not just for the United States but for nations on every corner of the globe. From periods of triumph to periods of sorrow; men and women sacrificed their lives defending not just their homeland but the homeland of others. The generation of that time is considered to be one of the greatest. Those that fought or contributed had different reasons for joining the fight. Some believed it was their duty others took a personal approach. One individual in particular joined to seek something more and in the process experienced both triumph and tragedy. That individual was Private Anthony J. Quagliano.
