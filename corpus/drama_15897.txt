The film weaves the tale of Louie B. (Tim Brazzil) a hapless cowboy who thinks the world would be a better place if strangers would kiss each other more often. After a run-in with a band of crooks headed by Stacey (Mary Crosby) Louie goes blind. He is taken in by Billie Jean - a tough-love prostitute (Daphna Kastner) and her colleagues - who are as gay as they are straight. What follows is a fabulously eclectic look into the life of an East Hollywood Heydy Fleiss-style bordello for the working man whose goal it is to liberate heterosexual social mores.
