A newly hired executive for a multinational corporation Larry Sorenson is kidnapped at gunpoint. The hostage takers send video demands directly to Larry's wife Elizabeth demanding the multinational halt all financial dealings with Europe. If their demands are not met in 12 hours Larry will be executed and other executives and stockholders will follow. This sends the company's stock into a free-fall. Seattle PD Detective Jimmy Kelsoe has his suspicions. It's all too neat. Working closely with FBI Agent Jade Marlo the two soon discover that the whole kidnapping is an elaborate plot to manipulate stock prices for a mafia takeover. As the pieces of the puzzle fall into place Detective Kelsoe and Elizabeth join forces. But Elizabeth soon realizes she has far more in common with Detective Kelsoe than with her missing husband Larry. Kelsoe too realizes his feelings toward Elizabeth have grown beyond professional. With time running out both Kelsoe and Elizabeth must struggle to put their feelings for each other aside in order to save Larry's life.
