In January 2016 a pair of friends set off to shoot a documentary on the refugee crisis. They had no budget and no plan but they did have a yellow van a camera and each other. During the months ahead they would have all their assumptions challenged as daily the first hand experience of looking at the lives of refugees transformed perspectives learnt through the media. From dropping the cameras to help those arriving on the shores of Lesvos to witnessing the closure of the borders of Europe to being arrested in the mountains of the Balkans the journey would transform their lives. In an environment of fear hatred and suspicion in Europe "The March of Hope" is a celebration of everything which makes us human and a challenge in film to the xenophobia growing in modern Europe.
