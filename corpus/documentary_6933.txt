FATHER MOTHER CHILDREN is a great story about family and ageing about caring and being cared for told from perspective of the actors and dancers of the internationally renowned company PEEPING TOM. Life is a stage but what happens when the curtain is about to fall? In their eponymous trilogy Leo (79 and lead actor in 'Father') Eurudike (52 Leo's biological daughter and lead actress in 'Mother') and the rest of the theatre family on and off the stage dwell on the care of and for a family. This documentary follows the culturally eclectic theatrical family on tour around the world and 'peeps' into their personal family stories: their relationships with their own 'Fathers' 'Mothers' and 'Children'. How do they want to grow old? How do they look at the elderly people in their families? And how is their vision conditioned by the culture in which they were brought up?
