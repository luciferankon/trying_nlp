Frenching The Bully is co-written by Florence Keith-Roach and Freddy Syborn. Florence likes disco Pink Narcissus and dressing as a young Miss Marple. Freddy humiliates himself in public whether he likes it or not. She is an optimist and extrovert; he is a pessimist and creep. All they have in common is a shared passion for the Seattle grunge band The Gits. It's the story of long succession of put-downs botched trysts and spiked ros√©-drenched dreams of artistic success. Funny woozy sad and a bit creepy like the feeling of waking up next to your best friend on a night bus terminating somewhere weird in Zone 6 having singularly failed to mack on anyone and in that peaceful lull just before the comedown crushes you
