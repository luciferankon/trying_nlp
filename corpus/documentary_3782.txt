Filmmaker Rod Pitman tracks history as auteur Jim Morrison creates his first student film with roommate poet-photographer Max Schwartz. As a showcase for the long lost Morrison fiction film narrative "First Love" Pitman's OBSCURA chronicles the events surrounding a rare slice of American silent cinema. Shot in 1964 "First Love" is the only surviving work of Jim Morrison as a University of California Los Angeles film student in the mid-sixties.
