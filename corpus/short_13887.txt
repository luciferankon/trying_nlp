Baumzelt is a young man low on money and even lower on perspective. One day he he wants to buy a used wash-horse. When arriving at the given address the sellers are both dead and policemen are around everywhere. Baumzelt is fascinated by a raven in a cage. He forgets about the wash-horse and takes the raven with him. What Baumzelt doesn't know is that this is a very special raven.
