On a rural road winding through autumnal trees a solitary cyclist heads down hill; he seems to resent it when he has to steer to the side to let a convertible go past. Several hundred yards ahead the car stops for a red light and the driver lights his companion's cigarette. She smokes leans over to kiss the driver as her hand with the cigarette extends beyond the car's window. The cyclist approaches grabs the cigarette and looks back at the car's passengers with a sneer. He should have known however that smoking can be hazardous to your health.
