An interstellar voyage is the framework for a narrative of a journey through fantastic landscapes. The story is set at Tormance an imaginary planet orbiting Arcturus which in the novel (but not in reality) is a double star system consisting of stars Branchspell and Alppain. The lands through which the characters travel represent philosophical systems or states of mind through which the main character Maskull passes on his search for the meaning of life.
