India's prosperous Green Revolution was led by Punjab a state in northern India famous for its lush rice fields and wet fertile soil. But as farmers are conned into buying more and more pesticides herbicides and fertilisers that they don't need which demand often ten times more water the water table is sinking at an alarming rate. Punjab's water has been poisoned by the chemicals and the farmers poison their bodies with opium helping them to work longer and harder. Loans from a middleman are taken out with extortionate interest rates that are impossible to pay back. As a result hundreds of Punjabi families are left without a father husband or son as more and more farmers cave in under the pressure and drink their own chemicals to end their lives. In their own harrowing words Indian farmers tell us the price they pay for the rice on your plate. When the land body and mind are polluted by pesticides drug addiction and suicide in the pursuit of agricultural self-sufficiency we ask was the Green Revolution worth it?
