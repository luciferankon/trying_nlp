Over the course of the last 3 years Cinga productions has been following and documenting the lives of three of the most notorious train surfers in Soweto: Bitch Nigga Lefa and Mzembe. We have followed them on to the top of trains hurtling through Soweto. We have followed them into the heroin dens of Hilbrow and Jails with names like Sun City We have watched their lives fall apart. And we have watched them battling to piece them back together again.
