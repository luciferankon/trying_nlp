On 9th of November 1983 two Australians Kevin Barlow and Geoff Chambers were arrested at Penang Airport in Malaysia carrying 179 grams of heroin a crime which in Malaysia carries a mandatory sentence of death. Dadah Is Death (A Long Way From Home) is the true story of Barbara Barlow's desperate attempt to save her son from the hangman's rope - a courageous effort that involved impassioned pleas to President Reagan The British Prime Minister and even the Pope. By July 1986 this international struggle had seemed to reach a hopeless conclusion and all that was left was a mother's love for her son.
