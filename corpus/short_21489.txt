It's an isolated fishing village in winter. A woman lives alone in a store near the railroad. A younger woman has given up hope of receiving phone calls and is always the one to make calls. This is where the two lives intersect when the younger woman uses the phone in the store. When she leaves the older woman returns the phone to its place as the fragrance of their unchanging lives mingles with the ocean breeze.
