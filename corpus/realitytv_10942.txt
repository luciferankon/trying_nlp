Candice and her crew remodel homes for people. They usually start by demolishing the part of the home that will be remodeled and after construction work is over they decorate the space. They combine sequences of the construction work with personal life activities that may involve the home owners. The series is light hearted and does not provide too many details in terms of interior design as other shows do.
