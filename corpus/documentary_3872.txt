The KORGIS hit the big time with their worldwide Hit Everybodys Got To Learn Sometime which had followed hard on the heals of their very first Hit Single If I Had You. This first ever Korgis film is a mixture of stunning live sessions recorded in 2005 as well as original promo videos rounded of with interviews with all band members to create the Off The Leash Korgis documentary which delves into membership of Stackridge as well as Andys time with Tears For Fears James recording session at Abbey Road with George Martin and Johns performance on the Tears For Fears album Elemental. Classic Pop music.
