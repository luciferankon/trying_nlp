Suge Knight is fighting for his life. He has been charged with murder and attempted murder. This film will put his current legal trouble all in perspective. It all began on September 7 1996 - the night he was riding in the car with Tupac Shakur when shots rang out. He was targeted along with Tupac for murder that night and they have been after him ever since. If they can't kill him they want to banish him to the nethermost parts of the American Prison System where they can silence him once and for all.
