A century ago Robert Louis Stevenson author of Treasure Island and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde which made him famous brought a donkey called Modestine and set out to walk with her across 100 miles of the wild Cevennes mountains in Southern France. And so his Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes was conceived. John Castle re-enacts the journey with a descendant of Modestine.
