Created in collaboration with the NHL and the NHL Players' Association the seven-episode series will chronicle stories from Canada's most hockey-mad regions. A panel of judges will narrow the field down to 25 communities with viewers selecting which towns or cities will advance to the next round at the end of each episode. Five neighbourhoods will face off in the series finale which will air June 11 in the midst of the Stanley Cup playoffs. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the show was designed in part to reward Canadian hockey fans who remained devoted to the league through its tumultuous 10-month lockout - and to win back those who may have soured on the sport.
