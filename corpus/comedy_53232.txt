Megy a gözös (TRAIN KEEPS A ROLIN') is a colorful countryside comedy. In the small village of Ivaros tucked away somewhere deep in the Hungarian countryside a ceremonial train derails while carrying the Ancestress of Barczika - a relic of great value to both the church and the state. The train falls victim to the bitter prairie vendetta between the station master Janos Bajusz and his predecessor Lajos Korte shunned and ousted from his job and Lajos' son Kazmer. The encounters between station master of the village the corrupt gendarmes guarding the relic and the stowaway Roma family make for a raucously comic adventure.
