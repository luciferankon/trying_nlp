On March 11th 2011 the Yuriage district of the city of Natori in Miyagi prefecture was devastated by the massive earthquake and tsunami. That night the students at Yuriage Elementary spent a frightful night stranded in isolation at the school. Now everyday they are sent back and forth on cramped buses to far away schools. On just such a day four students spontaneously gather at their old alma mater which is now in ruins. On those nostalgic school grounds they discover a mysterious cipher written on an animal hide. The cipher seems to instruct them to collect five stone fragments.
