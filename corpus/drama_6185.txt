Shortly before a rodeo festival week in Yuma County a body is found in the desert. It seems that it's Ria Paris who was assumed to be killed by her husband before he took his own life already 16 years ago - however the cadaver's no that old! Together with his new ambitious colleague Paul McCraw Sheriff Kyle starts to investigate in the old case again trying to avoid shaking up the community of the small town during the celebrations. In the community of Yuma a headless body of a woman is discovered. Grace the coroner tells the Sheriff Kyle that she believes that the woman is Rita a woman who married the town's richest man nearly 16 years ago and who was believed to have been killed by the man who would later kill himself. Now it seems that the coroner knows who she is because the woman wanted an abortion and consulted with her so she examined her and there was something distinctive she saw during the examination. Now what she did was illegal for her to do. So if this ever comes out Grace will be in trouble so Kyle has to investigate without involving her. Now Kyle's boss whom he is constantly at odds with brings in a guy from Chicago Paul to help modernize the department but in reality to try and get Kyle out. They work the case together and Paul starts to respect Kyle while also pursuing a relationship with Kyle's headstrong daughter Elise. And as they investigate it seems that they are stepping on some very big toes and Kyle refuses to involve Grace. But they are on the right track.
