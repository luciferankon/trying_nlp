Today China is waking up as if these four decades of Maoist harshness and austerity had just been a bad dream. Mao is dead long live Mao. His successor Deng Xiao Ping who has been ruling since 1978 is the father of a reform which has brought the most spectacular changes in the History of modern China. Today the model to conform to is the consuming society its rule the race to profit. The economic growth is so overwhelming that it is starting to become frightening for the ruling class itself. The gap between the wages is fearsome and the cultural and moral references are more than dubious. Joining the values of Communism and Capitalism of Asia and the Western world has proved to be a complex and risky task.
