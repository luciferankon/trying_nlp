Ernesto Che Guevara - possibly the single most iconic figure of the 20th century. More than just a handsome face on a million t-shirts he remains a symbol of revolutionary struggle against imperialism and injustice. 50 years ago Che Guevara emerged from the Cuban Revolution as the quintessential guerrilla fighter and eight years later that's how he died. Last Autumn Joe Higgins set out to discover what this man - whose courage and integrity he has always admired - means to the people of Che's homeland today. 40 years after Guevara's death Latin America is in the midst of sweeping political change. After decades of ruthless dictatorships a powerful democratic Left has emerged echoing Che's ideals of unity and independence.

But how much has changed for the people whose freedom he fought and died for?"
