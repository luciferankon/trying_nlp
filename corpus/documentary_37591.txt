A political documentary and model of team work par excellence with the struggles of the Greek people as its theme. It begins with the rebellion of the university students against the junta with the occupation of the Law School in February 1973 and continues with the popular mobilization and the major strikes against the first government of Karamanlis in July 1975. An absolutely committed film that attempts to intensify the political struggle and not just create entertainment from it. An extension of this fighting spirit was also reflected in the way in which this film was distributed. As a rule it wasn't played in commercial cinemas but at political organizations where its creators would discuss the film with the audience.
