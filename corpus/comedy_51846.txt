Berre is trying to make an informative and cultural TV-show about the history of the Vespa a typical Italian product. He invites two friends to go along with him to Italy driving a Vespa and make educative television. These two friends Benji and Jokke actually have 1 main goal: to eat drink and enjoy the trip. There is one other person traveling with them: Haldis. A rather pathetic person who takes care of everything off-screen: transportation where to sleep... By accident they don't make it to Italy but arrive at Spain. Later on they also discover Scotland and Iceland. A great adventure is waiting for them.
