Tandem is a correspondence film and a film experience. Indeed image and sound were made in autonomy on the basis of a script concerned by the analogy between film and train: the image in Épinal (France) and the sound in Montréal (Québec). This script was very precise with construction cues but still let wide parts without indication except for few intentions and for durations. During the year the work moved on the two directors never shared any image or sound but only intentions and durations and never met only communicating by email. At the end of the process image and sound were joined. Only a few modifications were done on synchronization. Made around common intentions image and sound work together in an unexpected and disconcerting audiovisual confrontation wich wouldn't be possible to conceive in a classical production.
