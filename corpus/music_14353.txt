Sugar Ray Five ~ Battle of the Bands Finalists/Winners 1984 - Sugar Ray Five were one of the six finalists and eventual winners of the 1984 Battle of the Bands Competition sponsored by TDK. The competition was held throughout the UK in which more than 1700 bands initially entered. Various Nationwide elimination heats were held in which Sugar Ray Five won each heat outright and were eventual outright winners at the Grand Final which was held at the world famous Hammersmith Odeon (now Hammersmith Apollo) in London in front of a capacity crowd and covered by the BBC. Sugar Ray Five completely annihilated the opposition on the night and ending up gaining 147 of the absolute maximum of 150 points available from the judges. Only ever performing original material the self-penned 7" single 'Lazy Hours' with 'March' on the flip side was released into the British charts the following year which received airplay on principal radio and TV but despite being rapidly tipped by the industry for great heights as a true force to be reckoned with in the mid-eighties music scene the group disbanded less than a year later.
