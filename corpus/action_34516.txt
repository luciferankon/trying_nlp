Gladiator for Rent is a detective/crime drama based on the novel "The Case of the Velvet Claws" by Erle Stanley Gardner. The owner of the private detective agency Ilya Mirsky receives a tempting offer from the wife of media mogul Yeva Lukachyova - he should not allow the leak of compromising information which would deprive Yeva of her multimillion-dollar inheritance. Deciding to take the case Ilya could have hardly imagined that he would have to face a whole series of sophisticated murder and that the result would be in the danger of his own life.
