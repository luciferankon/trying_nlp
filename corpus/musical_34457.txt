The internationally renowned Celtic Irish choral group Anúna - the original vocal group in Riverdance- bridges the gap between classical and popular music with its pure haunting emotional mystical and unusual sound. In a new special the singers musicians and dancers of Anúna perform popular and lesser-known Christmas music and reminisce about their most cherished holiday memories. Taped in front of a live audience over the course of two nights the songs and performances combine dramatic candle-lit sets crystalline voices ethereal costumes and ritualistic movements. Anúna's previous public television special 2007's Anúna: Celtic Originsspawned a national tour and a best-selling CD which remains a presence on the Billboard World Music Charts
