Three guys one dead playwright and 37 plays all in under two hours. In this universally acclaimed theater experience Adam Long (one of the troupe's founding members) Reed Marin and Austin Tichenor manage to compress the complete works of Shakespeare into about an hour and 40 minutes of high-speed over-the-top hilarity. Knowledge about Shakespeare's works is helpful but not at all necessary. All that is needed is time enough to watch and someone to dial 911 in case you pass out from laughing so much.
