Set in the North Pennines Addicted to Sheep is an intimate portrait of a year in the life of tenant hill farmers Tom and Kay Hutchinson as they try to breed the perfect sheep. Through the rain shine sleet and snow we see them toil away against the stunning landscapes of North East England and witness the hard work it takes just to survive. Their three children are growing up close to the land attending a school entirely comprised of farmers' children thoroughly immersed in their remote rural world. While the odds often seem stacked against them the film conveys the importance of a balanced family life and the good humour that binds this tight knit community together. Beautifully observed this heartwarming film provides an insight into the past present and future of a way of life far removed from the high-tech hustle and bustle of modern life allowing us all to experience life on a hill farm without having to get dirty!
