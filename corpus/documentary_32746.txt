Ernest Hemingway is an almost mythical figure. In addition to being an author he is literary work himself - a real rock star ante litteram. Much of his life has been an eternal holiday minutely documented and continues to be a source of inspiration for himself. Wherever there are places that share their quotes: true or presumed. The pictures that portray him are thousands. Hemingway had built a fame as a captain of ventura expressing a strong personality man and myth joining the life lived in the imagination of his characters. It is in this context that his many trips to Italy are included. From the First World War to the advent of Fascism from the Second World War to the Boom Years: both male and female acquaintances relationships with food and wine landscapes loves pleasures and tragedies of life especially in Veneto were fundamental to the writer. Finding how Hemingway was a forerunner of the modern public figure we will also see how he eventually found himself victim to the icon that was sewn on him. Finding its strange and private sides between the mountains and the lagoons of a territory that he loved to the end makes the silence more silent on the fragility of this hard.
