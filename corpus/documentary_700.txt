The spirit of the past came to life as living history actors staged Civil War battles in the fields of southern Iowa. Infantry clashed and rifles rattled. Cavalry swept around the troops at a gallop with revolvers blazing. And nearby up on the ridges artillery thundered and great fireballs shot out the barrels of the big guns. This documentary covered three Civil War reenactments in Iowa held during 2013 - events at Lamoni Corydon and Davis County. It featured the battle scenarios plus much more. The documentary included a portrayal of Abraham Lincoln as he delivered after dinner remarks at the Inn of the Six Toed Cat in Allerton Iowa. It showed a number of other living history portrayals - a blacksmith hammering on an anvil a broom maker a period doctor and a couple of spinners pedaling their spinning wheels. Plus a number of old time musicians were covered playing fiddles banjos and guitars. The film also included a truly unique event - a night fire. Artillery lined up and shot rounds during the dark of night. The big guns spewed fire that resembled a 4th of July explosion. The colors of the rainbow glowed in the dark.
