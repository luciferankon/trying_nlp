Mossadegh & Me is a film about how we remember the 1950s in Iran and the CIA coup that ousted then Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh. In 1979 the Iranian Hostage Crisis shocked the world. The crisis received more non-stop press coverage than any other event since World War II. Americans for the first time asked "Why do they hate us?" As an Iranian-American kid director Gita Saedi Kiely asked that question too. That's when her father told her about Mohammed Mossadegh.
