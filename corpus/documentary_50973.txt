In the summer of 2005 a sensation appeared on domestic social networks in the form of a blog titled "Maja in a brothel." The author of this blog whose nickname was "sexymaja" identified herself as a girl from Belgrade who has just started in the prostitution business. She soon became one of the most popular persona on the web entertaining numerous readers with witty and provocative descriptions of the clients she had met. However after her mysterious disappearance from the scene suspicions were aroused about the identity of this person. The blog community points a finger at a ghostwriter who was allegedly responsible for the entire conspiracy. He admits it but without much hesitation also leads us to its inspiration - a girl who's actually lived through it all.
