South of Beirut Lebanon is a 68 year old refugee camp housing refugees from Palestine Syria and Iraq. Many have lived in this camp their entire lives-- Mariam AlShaar is one of them. Now Mariam has pulled the women of this camp together to do what has never been done before. They started with a small kitchen from a micro-loan. With nearly insurmountable political odds against them-- they look to start the first refugee food truck. Their journey is one of many ups and downs but it is the community that is built their sense of hope and how they see themselves that makes this a moving touching film about their journey. Mariam has been known as 'the crazy lady' and now she will show just how crazy she is.
