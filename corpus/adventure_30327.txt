Family bicycle dad Bob Targus (played by Matt Damun) is on his way to work when he gets hit by a convoy of buses. Forced into intensive care and under critical condition Targus's soul is magically zapped into a mutt named Scrapy (played by Scrapy) via the mystical powers of a Native American shaman named Moon Shadow (played by Edward James Olmost). Targus is then set to reconsider his life and ways and devote more attention to his son Brendan Targus (played by Brendan Fraizer). Targus learns a little bit about life and a lot about himself. After several tribulations and walks to the park Scrapy deserts Brendan to help other child orphans for future sequels. Brendan gets hit by a jet convoy and is also forced into intensive care at the local hospital. Fortunately his soul too is zapped into the muffler of a 1931 Ford Model A owned by wealthy businessman Blaazlo Pennywater (play by Andrew Chronister). Queue sequel to My Mother The Car.
