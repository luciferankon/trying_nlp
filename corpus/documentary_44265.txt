Michael Jackson Interview: The Footage You were Never Meant to See is a response documentary that shows behind the scenes of the controversial TV special by Martin Bashir titled "Living with Michael Jackson". During the months that Martin Bashir took to interview Michael Jackson in his Neverland ranch Michael had his own cameras tapping the interviews next to Bashir's own. This new unedited footage offers a true representation of the interviews very far from the initial broadcast.
