Four outstanding films that are based on three noted authors from Ireland and other countries as well as one original story by the screenwriter for all projects Pamala L. Hall. These books and tales will are beautifully told. One is taken into the visually extraordinary world of many legends and myths and heroic characters. Each film for the big screen will also touch on very timely issues. A site for Legend of the Sidhe is in the works with our designers and more biography on the authors. We are very excited about this world of magic mystery and other worlds. The new Legend of the Sidhe is not connected to author Heather MJL Watson books. It remains under Lionhawk Production domain Legend of the Sidhe.
