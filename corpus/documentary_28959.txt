The second 1978 - 2005 starts at the beginning of the political wave until the more recent personal cinema. However chronological both episodes cover most of the genres themes and periods of Israeli cinema - from the beginning of the Zionist Mouvement to the most personal stories - from commercial to politically engaged directors from the local to the universal.

It attempts to understand to denounce or to explore this complex subjects always searching for the right ethic the right form: to explore or transform its own definition and its place in the world. A History of Israeli Cinema is the result of years of researches studies documentation screening interviews some recorded some to learn to understand to unfold. Actors thinkers producers filmmakers professors critics negotiated to build a narrative that remains fragile and incomplete. It is the process rather than the result that is shared here.
