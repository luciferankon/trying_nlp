'The Newsstand' is about a Elizabeth Willis who's owned a Times Square news stand for almost 50 years. Liz has reason to believe she's the only black woman who owns a newsstand in all five boroughs as well as the oldest person to do so. From with in the tiny stand on 50th and 7th we see Liz Willis interacting with her customers who are also her 'family'. She speaks about her strained relationship with her kids Go-Go dancing in the NYC '80s how she loves her job and other unique observations on a life lived in the city. 'The Newsstand' is part of the FACES docuseries started in 2015 by Josh Ethan Johnson. There are currently 18 shorts any more on the way. FACES explores people and places in with a spontaneous approach to filming and a engaging editing style.
