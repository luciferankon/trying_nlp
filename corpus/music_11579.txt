On Thursday 4th December 2014 Amazon hosted Carols by Kindlelight at London's famous Abbey Road Studios - the first carol concert of its kind. The show was filmed exclusively for Amazon Prime Instant Video. The concert hosted by Steve Jones (US X Factor T4 Let's Dance for Comic Relief) featured performances from Grammy Academy and Brit Award-winning and Multi-Platinum singer-songwriter Annie Lennox; the nation's favourite tenor Alfie Boe; queen of Rockabilly Imelda May; million-selling sporting soprano Laura Wright; 6 x Platinum-selling New Zealand opera trio Sol3 Mio; the No.1 selling classical vocal ensemble VOCES8. Customers selected to attend the event through a competition received a Kindle Paperwhite to e-read carols during the concert and then take home after the event. Using the Paperwhite display the 200 audience members illuminated Abbey Road Studios in a way never seen before. The show also featured readings written by students from East London Arts & Music (ELAM) a new industry academy for 16-19 year olds and read by MyAnna Buring from Amazon's Ripper Street. Kindle Paperwhite used by the artists have been donated to ELAM. Find out more about the event at www.amazon.co.uk/carolsbykindlelight.
