William Winter is one of the most accomplished governors in Mississippi history. Yet his bold plan to reform the abysmal education system and create public kindergarten in the poorest state in the nation met fierce opposition from a state marred by the legacy of slavery and segregation. After multiple legislative defeats Governor Winter called a controversial special session of the Mississippi Legislature in December of 1982 to decide the fate of the reform bill creating an incredible moment in state history. The eyes of the nation looked to Mississippi led by it's most progressive statesman. From his early years growing up in "the most segregated state in the union" to his long career in politics during the rise of the Civil Rights Movement William Winter's story is one of courage and leadership set in some of the most tumultuous times in American history.
