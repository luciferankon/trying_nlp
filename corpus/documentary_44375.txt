Javier and Santiago have been living and working as volunteers in the Cottolengo of Barcelona for more than 20 years. Javier is an energetic and extroverted guy while Santiago is serious and spiritual. But it will only be through the two of them that we will be able to slip into a world invisible to most of us. We hear their voices resounding together with those of the sick people who live at the Cottolengo: a place that seems so remote from our world but which ends up creating in us a sort of trembling a fear which dramatically shakes us up forcing us to wake up.
