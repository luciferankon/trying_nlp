The history of the newspaper El Universal is the very history of contemporary Mexico. It was founded in 1916 with the aspiration of being a modern newspaper in terms of its information services as well as through its high-volume production and distribution. The paper's alliance with President Carranza's regime assigned it another greater task early on: guiding the agitated and violent political life in Mexico through public debate that might lead people to exchange their arms for ideas. Since then and until today The Great Mexican Newspaper has encountered crises of all types world-wide ones national ones and even internal upset. El Universal has known how to maintain the power of that essential vocation of its origins: making journalism an alliance of objective information editorial plurality and technological renovation.
