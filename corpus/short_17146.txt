'The Operator' (Gwendoline Christie) and 'Kadmus' (Johnny Vivash) desire to control 'The Face' (voiced by David Dimbleby) with which The Operator claims they can "control the modern age". They drop it and The Face flies through the sky speaking in an existential and confusing manner before falling into a puddle by the River Thames. It is then retrieved by David Dimbleby who explains that he is participating in a "work of art" by Nathaniel Mellors whilst holding the prosthesis of his own face.
