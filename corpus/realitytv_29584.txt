In May 2007 the town of Greensburg Kansas was leveled by a massive tornado that killed 11 people. A year later families are still living in FEMA trailers and trying to rebuild their homes. Led by carpenter/furniture maker Faber Dewar and designer Doug Wilson the folks behind MAKING IT HOME: GREENSBURG help six such families put the finishing touches on their new houses so that they can move back home.
