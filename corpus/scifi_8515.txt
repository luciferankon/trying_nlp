Aliens from a newly discovered planet called Kepler 186F invade Earth in pursuit for a super-powerful girl apparently half-human half-Alien Rachel (Doreen Rwatooro). She is the strongest human that ever walked this planet and the only human being who has Re-structuring DNA. And still Kepler is dying and they need a new planet. Earth being a lot like Kepler provides the best option. Aliens go ahead to kill every single human they come across and for some they use them as experiments for their scientific attempts to create Alien-Human Hybrids. Now humans have to survive as they defend their country. As a measure the remaining humans divided themselves under the Government into different units each with well-trained operatives. Unit 4 under Captain Stacy Kalunji (Esther Nampewo) has the best crew that can bring the lost hope back to humanity. Ray (Denis Dhikusooka Jr.) a former bodyguard to a celebrity Derrick (Rodney Dhikusooka) a former gym instructor and Martial arts trainer Natasha (Sharon Mutetsi) a model and a victim of their experiments and Amy (Brenda Akankwatsa) a former interrogation Officer. The crew also has a pilot Evans (Samuel Kynes Dhikusooka) and a brain maniac good with computers and technology Palmer (Nina Josephine Akoth). This crew is ready to defend Earth till their last breathe.
