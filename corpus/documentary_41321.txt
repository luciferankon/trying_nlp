Defusing Human Bombs is the incredible story of the Sabaoon School in Pakistan which uses psychology religious scholars and other techniques to undo years of Taliban indoctrination in the hearts and minds of young boys. Filmed over a period of 18 months the film exposes the incredible hardship and violence the boys experienced during their time with the Taliban including abduction brainwashing and aborted suicide missions. Run by the Pakistani Army the Sabaoon School has been a ray of light for families living in the Swat area of Pakistan.
