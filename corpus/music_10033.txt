Town and Country Time was a syndicated music TV series produced in Washington D.C. Initially 52 episodes were filmed for syndication in 1954; based on the series' popularity it became a daily program initially airing on local Washington DC television in 1955 before being picked up in other media markets in 1956. The series featured what critics called "hillbilly music" which today we would consider country bluegrass and western genres. The program gave 'Patsy Cline' (qv) and 'Roy Clark (II)' (qv) both local Virginia artists their first television exposure.
