A group of young boys trying to film a movie get taken by an extremist cult called Met. The cult brainwashes the people to think the way they do a world without laws and regulation. The cult liberates cities from the government and uses young boys to spread chaos across the state by assaulting people who believe otherwise in order to send a message.
