A little girl and her baby sister are playing in the garden. The older of the two wishing to amuse herself in some other way gives the baby some bread and runs off. Pretty soon a number of hungry puppies see the baby eating and make a rush for her. When they jump for the bread the child becomes frightened gets up and attempts to run away but there are too many hungry pups around and before she can get away they snatch the bread from her. It is very humorous to watch the baby's facial expressions from the time the little puppies first appear until she runs away.
