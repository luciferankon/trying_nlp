In this story of adventure (with a touch of magical realism) under the wide open skies and natural beauty of the Southwest Skylar struggles to figure out what it is she wants to do with her life and where to find meaning in it. More than simply a quest to find her way back to her faith Skylar's journey reflects a more universal pursuit to find meaning in life and a certainty in one's purpose. Skylar is granted eight days outside of the convent by the Mother Abbess to venture out on a pilgrimage to the site of her sister's death in the religious town of Chimayo New Mexico. On her journey Skylar is joined by two others also seeking answers to questions in their lives. The gentle teenage boy and the handsome drifter she travels with show her the different forms her life could take if she leaves her chosen life behind. The trials the group experiences force Skylar to weigh the different possibilities of what her future could look like. The story's unexpected ending speaks to the courage and power it takes to devote oneself to finding the truth.
