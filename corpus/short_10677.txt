A mosquito's view of the world up close. While buzzing about a fruit and vegetable stand a mosquito is smitten by a young woman. It follows her home only to discover she is about to entertain a young man. While she finishes dressing the mosquito takes on the suitor whose behavior chasing the insect looks ever so bizarre to his date. The insect may well succeed in driving away its rival but what will happen if it does get the woman alone? Can its love remain platonic or will it be thank you ma'am slam bam?
