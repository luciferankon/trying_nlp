A couple kisses passionately at a bus stop. They board the bus go to the back seat and continue kissing. She suggests a trip to Bariloche next week he proposes that they camp. She will want to shop for souvenirs; he pulls a small toy dog out of his pocket and gives it to her. She laughs he wants to know why and suddenly inexplicably the spell is broken. Silence and distance descend on the couple. Will they sort it out before the bus reaches her stop? Are there any more kisses in store for the two of them?
