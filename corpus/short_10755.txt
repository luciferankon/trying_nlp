Williams Harland is given camera time to talk about random thoughts and burp. He answers questions like the historical era in which he'd like to live and his favorite dirty word and he tells us the only other person he knows of with the name "Harland". He includes a few comments about his movie experiences but mostly he tosses out some attempts at warped humor.
