Wayne and Shuster in this series present some of their earlier work from the long-running Wayne & Shuster show such as the Bible Bowl Murder at the Stratford Festival Dorian Wayne The Wonderful World of... The World and their signature sketch "Frontier Psychiatrist". These are all color sketches but since they had been active since the '50s they later also presented a compilation of black & white material "Wayne and Shuster in Black and White" (1996).
