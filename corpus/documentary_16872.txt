Jeorge is a knife-sharpener. Despite being old and retired he still keeps on working. Even health is not on his side but this doesn't seem to stop him. He drives down the streets with his motorcycle loaded with the trade's tools day in and day out. Along the way he meets people he has known for years; he relives the past with them and looks concerned at the future which seems to want to erase them.
