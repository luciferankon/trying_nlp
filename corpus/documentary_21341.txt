The French painter Fabienne Verdier trained by traditional calligraphers in China and famous for her large abstract canvases leaves the safety of her studio and embarks on an exploratory adventure with musicians at the prestigious Juilliard School of Music in New York. The film follows her journey of liberation as she frees herself from the constraints of her training and rediscovers through improvised collaborations a world of emotion and creative energy.
