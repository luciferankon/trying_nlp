A couple hours after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941 Ichiro Kataoka was the first San Francisco Japanese prisoner taken by the FBI from his hotel in Japan Town. Through a series of unfortunate events Ichiro would eventually reunite with his family roughly three years later in Topaz Utah after President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 which forced all Japanese residing on the West Coast to relocate to desolate Internment Camps throughout the country. Their only crime was being of Japanese ancestry. Decades later through a collection of footage the Kataoka family legacy is being told through Ichiro's daughter great-grandson and relatives of what this family had endured. Although this was a dark time in America's history we find that love and happiness can blossom in the darkest of places.
