The title of the film recalls the well known story of the three blind men who try in vain to recognize and define by touch an unknown object - in this case an elephant. In a triptych of three different stories told by three inmates of a jail the story unfolds with sarcasm and irony regarding human actions. The heroes of the film try to tame human passions (erotically instinctive) - but alas they do not succeed. A situation comedy in which the nude appears in the plot where least expected.
