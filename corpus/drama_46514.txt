An arrogant and unorthodox teacher returns as principal to the idyllic high school from which he had earlier been fired to find it a den of drug abuse gang violence and urban despair. Eventually his successful but unorthodox methods lead to a clash with city officials that threatens to undo all his efforts. Based on a true story. When a school in Paterson New Jersey has less-than-average basic skills test scores it faces the possibility of being taken over by the state. So the mayor asks the school superintendent for help and he suggests that they appoint the controversial Joe Clark as the school principal. Clark begrudgingly agrees. And when he arrives he shakes things up by reassigning teachers and calling all of them incompetent. And it isn't long before a lot of people want him out but at the same time he gains the respect of some of the teachers and the students. An extraordinary situation calls for an extraordinary solution. At strife-torn Eastside High School in Paterson New Jersey that solution had a name: Principal "Crazy Joe" Clark. With a bullhorn in one hand and a baseball bat in the other he slammed the door on losers at Eastside. Brought in as a last resort to stop the state government from taking control of the school Clark chained the doors shut to keep troublemakers OUT and achievers IN. Parents fought him. Teachers resented him. Even his own boss doubted him. But lots of kids loved him. Clark turned Eastside around appearing on the cover of "Time Magazine" and becoming a national symbol of tough-love education. "If you don't succeed in life" Clark tells his students "don't blame your backgrounds. Don't blame the Establishment. Blame YOURSELVES." His message is simple: Don't lean on excuses drugs crime or anger. LEAN ON ME...and learn.
