The Paris based digital artists' community Pleix had made a fantastic comment on our obssesion with the perfection in the human body form. Astral Body Church project involves bodybuilders with the faces of old people who seem to be miming psuedo-religious imagery. The video piece had created for La Nuite Blanche 2007 event and projected on the Saint-Eustache church Paris. The sculptural performance created by the slow movement of the images makes the whole scene more dramatic while disturbing the viewer with its weirdness on the church and leaving us in contemplation of the perception of the body in modern society.
