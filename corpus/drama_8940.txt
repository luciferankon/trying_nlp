Paul was blinded in an accident when he was four. He has lived with his father Eric since the death of his mother. Eric persuades his now 23-year-old son to have an operation that will restore his sight of one eye. But a long and frustrating road lies ahead before he can learn to see again. A psychologist helps him to recognize colors and forms then objects and perspective by means of visual stimuli. Finally he is taught to recognize faces and individuals. Little by little the psychologist discovers that Paul continues to see images of his mother.
