All Humphrey the beaver wants to do is build his damn. However his efforts are ignored by the community of woodland creatures around him. Everything changes when a billboard from the city becomes lodged in his dam. The arrival of the object seems like divine intervention and makes Humphrey the new leader. However he uses his acquired status for increasingly selfish reasons putting the small community and eventually his own life at risk.
