It's a reality that gets tougher to handle every day: roads and development are hemming in our spectacular wildlands trapping our amazing wild animals in habitats too small and offering no way out. But - there is a way: over under and around it. TrekWest adventurer John Davis believes if we learn to work together now we can save what we love before it's too late. If we connect our best wild places we will give wildlife enough room to survive and do what comes naturally -- keeping our landscapes and communities healthy. It's about identifying problems and supporting their solutions. Taking the route of grizzlies wolves cougars and jaguars John experienced their greatest challenges in getting where they need to go. This alone however would accomplish little. He went the extra mile meeting conservation heroes and learning about amazing projects that are key to connecting western wild places. Follow John Davis as he treks 5000 miles in 8 months from Mexico to Canada to bring awareness to the importance of connected wildlife corridors along the spine of the continent.
