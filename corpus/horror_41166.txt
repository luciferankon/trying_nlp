Having been always molested by her step-father Samantha decided to move to a boarding house that is located in a very haunted area. Rumours had it that Kuntilanak (the she-demon) lived up in a hundreds of years old tree near the house. Her boyfriend Agung tried to warn her but she did not pay any attention. Soon people around her died one by one tragically. Even Agung then mysteriously disappeared.
