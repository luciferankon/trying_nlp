Philosophical insights routinely give way to moments of lush cinematic reverie in this breezy narrative shot in sun-dappled Florida. In the midst of watching a dog (Kaji the Dog) phoning a pretty girl (Dominique Joelle) and entertaining a neighbor (Robin Morrissey-Jones) eccentric twins Simon and Dave (writer-director Dave Andrae) become immersed in intriguing conversations while amusing themselves and to varying degrees those around them. Colorful and at times humorous The Plants Are Listening weaves together a unique array of artistic influences that's oddly harmonious. Features original music by New Zealand singer-songwriter Robert Scott (of The Bats and The Clean) Vicekopf (a.k.a. Gregory Whitehead) and People's Palms.
