This DVD consists of footage from an incredible Reggae festival held at the historical Empire Roller Skating Center in Brooklyn NY circa 1983. It includes sets from such legendary artists as Big Youth Leroy Sibbles Ken Boothe Delroy Wilson Tinga Stewart Roman Stewart The Blues Busters - Lloyd Campbell and Phillip James and Max Romeo. The 30000-square-foot venue a go-to spot for skate-world renegades in the early 70s was a de facto community center where teenagers came after school and families spent the weekend. It was the perfect place to host such a historically important music event such as this.
