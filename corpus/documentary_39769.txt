7 Brothers 7 Brothers born between 1929 and 1945 in MÃ¼lheim/Germany are led into a silent setting. No questions asked a vast conversation begins. Together they tell the story of their family from the mid thirties until now. Seven life-paths of a generation that has hardly been heard crossing each other and revealing a unique view of German family life during and after the war. A complex universe unfolds showing deep family relationships and brotherhood. The film offers the unusual experience of sharing the memories of seven brothers - and the more we listen the more we somehow become part of the narration. What the Hufschmidt family tells us is not only mirroring the most difficult period of German history but puts up an essential personal question: what is my family all about?
