Friends of Firefighters is a crucial support service for the FDNY. Born during the aftermath of 9/11 the organization has grown from helping 3 firehouses cope the devastation of the tragedy to being city wide and now in its thirteenth year has helped thousands of firefighters deal with the ongoing traumas and difficulties of their job. Show Love felt that we wanted to help share their story and encourage wider support. The film features both active and retired firefighters as well as actor Steve Buscemi who himself was a fireman and over the years has become an ardent supporter of both the FDNY and Friends of Firefighters. Many thanks to all those involved in the making of this film.
