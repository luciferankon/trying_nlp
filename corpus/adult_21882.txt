Six teen girls arrive at Camp Red Duck. They're there as their camp counselor Laurette reminds them "Because your parents were too lazy to take care of you this summer". Two Mary and Susan walk in and are never seen again. One Joan decides to make the best of the situation and begins working her way through the male staff beginning with the camp director Mr. Wasserman. The other three Wendy Lisa and Jennie are virgins but don't intend to remain so. The three make a bet. The first girl to lose her cherry will command the other two for a full day.
