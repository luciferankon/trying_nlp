Dead Leaf Echoes is the continuing improvised mumblecore webseries based around the lives of a group of friends entering their early 30s. Each 4 episode season will focus on a member of the group and has both professional and unprofessional actors mixing with each other. The first season follows Sophie trying to make a career of being an actress instead of a one shot wonder but not everyone is as enthusiastic or optimistic as her.
