Paradiso is my second feature film the first being 'Umformung-The Transformation'. This movie is part of my trilogy 'Search' series the third film is yet to be made. In Paradiso I was more of a Psychologist and less of a Director. It was exhilarating and at the same time terrifying to make Paradiso to delve deep into other human mind is no less adventurous then diving deep into the ocean. The untold diversions of the common man I tried to unfold in the movie. The movie is less of a Drama and more of a Narrative. Also the Protagonist has no name and no dialogue in the movie. I wanted everyone to identify himself and herself with the Protagonist. Paradiso is a movie that is at once comic and also intensely profound and tragic. Though set in 1960's in a city somewhere resembling Kolkata in India yet the story is relevant now all the more. In fact the theme of the movie is timeless. The loneliness of a man who mirrors the perception of his family because of his self imposed silence is at once hilarious as well dark. In a way it mirrors the emptiness of our soul. The man lives in the world one 'Real' one 'Imagined' till the point where both collide and become one. To see the movie is at once humbling and profound.
