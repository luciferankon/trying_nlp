While new houses had periodically been offered as grand prizes on previous game shows such as the original "Price is Right" never was there a show which offered a new home as the top prize...that is until "Dream House." In this game hosted by Mike Darrow two couples including a returning champion competed to win a brand new home worth $40000 or more. The game was a basic general knowledge quiz with several rounds played and multiple-choice and true-false questions asked. Cash amounts were awarded for correct answers depending on the round and other factors. The top scoring couple of the day was the champion and won a room of furniture valued at $3000 or more. If the couple won a certain number of shows (seven on the daytime series four on the prime-time version) the couple won their dream house. Before the show the couple chose what type of house they wanted to play for--it could be a house using contemporary ranch farmhouse and modern styling (worth $40000 or more); or they could opt for a far-less expensive alternative such as a vacation cottage modular home houseboat or motorhome (still worth at least $8500). The show would be revised in 1983 under the same name with Bob Eubanks as host.
