In this low budget independent 90 minute feature film (divided here on Youtube into two 45 minute parts) shot in New Jersey and New York there are strange things simmering under the calm facade of a typical suburban town. A drug dealer "The Man" who lives in a plant shaded house on Tree Stump Lane is doling out drugs to the local youth including a young man named Waldo McFadden. This is the starting point for a comedy of errors that ensues in this eerie twitching land of tortured souls each mired in their own mental machinations. Nobody gets what they want and not everyone survives to tell the tale.
