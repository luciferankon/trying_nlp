A gritty new docuseries from South Africa's wild frontier BUSH AIR follows CC Pocock as he toughens up American pilots with his extreme bush and mountain flying course moonlights as a pursuit pilot chasing real life car thieves and unwinds with cooking sessions and crash stories in his Bush Pilot's pub. In the sky his students (airline captains to celebrity pilots) will experience the flying scenarios that nearly took CC's life and now shape his unorthodox message and methods. On the ground they'll find themselves immersed in the life of a maverick with rules to bend bureaucrats to battle and the occasional spitting cobra to "shoo" from his hangar. For CC Pocock it's just another week in the bush. For his guests it's a 72 hour adventure that will transform them as pilots and people and could someday save their lives.
