On any given beautiful day at a Beverly Hills café patrons converge converse and chuckle over a beverage entrée and desert. At a casual glance they are just small moments in time over a bowl of tomato soup a slice of chocolate cake or a cup of red tea. But from the vantage point of one spoon there's a whole new insight on modern America. For the spoon its just another day: deceit disgrace death. Cole and Josh Summers' quirky and somber vision is brought to life by a seamlessly subtle ensemble and tantalizingly ambiguous screenplay by Cole Summers and Mike Cunio . After watching 'Spoonfed' you won't look at a spoon the same way.
