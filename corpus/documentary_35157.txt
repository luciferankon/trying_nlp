For the past 12 years journalist Paul Moreira has travelled extensively in Iraq. In this film he goes in search of the men he filmed back in 2003 at the very beginning of the American occupation. Through their stories and by tracing the roots of ISIS to the arrival of Abu Mousab Al-Zarqawi and America's handling of the resistance he tells the story of how Iraq became such a fractured nation.
