A gripping portrait of one Puerto Rican family living in NYC. Roberto 29 the eldest son gay and living in Greenwich Village. Marta the family matriarch living in Brooklyn and raising the grandchildren that have for the most part been abandonded by their parents. Danny 23 returning from Riker's Island after spending yet more time in jail. Beatriz vanishing periodically to indulg her crack cocain habit. Hip-Hop and Latin music serve as the sound track to this honest but often painful portrait of an American family.
