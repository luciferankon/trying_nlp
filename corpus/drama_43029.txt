This unique black and white film is a psychological drama about an Egyptian production designer named Maha. The film takes an unnerving turn when she finds herself transported into a completely different persona-a married housewife. This original piece remarkably captures the loneliness faced by some sufferers of mental illness as well as the challenges faced by their loved ones. Filmmaker Ahmad Abdalla (Rags and Tatters LFF 2013) fashions a beautiful tribute to the golden era of 1940s and 1950s Egyptian cinema. Abdalla shows plenty of aesthetic invention that has rightly seen him hailed as the leader of the critically acclaimed new independent Egyptian cinema.
