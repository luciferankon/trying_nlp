Mars is inhabited humans genetically modified to live in the Martian environment that was working fine. Recently though ordinary Humans (who call the modified humans "Martinis") start to aggressively Terra-forming Mars to their liking. The two cannot flourish in the same conditions and stealth wars break out between them. To the tall thin Martinies all non-modified humans are "FATmen" a reference to comparative appearance but also to the greedy appetites of Earth-borne immigrants. Tedesco his argumentative family in tow is one such immigrant family coming into Mars (on his used former space-brothel ship). Tedescoe is an ex-police-man now in search of a new kind of work a safe place for his family and a life free of politics. But soon his job providing security at a terra-forming station will cause him to take sides the consequences for his family and him will be life-changing.
