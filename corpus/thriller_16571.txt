Beautiful young actress/waitress Zoey is having a rough month...until the offer to temporarily live a posh existence comes her way via an influential young couple. A familiar scenario in all our lives...someone we trust to watch our pets while we're away. A mansion in the hills seems like the lap of luxury but as the neighborhood grows strange Zoey is on the edge. It seems like the dogs aren't the only thing being watched. What happens while we're gone is anybody's guess...but what we come home to...could be our worst nightmare.
