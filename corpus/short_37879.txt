RABL (1985) combines film 3D human movement computer animation (pre-motion capture technology) and dance performance. RABL is an early cinematic statement about humanizing the machine versus mechanizing the people. Conceived and choreographed by Patrice M Regnier RABL explores human bodies interacting with technology the real and the simulated. What starts as a normal scene people interacting with computers in a laboratory morphs into an abstraction where this relationship is explored. With the support of the Computer Graphics Laboratory at the New York Institute of Technology Regnier collaborated with film composer Carter Burwell animation designer Rebecca Allen and cinematographer Ed Lachman to make this experimental piece. The film was shown throughout the world as well as a live performance called RAB that combined and examined these same subjects.
