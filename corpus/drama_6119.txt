Three old college mates from Tijuana meet every year to chat about life and catch up. They opposite poles one being a rocker philosopher and the other a conservative and godly person. Their respect for each other and mutual appreciation make this old friendship possible. One of them goes through a sudden crisis that that will send them on a physical road trip as well as one through memory lane. Even though these are friends from very diverse backgrounds and ideologies that normally renege their lot in life for not having access to the American dream since they are so close in Tijuana just a stone throw away this new situation helps them reflect and be appreciative of the things they do have.
