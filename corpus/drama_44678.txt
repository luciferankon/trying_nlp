The story of the birth of Jesus updated to that of a farm girl in the Karoo who gets pregnant and maintains that she is still a virgin. Even though miraculous events accompany the birth of her child people refuse to believe that she was impregnated by the Holy Spirit and she seeks a new life among people who are more believing. In Afrikaans language with English subtitles.
