The sign on the door reads Sexual Therapist - Director of Family Relations. What the unsuspecting patients don't realize is that when they enter and sign in they are in for some unusual sexual healing. An exotic African plant which sits innocently in the reception area emits a powerful aphrodisiac and when humans smell the attractive bud libidos run rampant. This unusual plant therapy catches on with all his patients in a mass orgy of sexual energy all his patients are cured. All well and good but the doctor loses his whole practice in one day.
