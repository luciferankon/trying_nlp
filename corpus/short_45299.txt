In 1946 film critic Nino Frank first applied the term "film noir" to some of the films Hollywood was producing during the period. Discussions of noir often center on visual and specifically cinematic elements such as chiaroscuro extreme camera angles and expressionist distortion. Both literary and cinematic noir are defined by the shifting roles of the protagonist the ill-fated relationship between the protagonist and society generating the themes of alienation and entrapment. In Adamo Macri's video piece "SLIDE" he attributes the idea of noir as a filmic mise en scƒçne approach to portraiture.
