In this social experiment four mentors - all accomplished and compassionate individuals - are challenged to help realize the hopes and dreams of four homeless individuals. The process is not without its pitfalls however as the mentors learn that people who live on the streets end up there for a complex variety of reasons and that being homeless means more than just not having a place to live.
