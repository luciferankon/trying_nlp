Cesano is a small town in the Roman countryside with an abnormally high incidence of leukaemia and other diseases especially among children. It is also home to the Vatican Radio's global transmitter site. Links between the two have lead residents of Cesano to form a committee and engage in a long legal battle against Vatican Radio which has led up to an investigation for manslaughter.
