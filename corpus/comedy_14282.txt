Kevin Trudeau is a genius. But is he an evil genius or a terribly misunderstood do-gooder? In 2009 after rising to become the world's preeminent television infomercial pitchman Kevin embarked on his most audacious venture yet a secret society that would open the doors to multi-million dollar incomes and opulent lifestyles to the average Joe -- all for a menu of steep fees most of which go straight into Kevin's bank account. This is the Kevin Trudeau...that Kevin Trudeau doesn't want you to know about who is about to see his undoing propelled by a young Sonic Drive-In restaurant manager with his own dreams dashed after losing $30000 to Kevin's scheme.
