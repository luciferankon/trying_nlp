The office of our host now has a telephone installed but he soon regrets its presence when Heckle and Jeckle Dinky Duck and Gandy Goose make prank phone calls to him. Meanwhile he offers the children in the audience a safety tip regarding where it is safe to ride a bicycle fast and where it isn't. And he introduces four Terrytoons cartoons: _Dancing Shoes (1949)_ (qv) and _The Fox Hunt (1950)_ (qv) with Heckle and Jeckle; _Hook Line and Sinker (1939)_ with Gandy Goose; and _The Timid Scarecrow (1953)_ (qv) with Dinky Duck.
