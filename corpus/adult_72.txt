No it's the "basis" of this movie but you won't take that seriously even if you don't fall of the bed laughing because of the cute picture of the "professor" on the floor using a toy Roulette wheel and klicking the keys of an Atari ST computer (probably the same the all-electronic MIDI-music soundtrack was produced on? back in '89 STs were superior to PCs!).
