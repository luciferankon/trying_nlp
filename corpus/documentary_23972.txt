An examination of Cuba's "moral purges" that began in 1964 with UMAP camps for those suspected of or found guilty of "improper conduct." Key moments brought outside attention to these policies: the defection of ballet dancers in Paris in 1966 a 48-hour period in 1980 when more than 11000 Cubans sought asylum in Havana's Peruvian embassy and the brief detention of writer Virgilio Pi≈Ñera. Interviews with exiles take up most of the film as they tell their stories and ponder the Castro government's arrest and detention of persons with effeminate mannerisms: what the state calls "extravagant behavior." In essence the film exposes the Cuban state's homophobic petit bourgeois nature.
