To his many admirers Ronald Reagan was often known as "The Gipper;" the optimistic patriot and gifted politician. His detractors called him "The Teflon President" because no criticism ever seemed to stick. But just about everybody agreed that Ronald Reagan was a great communicator -- a skilled public speaker who used confidence style and wit to make his case and send a message. As a radio announcer actor corporate spokesman governor and finally as president Reagan honed that message and built a following. His skill at communicating -- the ability to connect with people and persuade them -- is among the things he is best remembered for today. Hosted by Brian Williams.
