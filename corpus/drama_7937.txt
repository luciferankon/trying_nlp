Made during Bergman's tax-related exile in Germany the film continues the story of Katarina and Peter EGermann the feuding childless professional couple who appear in one episode of "Scenes From A Marriage." After Peter perpetrates a horrendous crime in its first scene the rest of the film consists of a non-linear examination of his motivations incorporating a police psychological investigation scenes from the EGermanns' married life and dream sequences. Peter Egermann from a privileged background has just killed prostitute Katarina Krafft - Ka to most who know her - a fact that he has informed his longtime friend and therapist Mogens Jensen a professor of psychiatry to help him deal with and understand it. Two weeks earlier Peter had mentioned to Mogens that he was having homicidal thoughts of killing his own wife Katarina Egermann despite the two loving each other in their own way including having a symbiotic sex life. Mogens' initial thoughts are that Ka was either meant to be a prelude to killing Katarina or surrogate instead of Katarina. Several episodes in Peter and Katarina's joint and individual lives leading up to the murder are presented which may provide some insight into Peter's homicidal mindset. Several post-murder episodes related to the event are also presented most of them interviews by the Inspector leading the investigation including one with Peter's self-absorbed and overbearing actress mother Cordelia Egermann and another with Katarina's homosexual business partner "Tim". All these episodes lead to Mogens providing his own professional assessment of Peter and the murder.
