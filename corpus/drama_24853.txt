An erotic thriller from the director of Psychopathia Sexualis THE LITTLE DEATH offers a peek into the seedy boudoirs of a Victorian-era brothel where a strong-willed reformer (Courtney Patterson) and a corrupter of innocence battle over the fate of a young woman (Christie Vozniak) who seems to be held there in sexual captivity. While the owner attempts to mesmerize and seduce the would-be rescuer a meek student (Clifton Guterman) wanders into the house and becomes a tragic pawn in the psychological game of cat-and-mouse that is rapidly unfolding. Based on the play Death and Devil by Frank Wedekind (Spring Awakening) integrated with Anton Chekhov's short story "A Nervous Breakdown" THE LITTLE DEATH provides a thoughtful examination of the immorality of prostitution - but then savagely dashes all preconceived notions of "good vs. evil" in a climax that is as violent as it is unexpected.
