The Berlin based music documentary filmmaker couple Dietmar Post & Lucia Palacios are the equivalent to the American music film icons D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus. With their award-winning film "Monks: The Transatlantic Feedback" they were responsible for the rediscovery of the 60s cult band "monks". Also with their new film project they are devoted intensively to an event that could be considered outside the big music business. This time the filmmakers portrait in the style of Direct Cinema the open air "Klangbad Music Festival" which has been taking place since 2004. The "Klangbad Festival" is curated by Hans Joachim Irmler who was one of the founding members of the legendary Krautrock band Faust. The film demonstrates how the festival attempts to go back to the original idea of music festivals experimentation and improvisation a clear rejection of commercialization and a commitment towards the interaction between musicians and audience. With these objectives the festival has turned into a reservoir for the German and international avant-garde a meeting point for both the veterans of the movement and the newcomers. As a second film we see a complete Faust live show from 2005.
