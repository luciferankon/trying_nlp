Hiring "the best and the brightest" in the business he - along with his personal assistant - are holding an energy party to brainstorm ideas for the club when an obscure gypsy curse is accidentally invoked summoning the evil elemental force of 'Thed Ude' to wreak havoc on the revelers. In the end only the unsuspecting Pizza Man can save the day but only if he can overcome the worst day ever in the life of an over-weight balding lonely pizza delivery man.
