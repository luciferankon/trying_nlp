Eric Hayes is a stringer. One notch below the lowest rung of the journalistic ladder. A video vulture preying on police chases ambulance runs and random street violence selling his footage to the highest bidder and living on a steady diet of cigarettes and bloodlust. For years Eric has lived off of other people's pain and misery. But he's about to discover something beneath the streets of Los Angeles even hungrier for blood than he is. He's about to discover THE GHOULS.
