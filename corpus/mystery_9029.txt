But how can Anna Lilah and Holly enjoy themselves when their father is locked up for a crime he didn't commit? Of this they are certain. Their father is innocent. But how can they show that to everyone else? The case is closed. The police have their perpetrator. It's up to the sisters to find evidence to prove their father's innocence. They decide to run away from the foster home and face the wild in order to find the real kidnapper. But sometimes what you hope for most won't always be the truth...
