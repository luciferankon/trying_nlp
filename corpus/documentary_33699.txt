Kon-Tiki was the name of a wooden raft used by six Scandinavian scientists led by Thor Heyerdahl to make a 101-day journey from South America to the Polynesian Islands. The purpose of the expedition was to prove Heyerdal's theory that the Polynesian Islands were populated from the east---specifically Peru---rather than from the west (Asia)as had been the theory for hundreds of years. Heyerdahl made a study of the winds and tides in the Pacific and by simulating conditions as closely as possible to those he theorized the Peruvians encountered set out on the voyage.
