On a Friday night after a long week at work Calvin Davis joined his family in Southwest Washington DC for an informal gathering. Still wearing scrubs from his job at Children's National Medical Center Calvin caught up with an old friend while his two boys rode bikes around the block. When police followed his fifteen year-old home pulling on gloves as they approached the teenager Calvin intervened to ask "Why? What did he do?" How these questions escalated into a night in jail for a father with no prior record will make you "Think of Calvin" next time you question racial profiling or how America has become the world's most prolific jailer.
