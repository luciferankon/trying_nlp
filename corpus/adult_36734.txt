This is one of the "One Day Wonders" made for $5000. for the Gambinos. At this point they were into teenage titles so I came up with Sweet Sixteen. The problem was the available cast wasn't young enough to remotely resemble the title. When my partner and I screened this picture for Sid Levine the Gambinos front man he just shook his head and said "Sweet Sixteen?.... You guys should have called this 'Life Begins At Forty'". Oh well...
