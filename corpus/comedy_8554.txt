A middle-aged Hong Kong man is married to two domineering and stubborn women but nonetheless treats them as his queens. When he was told that he cannot immigrate to the United States with two wives he seeks the help of his U.S. Citizen doctor friend by asking him to marry one of his wives and divorce her later when they all reach the states. Meanwhile the doctor is trying to court his much-younger girlfriend and does not realize that the nurse at his clinic has a crush on him.
