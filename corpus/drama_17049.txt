Examining magistrate Kilián ('Otomar Korbelár' (qv)) is suspended because he allegedly enabled his friend Rynes ('Miroslav Homola' (qv)) to commit suicide in prison. The unfortunate Kilián under the name Kypr finds a position for himself as a copy clerk in a legal office. He cares for Rynes's daughter Anna Marie ('Lenka Podhájská' (qv)) in exemplary fashion and soon gains the favour of the indigent to whom he provides legal advice in the beerhall The Lout.
