A short film about self-censorship imposed behavioral norms opinions and attitudes which ultimately lead to the crucifixion of one's personality. The film begins with the retrospective memory of the earliest days of author's childhood and continues toward the present day showing the process of changing and forging one's personality. The process includes the influence of the parents and surrounding as well as the mass-media. Through a series of short flash-backs the author reflects upon socially-imposed restrictions and rules she encounters in her everyday life. In the end one question stays opened- is anyone strong enough to endure the weight of chains?
