An interstellar space Archaeologist Explorer determined to find the truth about his father's disappearance some 30 years prior who was searching for an ancient artifact that possesses unbelievable power. He begins a journey that takes him to a ruthless band of female mercenaries led by a Han Solo-type intent on gaining profit and wealth to locate this "artifact" his father deemed: "Project Abaddon." The location of this "artifact" is where his father was supposedly lost along with his colleague Dr. Carlton Dashira obsessed with finding this ancient artifact. Now they must learn who's side they're on work to defend everyone from themselves and find a way to unite and protect billions against an alien force that's coming to destroy everything for one thing: that very artifact. The adventure begins on a star ship with a mercenary crew. When you meet them they will either love you or drop you where you stand without a blink of an eye. It's a journey not a destination that takes our diverse crew of misfits that feels like the Magnificent 7 meets Battlestar Galactica meets Indiana Jones with the drama of "24" thrown in for good measure. This is NOT *Star Trek(TM)ŽŠ but a BRAND NEW story set 600 years in our future and starts in the 4th Century Song Dynasty China. *The term STAR TREK belongs to PARAMOUNT STUDIOS/CBS TELEVISION and is in NO WAY a part of Project Abaddon. Star Trek is only used here as a REFERENCE.
