Odette Springer is working in the B movie industry as a singer/composer hating it but needing the work. She begins making this documentary about the low budget sex and slasher flicks and the people who work on them. Along the way she meets unrepentantly boorish producers directors arguing the legitimacy of what they're doing and numerous actresses who feel trapped with no other way to succeed in Hollywood. The project is eye-opening to the viewer...and to Odette herself.
