Very different in format from the 1945-1957 version hosted by Bert Parks this show was primarily based on luck and nerves with the ability to separate truth from bluff helping out. Two contestants (One's a Returning Champion) were presented with a 4x5=20 grid with 9 celebrity guests seated along the top and side. Behind each square in the grid was either a set amount of money ($100 both abc & syndicated $200 on abc $300 both abc & syndicated & $500 on syndicated) a money bag a wild account or a blank. If a contestant chose a blank his or her turn was over and control was passed to his or her opponent. If he or she drew a dollar amount a question would be asked of the celebrities to the top and side of the square with one answering truthfully (True) and the other giving a fake answer (False). If the contestant picked the correct answer he or she was allowed to continue. If the contestant picked the wrong answer he or she was unable to continue and gets the account to him or her. If the player chose a money bag however he or she was given the choice of refusing the money bag and continuing to choose squares or keeping the bag but giving up control to his or her opponent. The game ended when one contestant had claimed three of the same denomination squares {ergo: $300-$100x3 $600-$200x3 $900-$300x3 & $1500-$500x3}. If the contestant was able to control 3 money bag squares he or she would be given to win the special "Break the Bank" Bankroll for collecting 3 cash bags with a dollar sign($) on it that in which started at $5000 and grew larger with each day for 5-Day Week {$500 added early and $250 added late in the run} until it was won. The Bonus Round called "Raise Up The Stakes for $2500" The Champion will able to raise $1000 in order to win $2500 cash prize by having one has a cash amount ($100 to $500) and one has "BUST!" The Champion pick 1 Star has a cash amount or "BUST!" When it's a cash amount he or she will be awarded or When it's a "BUST" he or she lose all the account that collected so far. After that The Champion will face a new challenger.
