Tracey Berkowitz 15 a self-described normal girl loses her 9-year old brother Sonny. In flashbacks and fragments we meet her overbearing parents and the sweet clueless Sonny. We watch Tracey navigate high school friendless picked on and teased. She develops a thing for Billy Zero a new student imagining he's her boyfriend. We see the day she loses Sonny and we watch her try to find him. In bits and pieces we see what leads up to her riding in the back of a city bus wrapped in a shower curtain. Coming of age or just surviving?
