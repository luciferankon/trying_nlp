How different was the World War II military experience with that of personnel today? How similar? Given the changing technological and geopolitical landscape how has the 'soldier's life' transformed over the last 6 decades? Are motivations the same even though conditions and combatants are dramatically different? How do wide-eyed enthusiastic young men and women with small-town roots assimilate with those from uniquely different backgrounds and cultures. Do these encounters shade their civilian years...permanently? On May 28th and 29th of 2010 (to coincide with the Chagrin Falls Blossom Festival and Memorial Day ceremonies) we collected stories from those who were there and from the loved ones of those who served with pride. From Iwo Jima to Iraq...we heard emotional raw often surprising and always captivating tales of service...some stories shared for the very first time. One Mission is a snapshot of those who keep us free; important viewing for anyone who wants a better understanding of these men and women who serve our country and walk among us. They are our neighbors our teachers our firemen...our friends.
