A group of ranchers led by Colonel Arnold and Ward Gordon are drilling an oil well but getting fierce opposition from an unknown gang of outlaws. Eastern promoter J.B."Dude" Dawson is behind the gang as he is out to prevent the co-op members from striking oil before their lease expires so he can secure the property for his company. When Ward with the help of Arnold and his daughter Sally arranges for a new driller to be brought in the replacement man is killed and one of Dawson's men takes his place.
