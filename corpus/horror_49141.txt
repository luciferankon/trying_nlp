Pure evil exists. It lives in Hanoi in a small house that has been partly converted into an operating-theatre-cum-torture-chamber. Here patients are cut up into bite-size pieces and posthumously raped by a cannibalistic doctor and his taciturn sidekick. His fat son now also addicted to the taste of human flesh befriends the children of a prostitute who fell victim to the deadly doctor. This amoral violence is inevitably passed on to the next generation. A cycle of cruelty is set in motion.
