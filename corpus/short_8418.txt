Milton Bradley's game "Perfection" is "a race against time" where players must match shapes to a board in 60 seconds. The game mirrors an Asian American woman's struggle to achieve success and gain her parent's approval. Taught the game as an infant she races into her teens winning competitions and getting straight A's only left to wonder whether or not her parents will love her even if she fails. Ultimately she must decide to end the game.
