Shih Hsin-chiao (Ling Yun) is a journalist who trained under mentor Lu Tao-jan (Chin Han). Lu's daughter Chih-pai (Tien Niu) is infatuated with the good-looking and intelligent Shih but Shih sees her only as a child. When he returns from a long stay abroad he finds that things have changed. Chih-pai is now an attractive young woman in a relationship with rich boy (Wang Yu). A miscarriage and Lu's death throw Shih and Chih-pai back together again.
