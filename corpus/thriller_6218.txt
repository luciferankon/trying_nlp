Victor Sandeman is a senior partner with Brunel Global Securities. He is experiencing major financial problems ones that can be solved if the planned $100 million merger of the company takes place. However the company's owner Raymond Brunel is against the merger. Thinking that he can overpower the ineffective David Brunel Raymond's grandson and the company's heir apparent Victor murders the elderly Raymond (trying to make it look like a death by natural causes) so that he can go ahead with the planned merger. The one glitch in the murder is a possible witness Christine Sternwald. A paralegal and aspiring lawyer Christine is just putting her life back together following a sexual assault three years earlier. When Victor and Christine meet shortly after the murder in a fender bender with Victor driving the deceased Raymond's car Victor is forced to identify himself to her as Raymond Brunel. Because of this chance meeting and the possibility that she did see the murder take place Victor decides he has to get rid of Christine. Although Christine did not directly witness the murder her being in the wrong place at the wrong time places her and those close to her especially her roommate Maggie Wexler and her fianc√© Jeff Monroe in danger without her or their knowledge.
