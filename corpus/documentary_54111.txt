This documentary is created and directed by Dr. Thomas Keith where he analyzes how modern media influences sexism among males. He divides the documentary into four primary sections each one articulating the steps that media indirectly uses to contribute to male sexism. Ultimately media pressures young males into a rigid belief system where only a select few hold power and privilege and the rest are belittled and ostracized. Dr. Keith urges the audience to be more aware of how sexist views are portrayed in our society and that we should strive to discourage them.
