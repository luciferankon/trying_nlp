Afghanistan 2009. A Rifle section is halfway through their six-month tour of duty in Helmand Province. Sixteen men from their Battalion have already been killed. Forty-seven others have been wounded and flown back home. The last three months have been tough and it shows. Their kit is in a bad way. They are in a bad way. Young men with tans scruffy beards peeling noses and lips burnt raw by the Afghan sun. Despite the hardships they are enjoying their time out here learning how to fight the Taliban. The lads are on their way to becoming the best soldiers in the Army. Last Night Another Soldier... is the story of four of the young men in this Rifle section partly told from the point of view of eighteen-year-old squaddie David 'Briggsy' Briggs.
