Each episode focuses on several predator animals in a single environment such as the African plains or under the ocean. Boone Smith is the foxy host who narrates with enthusiasm the facts behind the vivid photography of each species taking down its natural prey. Easy to watch with fabulous HD photography and suitable for children--assuming they're old enough to know that things die.
