Cooper figured they had to be sunken ships including Cristopher Columbus' lost fleet and that these photos would become a map to discovering the lost treasure that now sat on the sea bed. Although Cooper passed away he left his long kept secret and treasure map to a close friend. The series follows the group of treasure hunters as they dive on sites photographed by Cooper 50 years ago from space in the hope of unearthing the sea's secrets
