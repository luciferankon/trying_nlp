A short film on the yearning to break free from the constraints that holds one back to no longer be locked away behind a closed door sealed inside a prison made by oneself. It takes much courage and much determination to take the brave step outside but in doing so you are no longer imprisoned behind four walls you are truly free in the vast world beyond where the sky is the limit
