Newlywed lawyers Clark and Madison Stevens make one more vow on their wedding night - to never have kids. Ever! Never say "ever"... Encouraged by their boss' guarantee to move up the ladder at their firm they accept an strange offer to test a new "product" for one of the firm's biggest clients; Robotech. Excitement turns to dismay and panic when they discover that the product is a seven-year old human like robot boy named "Bobby 7." To make matters worse the "test drive" must begin immediately just as they're about to leave for their sun soaked swimming in the Pacific long planned Hawaiian Honeymoon! From special instructions that Bobby isn't waterproof - so much for 'swimming in the Pacific" not to mention pools or even taking a shower - to bad people from a rival company out to steal Bobby's unique technological secrets Clark and Madison have to fight to keep their "son" safe and along the way learn what it truly means to be a parent; the joys the fear but most importantly the love a child brings.
