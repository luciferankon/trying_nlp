First in the education system then the legal system and finally through pharmaceuticals do we find out the extent of the government secretly working alongside Satan himself to destroy the population and ultimately release hell on earth. Only 2 detectives can put an end to it as they follow and chase Satan throughout the country but only to find out what they could never expect an adversary that never dies. 3 stories all different lives same results for them all as this fake drug conspiracy movie is FINALLY complete after 3 attempts. Fake weed fake cocaine and fake LSD are all being created by the government to destroy the population. Things get wilder as you learn that the devil himself has his hands in it as well while destroying people and businesses from inside out while 2 detectives are on the chase...only after death or worse will you get your answers.
