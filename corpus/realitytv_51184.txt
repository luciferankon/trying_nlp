Twelve modern kids are taken and put in a house where they live like they're in the 1970s. They can't use anything that didn't exist in the 70s including cellphones and iPods! They even have to use phrases from the 70s such as "groovy" and "foxy." If they bring up anything modern they can be brought to the elimination round. The winner will receive some huge prizes when they get back to living in 2005. Do these foxy kids have what it takes to live a groovy 70s life?
