Ann Wharton a rambunctious young student at the prestigious Bredwell Academy is in trouble after a spoonful of cereal she flung at a classmate hits Mrs. Bredwell in the face. As she is being reprimanded in Mrs. Bredwell's office a misunderstanding results in a member of the football team arriving at the office with Ann's clothes--she had left them behind when she changed into a football uniform so she could play football with the team--and Mrs. Bredwell writes to Ann's father notifying him that Ann is being expelled. She intercepts the letter but her troubles are far from over.
