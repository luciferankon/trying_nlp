Screamplay follows aspiring screenwriter Frank Stein whose B-movie horror scripts have not impressed the fat-cat studio exec at Moonster Pictures. To scramble up some extra cash Frank and his girlfriend Shelly Mary (who is both cooler and smarter) head to the Stein Manor. There they are greeted by Igorré the beautiful and vaguely foreign caretaker who shows Frank his father's secret laboratory and inventions- including a story machine. When Frank places one of his screenplays in the machine it malfunctions and creates a MONSTER. With the screenplay itself now transformed into a wide-eyed sharp-toothed creature with a thirst for blood Frank Shelly and Igorré must find a way to stop THE SCREAMPLAY.
