Omen has been redefining the boundaries of graffiti with his singular style of painting both on and off the streets. Using spray cans as his primary medium he has been leading the aerosol movement towards a truce with the established art world. No other medium has met with such resistance in its quest to be accepted as a valid form of expression. The majority of the art world's curators and collectors continue to view graffiti as a form of vandalism and "lower art". This is where Omen wants to set things straight.
