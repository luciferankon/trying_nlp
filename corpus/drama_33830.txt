Katharina (Simone Thomalla) and her 17-year-old son Sebastian (Lucas Reiber) are a well-established team. She brought him from the cleaning woman to an executive housekeeper of a luxury hotel in Leipzig. And the gifted young knight Sebastian (Lucas Reiber) is already considered a coming football star. But his dream to become a soccer pro seems to have burst from one moment to the next; a terrible car accident tied him to the wheelchair for an indefinite time. His loving mother is also shocked and from now on she is doing everything she can to get any medical advice so that he can have every little chance of healing.
