Pope Francis is shaking up the Catholic Church and putting the Vatican back on the world stage. The Argentine-born pontiff's stances on issues like the LGBT community women and the environment are changing the public perception of the Church. Some see him as a Marxist pope someone who has defiantly aligned himself with the poor. Others view him as a rock star pontiff who defies norms and appeals to a new generation of Catholics. But just how deep is he transforming the Church? Are his gestures more symbolic than real? As Pope Francis embarks on a visit to the United States we look at his rise to the papacy in Fusion's documentary Saint or Sinner: Pope Francis.
