A youngster in Lapland relates how his people herd reindeer and how important they are to their survival. The tribe follows the animals and when the animals find food the tribe builds shelters against the weather. When a reindeer is slaughtered for food nothing is wasted. A tribal wedding is also shown. When spring arrives the herd heads for the mountains and though an avalanche en rote destroys much of the herd they continue on. Other animals are seen in their natural habitat was well as the birth of baby deer. Roundup time for the deer arrives and they are put into a corral counted and branded on the ear. When summer ends the reindeer start the trek back. The tribal children are placed in a boarding school for the winter in town.
