My Change Adds Up dictates the daily changes that have occurred since the Recession. Even through the loss of jobs homes and a fallen economy it may not always seem clear but change is still coming.

Through change adding up as coins it illustrates the patience hope and struggle it takes to move towards progress in our communities as well as our country.
