Every show Mike Colameco gives viewers access to some of the best kitchens in the world and talks to real chefs in real restaurants cooking real recipes. It's an insider's guide and behind the scenes look from a chef's perspective on how these restaurants are putting together their dishes. Along the way we'll meet the owners chef's and their crews; we will hear their stories and eat some amazing food. Each show has a theme it might be an ingredient a neighborhood or a cuisine. And at the end of the show we will go back to Mike's kitchen and he'll teach you how to make a dish inspired by the restaurants we visited.
