A fashion designer returns to Denmark with his American wife Ursula. She is leery of the excesses of female nudity and the relaxed moral standards of the country. A visit to a psychiatrist reveals feelings of latent lesbianism but the doctor is not sure and recommends she be hospitalized. She befriends a recovering drug addict before he breaks into the medicine cabinet and kills himself with a drug overdose. She flees the facility into the willing arms of a beautiful fashion model resulting in an erotic tryst between the two women. Ursula later is forced to watch heterosexual pornography in an attempt to change her lesbian leanings.
