An old man has two problems. The first is to convince his prospective son-in-law to make a home for himself as soon as possible and remove the bride-to-be from his house lest he banned from the old man's home. The second is the preservation of his savings which he keeps as cash in the lining of his coat instead of in a bank. One day a thief [Akbar Abdi] comes into their apartment complex to take advantage of the old man's lack of awareness to give the slip to agents who are pursuing him. The thief grabs the coat and flees. From then on the old man the son-in-law the girl the agents and the thief are all trying to get their hands on this valuable coat.
