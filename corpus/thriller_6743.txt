Peter Sommer is the candidate of his party for the chancellor position. And with two more weeks to go until the elections the demographs tell that there is nothing to stop him from winning. But on the way home from one of the election events his car breaks down. Men with covered faces kidnap Sommer in the presence of his staff including his wife and daughter. They want ten million Deutschmarks. The first handing over by the party leader and friend Moll fails. The rest of the story is divided into three parts: Sommer's his wife's and Moll's view. Gathering information about and recalling the past all develop different theories about what really is planned.
