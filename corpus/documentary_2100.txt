The indigenous SÃ¡para and Kichwa nations of the Ecuadorian Amazon are fighting for their lives. Their campaign against oil drilling on their land is their last chance to save the pristine forest that they have called home for centuries. Their entire culture is being eroded by its inherent conflict with Western values. Filmmakers Joe Tucker and Adam Punzano embedded with the tribes and what emerges is a unique insight into the way that indigenous people live and see the world and a warning of what the world stands to lose if their rights and beliefs are not respected.
