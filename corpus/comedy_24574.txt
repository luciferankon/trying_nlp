In a small Swiss girls' boarding school which is also attended by 6 blond free-spirited Swedish girls Greta Inga Kerstin Lil Astrid and Selma Miss Klein leads a strict regiment. Neither she nor the gymnastics instructor Martin can stop the girls' pranks. The six leave nothing to do to wrap the men around their fingers. They also drive their favorite pranks with every man in the vicinity of many kilometers as far as they can make their excursions with their red bicycles.
