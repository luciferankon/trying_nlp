Bogard Missouri represents a fast-disappearing part of America's history. Thought to be named after an early resident Bogard became a railroad town in the mid-1800's when it was settled by the Scotch Irish and English and then a farming community which it remains to this day. Like hundreds of small towns and villages across America Main Street has given way to the mall in the next big town over. But the people of Bogard descendants of pioneers off-beat and independent still continue to thrive despite the upheavals of modern life.
