Randy California was still a teenager when after three months of playing nightly in New York with Jimi Hendrix he returned home to rejoin his musician friends in California. From the very first album Spirit which was released in 1968 Randy proved to be a songwriter and performer of immense talent. Spirit's performances became legendary infused with their unique blend of rock jazz and blues influences.
