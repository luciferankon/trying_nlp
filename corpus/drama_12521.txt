Like "Flashdance" DANCER steals your heart with the inspirational story of what it takes for a talented but unknown young teen to make it in the competitive world of professional dancers in New York. Although self-taught Tresa Roberts is a gifted athlete and phenomenal dancer with sights on a professional career. Despite her grit and streak of independence Tresa's aspirations clash with her single mother's protective instincts in a town where moving on and becoming somebody is just a dream waiting to be quashed by reality. Then Tresa's friend uploads videos of her dance routines to YouTube generating responses from millions of viewers including Pia a famous choreographer with an international touring dance company. Pia changes everything when she offers Tresa a scholarship to a prestigious dance academy in New York to compete with the best of the best in a one-time showcase event to determine who gets invited to join her company. Not only does being a great dancer not mean she's welcome Tresa soon discovers she is a threat personally and professionally to Amanda the accepted prima dancer at the Academy and established favorite to win the showcase. Arrogant and conniving Amanda and daughter of the Academy's president of the Board of Directors begins to see Tresa not only surpassing her as the odds-on choice to win but catching the eye of her boyfriend and pairs partner heartthrob and number one male dancer Nicholas. Tresa struggles to overcome these odds only to have tragedy strike. Once the internal politics at the academy raises its ugly head Tresa is left with nothing but a plane ticket home. Her only hope is to set aside her single-minded personal ambition and find the compassion in her heart to reach out to someone whose loss is far greater.
