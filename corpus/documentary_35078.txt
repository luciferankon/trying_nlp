Paris-Brest-Paris is the oldest cycling event still in existence. First staged in 1891 (12 years before the first Tour de France) it is held every 4 years and open to amateur cyclists from around the world. Incorporating interviews with Simon Doughty (sports psychologist & cycling coach author of 'The Long-Distance Cyclist') and Pierre Theobald (president of Audax Club Parisien) this film documents the 2003 Paris-Brest-Paris. It follows several UK cyclists through their often cold and lonely qualification rides to Paris in the summer sun - and the warm Gallic welcome extended to over 4000 entrants from 24 countries. Original music by Doug Briggs plus tracks from Canadian band 'Barachois' and Breton band 'Skolvan' combine to capture the unique flavour of Paris-Brest - the Holy Grail of long-distance cycling.
