The Whistler village comes to life during the festive season with a white blanket of snow and twinkling lights covering the trees and buildings. Winter vignettes of all three artists enjoying the wonderland that surrounds them. Jessie Farrell takes a picturesque horse drawn sleigh ride around the lake. Aaron Pritchett and his son Jordan Pritchett take an exhilarating ride on the Whistler peak to peak gondola spanning the distance between Whistler and Blackcomb Mountain. And George Canyon rides the slops enjoying every moment in this holiday season. Then the three artists join together for an intimate gathering around the winter fireplace. An unforgettable indoor live studio Christmas concert performed by George Canyon Aaron Pritchett and Jessie Farrell brings holiday cheer to the audience and smiles to all the children's faces. The show is always intimate. Always engaging and is always a celebration of the season friendship and music.
