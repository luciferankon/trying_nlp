Martin Carpenter is a stranger with a past full of pain and a future full of death. During a cold winter day in the poster civil war wilderness after a deadly encounter with two red neck cannibals and three jealous prostitutes he stumbles upon a US Marshal and four deadly prisoners. The Marshall is dying and deputizes Martin with the task of delivering the criminals to Fort Wilson. As they journey across the harsh western wasteland they will encounter a smooth talking Mexican bounty hunter the recently escaped leader of the gang who is on his way to rescue them and a psychopathic nun named Bloody Mary. A tribute to the classic American westerns of the 50s and the Spaghetti Westerns of 60s and 70s.
