In 2013 Taiwan's Golden Horse Film Festival celebrated its 50th anniversary. The ministry of Culture commissioned acclaimed Taiwanese documentary director Yang Li-chou to make a film about the history of Golden Horse Chinese-language cinema's oldest film awards. What is unique about the result is that it's not an ode to celebrities but about the role cinema plays in ordinary people's lives. It's a love letter to cinema filmmakers and audiences. Using archival footage and clips from classics as well as interviews with luminaries such as Hou Hsiao-Hsien Sylvia Chang Stanley Kwan and others this is a paean to cinema that traces Taiwan's tumultuous past as well as the richness of Chinese-language films in the past 50 years.
