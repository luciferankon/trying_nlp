Craigslist Room Share is a diverse real life cartoon comedic web series based on everyday roommate situations. Mar Jar Jar Jar (Jamal Henderson) has been given the lease to his dad's old apartment. Mar puts an ad on Craigslist and gets two guys to rent out his spares rooms. Lay Ray (Phuc Cao) gets to the apartment first and gets a bedroom while Jackson Captain (Israel "Izzy" Dixon) comes to the apartment to find out he must sleep in the living room. He has no privacy and can't get his money back. His roommates put him through hell and treat him terribly because he just doesn't seem to be as cool as them.
