In July-August 1987 after 100 shows around the world on The Bridge Tour Billy Joel accepted the Kremlin's invitation to the U.S.S.R. for six fully-staged rock shows in Moscow and Leningrad fulfilling a long-time desire to perform in Russia. During their stay Billy and his family along with musicians staff and a huge press entourage spent their days interacting with the Russian people forging true bonds of friendship wherever they went. For the first time A Matter Of Trust - The Bridge To Russia: The Concert presents an expanded version of what fans saw and heard over a quarter-century ago. The newly remastered concert film originally directed by Wayne Isham adds seven previously unreleased songs to the original 1987 VHS release Live From Leningrad including a bonus performance of Pressure." The performances have been completely remasterd from the original 35 millimeter negatives for the best audiovisual quality. Billy has always believed that going to Russia was the most important thing he'd ever done as a performer. The freedom and excitement of his presence permanently affected the country and played a role in the ultimate dissolution of the U.S.S.R. in 1991. "
