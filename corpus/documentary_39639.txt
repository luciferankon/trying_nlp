Enraged by the policies of George W. Bush two prominent artists Colin Gray and John Nava are compelled to take a political stand in their art for the first time one in a public sculpture exhibit on State Street and the other in a local gallery. The documentary follows the threats tabloid journalism and controversy that ensue as the layers of Santa Barbara's culture media and politics unravel through the perspectives of an eloquent panel of commentators from the professional art world and people interviewed on the streets of Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara reveals itself when a local McDonalds owner begins a fierce campaign to have Colin Gray's sculpture W removed from State Street. This event becomes a fulcrum for an unconventional documentary exploring divergent points of view on political art in Santa Barbara and its sometimes life-threatening consequences.
