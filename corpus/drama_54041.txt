Cary Shep Bill and Francis are pilots who have just and only just survived the First World War. They linger in Europe in the aftermath drinking and ostensibly having fun but pessimistic and flip about their futures as each feels himself somehow lost and dead inside as a result of the horrors he's experienced. They encounter a beautiful and vivacious girl Nikki and adopt her not romantically but as a sort of mascot and light around which they can hover in hopes of regaining a sense of warmth and life. Nikki does her best to reinvigorate her new friends but despite the seeming lightheartedness of their escapades the shadow of the war can never be dispelled.
