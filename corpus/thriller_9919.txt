This is a dramatic chain of events in the most glamorous swinging era of Hindi films... the 1960s. It was a decade when film stars tasted success and carried their larger than life screen image on to real life with unbridled pomp and splendour. It was during this time that two ambitious films were made... Ujwal Nirmal Sheetal and Reena Mera Naam. The latter became a runaway hit while the former was struggling at the box office. Ravi Kumar a successful actor from the South is signed up for a movie opposite Zahra Fernandes a very ambitious actress who has a career rivalry with another actress Chandni. They are both signed up for separate films with 2 different directors. While Zahra's Nirmal Sheetal etc. flops at the box office due to some under-the-table machinations by the director of the other film the best actress award goes to Zahra. At the post-awards night Zahra falls from a high-up balcony and the police swing into action. The film has many other actors all possible suspects and revealing more would expose the plot.
