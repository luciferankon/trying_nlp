Imagine: An alien has landed on a foreign planet where life once existed. The alien moves around aimlessly through dark shifting nature occasionally coming across a frozen figure a human poised in time and action in a deserted wilderness where the sunlight is now out of reach. ALIEN TOURIST comes together as a conglomeration of fragments - of images places frozen moments and echoing sounds that present the viewer with a vision of our world now gone.
