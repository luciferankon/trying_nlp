After midnight a solitary man steps off a city bus. He's wearing a suit and tie carrying an attache case. He walks to his apartment building gets his mail and climbs the stairs to his flat. A neighbor gives him a hard look. He checks the refrigerator surprises a bug on the food he was going to cook abjures dinner and goes to bed. Distant music ("You're an old shoe I've thrown away") a busy mosquito and a card from an ex-lover ("Do you know when I will let you be? Never!") keep him awake. He tries throwing darts at her picture killing the insect and tossing his clock-radio out the window. Can anything but the dawn bring respite?
