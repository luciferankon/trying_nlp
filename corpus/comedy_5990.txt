Soledad descalza (Barefoot Soledad) is a mix of a mockumentary (fake documentary) and narrative fiction that shows a one-year follow up in the life of Soledad Paramo a woman who always goes barefoot everywhere on her own will. The fact that the protagonist goes barefoot is the starting point for a tragicomedy which also deals with other things such as modern art artistic creation social manipulation and the role of communication media and also be interpreted as a vision sometimes satirical of present-day Spanish society.
