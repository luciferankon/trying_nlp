Over a fourteen month period the Phoenix Serial Shooters (Dale Hausner & Samuel Dieteman) terrorized Arizona with a series of bizarre and random murders. On August 3rd 2006 the men were arrested. With more criminal counts than Jeffery Dahmer and the Boston Strangler combined the pair were accused of 36 shootings stabbings arson at two Wal-Mart locations and the murder of several dogs and horses. In the documentary film " RV: Recreational Violence" a term coined by the killers themselves Sam Dieteman's ex-girlfriend Jodie Gonzales and her son PFC Anthony Gonzales (US Army) come forward for the first time to discuss their relationship with Sam and the events surrounding the tragic murders. Gritty dramatizations of this drug fueled descent into hell serve to dissect a life full of addiction and crime as "drug psychosis" and other possible causes of Sam Dieteman's actions are examined. (Backed by a brutal soundtrack of Sam's favorite metal bands.) The Gonzales family's fond recollections of quality time and concert going break the tension to reveal the lighter side of Sam as we explore the darkest corners in the mind of a man gone insane.
