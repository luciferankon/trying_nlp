Our Mutual Girl was unique. Not quite a serial not quite a newsreel and not strictly an advertisement it combined elements of all three. In 52 weekly one-reel episodes running from January 19 1914 to January 11 1915 the Mutual Girl outwitted villains saw the sights of New York met with theatrical and political celebrities (who frequently helped her out of trouble) and tried on fashionable outfits in chic stores. The fashions were an early example of product placement although apparently not paid placement.
