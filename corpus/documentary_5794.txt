Four scientists -- an astrobiologist a NASA planetary scientist a geochemist and an astronomer -- travel to Brazil's City of God an impoverished Rio de Janerio neighborhood where they spend two weeks in a local school teaching kids about science. When they arrive they surprise the kids with an amazing once-in-a-lifetime experiment: the chance to do their own exploring on Mars using an actual NASA spacecraft.
