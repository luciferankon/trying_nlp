The evil villain is defeated and the heroine finally gets to kiss her prince. And they all live happily ever after... or at least some of them did. While that the villains of these fairy tale stories have been defeated it all seems to be fine except now in the rubble of these bad guys their teenage children are left alone to fend for themselves. As the heroes of our stories they want to give these children the benefit of the doubt But of course there are obligations that must be met. Each child must post some sort of update video and at least once a week the children have to video chat in a sort of "therapy session." At the end they're given a choice: to be good or to follow in the steps of their parents.
