A 19 years old London girl received agressive psychiatric treatments for her schizophrenic behaviour by a doctor who still wants her family to insure the guard of the child without any regards to the facts that it is this family who's agravating her situation. Based on the work of the genius R D Laing. Smashes the idealistic 'pie in the sky' perceptions of 'the family' to smithereens. Arguably Loach's best work. Cannot recommend this film enough and also the necessity for people to read and learn from R D Laing.
