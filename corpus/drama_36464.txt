Gossett and Rowlands find themselves in a dispute over the custody of a young adorable biracial girl who just happens to be their grandchild. The child's (Jacey) parents are Gossett's son and Rowland's daughter and have died in a tragic accident leaving the granddaughter's custody up in the air. Both Grandparents want custody but Rowlands is an older Southern woman who still easily sees the difference between black and white and it is deeper than just skin color. Gossett is also older and not without his preconceived notions of whites either but together they get to know each other as people not stereotypes through the love of a grandchild.
