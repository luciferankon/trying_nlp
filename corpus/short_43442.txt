The Rev. Darwin Kirby is in love with a woman who is fond of all the gaieties of life. She refuses to marry him and finally the preacher gives up the pulpit for the love of the girl. But he has not been trained in pathos of the world and fails to make good. Finally he goes west for a new start leaving his wife behind. Lonely she takes up with an old sweetheart and spends much of her time with him. The western venture does not prove profitable and sick and disconsolate the former preacher returns east. He finds his wife in a caf√© with the other man. Goaded to fury by jealousy he shoots his rival. Thinking he has killed him he hides in the slums where he drops to the lowest depths of degradation. But one day he hears that the man he shot is not dead. Calling together all his willpower he determines to mend his ways. He makes a man of himself and re-enters the ministry. Then he seeks the wife he still loves. She tired and sick of the consequences of her gay life consents to begin anew and the two start together on the right path.
