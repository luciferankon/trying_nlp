After escaping her abductor a young woman named Sara walks into a hospital and collapses. Once her physical wounds heal she's transferred to the psychiatric ward for observation and therapy. Sara's recovery is hampered by her hatred and distrust towards men. When her psychotropic medicine wears off she sees men with a Devil face. To complicate the matter her psychiatrist is a man. Sara's convinced that he was her abductor and attacks him. Under sedation Sara goes to her "happy place" to find her redemption. She has a boyfriend named Tommy whom she knew before her abduction. Sara takes on a job at a strip club to satisfy her need to control men and convinces Tommy to take her to his home. When her medicine begins to wear off Tommy's place turns into an abandoned missile base; the very place that she was held captive. Sara tries to escape but a series of storms that develop outside the base and in her mind keep her at bay. Sara begins to see Tommy in a Devil face and controlled by her psychiatrist. Sara finally escapes but only in thought as she's still in the ward. Sara's medicated and once again goes to her "happy place". Sara ends up back in the missile base but takes on the role as abductor. She lures her psychiatrist in and forces him to confess his abuse of her and the murder of her father. Satisfied Sara locks him up in an escape hatch and leaves him to die. She dreams of her and Tommy enjoying their young daughter at a playground. For Sara justice has been served and her sanity restored until she suddenly awakens to the sound of voices. To Sara's horror she's back in the psychiatric ward and observes Tommy and her psychiatrist in Devil face.
