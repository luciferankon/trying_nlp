An elderly shop-keeper and his grand-daughter are threatened by the rich mean-spirited dwarf Quilp and decide to flee across England to escape him. They are pursued both by Quilp and by the shop-keeper's long-lost brother who wants to find them for a different reason. Quilp ('Hay Petrie' (qv)) is a money-lender who persecutes Little Nell('Elaine Benson (I)' (qv)) and her grandfather ('Ben Webster (I)' (qv)) finally taking over their curiosity shop. Simultaneously the grandfather's long-lost brother now wealthy is seeking the pair who flee before the menacing Quilp and Nell and her grandfather join a wax works exhibition.
