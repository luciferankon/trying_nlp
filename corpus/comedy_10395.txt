Eugčne who works for Radio-Europe is a bit dim-witted. He lives in a block of flats whose caretaker is Madame Motte and the lady is in love with the young man. Just for laughs Eugčne's friends circulate on the air the rumor that Eugčne has inherited millions of francs. It does not take long before a swarm of 'friends' start mixing with him. After a while considering that the joke has lasted long enough the jokers reveal the truth. Eugčne immediately loses all his 'friends' but not he girl he loves. Even better Eugčne actually inherits a big sum of money. He who laughs last laughs best!
