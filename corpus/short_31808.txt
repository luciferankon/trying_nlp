First Comes Love consists of perfectly choreographed scenes of four wedding ceremonies accompanied by a complex medley of popular love songs. All seems to be going as it should until the couples reach the altar when the celebratory atmosphere is interrupted for a surprising public service announcement. Then song and dance continues until the happy couples depart leaving behind a dwindling crowd and a few altar boys who carefully sweep up the rice that blankets the pavement like snow. The film doesn't attempt to defend--or discredit--the institution of marriage. Instead it reveals the many subtle emotions surrounding the event and raises questions about how the double standard regarding marriage affects gay and straight couples.
