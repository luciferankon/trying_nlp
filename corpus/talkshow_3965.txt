Well-Being in the Modern Age (WITMA) is a live pop-up conversation series focused on practical methods for living a healthy and connected life. Bringing together leading voices from across the wellness creative and media worlds WITMA provides a space for discussions centered around creating a greater awareness of our internal and external worlds. We believe that honest and authentic communication evokes a sense of community that is a catalyst for positive change both individually and collectively. Produced by MindPod Network Noah Lampert Sah D'Simone Kara Erickson and Anna Lundgaard Lewis.
