The Rev. T. Lawrence Shannon has been living in Mexico for two years working as a tourist guide for a cut-rate travel agency. Shannon lost his church and was defrocked after taking liberties with one of his parishioners. He's now accompanying a group of middle-aged ladies from Texas whose leader Judith Fellowes is keeping a close eye on her teenage ward Charlotte Goodall who definitely has an interest in the former priest. After Charlotte and Shannon spend the night together Fellowes is out to have him fired and to keep her from communicating with his employer Shannon strands them at a remote hotel run by his good friend Maxine Faulk. It's the arrival of Hannah Jelkes and her elderly grandfather that has the greatest impact however. Her approach to life and love forces Shannon to deal with his demons and re-evaluate his life. When American minister Reverend T. Lawrence Shannon is expelled from his Virginia church he travels to Mexico in search of his destiny and sanity. There he becomes a tour guide for a bus load of spinsters and a teenage nymphet named Charlotte Goodall who is being chaperoned by the group's leader the inflexible Judith Fellowes. Miss Fellowes who is quite jealous of Charlotte's attentions to Shannon discovers the young woman in his room and vows to have him fired. To thwart her plot Shannon takes control of the bus from Hank the bus driver and speeds the tour group on a wild ride through the Mexican jungle to the crumbling secluded hotel of an old friend the recently widowed Maxine Falk. Eventually Shannon becomes enamored with another guest at the hotel the rather genteel Hanna Jelkes an itinerant quick sketch artist and her poet grandfather Nonno. As the wise Hanna partially restores Shannon's fractured world Shannon struggles to get back the rest of his sanity and his self-respect.
