For decades farmers and biologists have sought ways to reduce pesticide use in agriculture. An effective response to this problem has been the Biological Control a technique that consists in opposing the insect pest natural enemy also called "beneficial insect." By the Biological Control is now possible not only to reduce the use of pesticides but avoid economic devastation created by certain pests with all job losses it entails. In our country the SENASICA (National Service for Food Sanity Safety and Quality) is responsible for conducting cutting-edge research on biological control as well as the mass production of this "beneficial insects" and its distribution to farmers.
