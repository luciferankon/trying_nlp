Australian Survivor is a game show where 24 everyday Australians are divided into three tribes and are on an island with little more than the clothes on their backs and must survive for 55 days. These people compete in challenges for rewards and more importantly immunity. At the end of each day one person will be voted out. Throughout this game there will be a series of advantages that will help people get further in the game. One of these people will outwit outplay & outlast the others to win the title of Sole Survivor and the grand prize of $500000.
