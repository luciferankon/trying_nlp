A genius General Sir John Monash designs a way to crash through the German lines on August 8th 1918 in Amiens France. This triggers the end of WW1. For decades he has been whitewashed out and/or deleted from WW1 accounts of history. Why? Because he was Australian and the first Jewish general to command a national army since Roman times.
