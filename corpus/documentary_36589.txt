This timely documentary by photographer David Neilson tells the story of this critically endangered bird and the efforts by a number of people to save the species from extinction. There are less than 30 of these beautiful small parrots living in the wild. They breed over the summer at Port Davey in South West Tasmania and then cross Bass Strait to spend the winter on the mainland coast. Filming from close quarters has enabled various aspects of the Orange-bellied Parrot's behavior to be shown on film for the first time. Scientists working on the recovery efforts are interviewed along with footage of their field work. The future prospects of this species so close to the edge of extinction are also canvassed.
