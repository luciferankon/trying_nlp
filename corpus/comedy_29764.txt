Misters DÃ¶lken Ivo and Sichel all living peacefully in a lunatic asylum in Austria are about to spend their summer in a special camp for those who are challenged by life. When their driver suffers a heart-attack near a little village the three men think they have reached their destination. Instantly feeling at home in the village they all soon meet new people. When the townsfolk hear that three lunatics have broken out they start searching for them frantically - and as the mayor's old mother is reported missing this search looks like the one for Frankenstein's monster. Actually the everyday people of the village are mentally not that far away from the three sympathetic strangers who blend in perfectly enriching the little villages' strange normalness by their presence.
