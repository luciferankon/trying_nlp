Three stories set in today's Algeria. In Algiers Mourad a property developer is wealthy and more or less satisfied with his lot but he does not know how to make happy those close to him; Lila his confused ex-wife; Rash his frustrated second wife; Nacim his disenchanted son. Djabil Mourad's chauffeur has accepted to drive Aicha and his father from Algiers to Biskra where the young woman is to be married civilly. Now Djabil happens to be Aicha's lover. In SÃ©tif Dahman a neurologist hopes to marry Radia at last. But the promotion he expects seems to be put off forever. He is in double trouble when a woman accuses him of serious wrongdoing.
